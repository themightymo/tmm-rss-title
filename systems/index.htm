<p>Three of the biggest breakthroughs in how we understand and
successfully guide changes in ourselves, others and organizations
are systems theory, systems thinking and systems tools. To understand
how they are used, we first must understand the concept of a system.
Many of us have an intuitive understanding of the concept. However,
we need to make that intuition even more explicit in order to
use systems thinking and systems tools.</p>

<h3>What's a System?</h3>

<p>Adapted from the <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/pubs/CN-gdes/CN-FP.htm"
target="_blank">Field Guide to Consulting and Organizational Development:
Collaborative and Systems Approach to Performance Change and Learning</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest breakthroughs in how we understand and guide
change in organizations is systems theory and systems thinking.
To understand how they are used in organizations, we first must
understand a system. Many of us have an intuitive understanding
of the term. However, we need to make the understanding explicit
in order to use systems thinking and systems tools in organizations.</p>

<p>Simply put, a system is an organized collection of parts (or
subsystems) that are highly integrated to accomplish an overall
goal. The system has various inputs, which go through certain
processes to produce certain outputs, which together, accomplish
the overall desired goal for the system. So a system is usually
made up of many smaller systems, or subsystems. For example, an
organization is made up of many administrative and management
functions, products, services, groups and individuals. If one
part of the system is changed, the nature of the overall system
is often changed, as well -- by definition then, the system is
systemic, meaning relating to, or affecting, the entire system.
(This is not to be confused with systematic, which can mean merely
that something is methodological. Thus, methodological thinking
-- systematic thinking -- does not necessarily mean systems thinking.)</p>

<p>Systems range from simple to complex. There are numerous types
of systems. For example, there are biological systems (for example,
the heart), mechanical systems (for example, a thermostat), human/mechanical
systems (for example, riding a bicycle), ecological systems (for
example, predator/prey) and social systems (for example, groups,
supply and demand and also friendship). Complex systems, such
as social systems, are comprised of numerous subsystems, as well.
These subsystems are arranged in hierarchies, and integrated to
accomplish the overall goal of the overall system. Each subsystem
has its own boundaries of sorts, and includes various inputs,
processes, outputs and outcomes geared to accomplish an overall
goal for the subsystem. Complex systems usually interact with
their environments and are, thus, open systems.</p>

<p>A high-functioning system continually exchanges feedback among
its various parts to ensure that they remain closely aligned and
focused on achieving the goal of the system. If any of the parts
or activities in the system seems weakened or misaligned, the
system makes necessary adjustments to more effectively achieve
its goals.</p>

<p>A pile of sand is not a system. If you remove a sand particle,
you have still got a pile of sand. However, a functioning car
is a system. Remove the carburetor and you no longer have a working
car.</p>

<h2>Five Disciplines of Systems Thinking
-- Per Peter Senge</h2>

<p>Peter Senge wrote a seminal book about systems thinking, <i>The
Fifth Discipline</i> (Doubleday, 1990). In his book, he suggested
five disciplines necessary to cultivate systems thinking in an
effort or organization. In addition to the discipline of systems
thinking, he suggests the following four disciplines, as well.</p>

<h3>Personal Mastery</h3>

<p>Senge describes personal mastery as &quot;continually clarifying
and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of
developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively&quot; (<i>The
Fifth Discipline</i>, Doubleday, 1990, p. 7).<br />

<h3>Mental Models</h3>

<p>Senge explains &quot;Mental models are deeply ingrained assumptions,
generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence how
we understand the world and how we take action&quot; (p. 8).<br />

<h3>Building Shared Vision</h3>

<p>Senge notes &quot;If any one idea about leadership has inspired
organizations for thousands of years, it's the capacity to hold
a shared picture of the future we seek to create&quot; (p. 9).<br />

<h3>Team Learning</h3>

<p>Senge asks &quot;How can a team of committed managers with
individual IQs above 120 have a collective IQ of 63?&quot; (p.
9.).He adds &quot;Team learning is vital because teams, not individuals,
are the fundamental learning unit in modern organizations&quot;
(p. 10).<br />

<h2><a name="chaos" id="chaos"></a>Chaos Theory -- Seeing Patterns and Themes 
  in Chaos</h2>
<p>Systems theory has evolved to another level called chaos theory. In this context, 
  chaos does not mean total confusion. Chaos refers to the dynamics of a system 
  that apparently has no, or little, order, but in which there really is an underlying 
  order. In these systems, small changes can cause complex changes in the overall 
  system. (In technical terms, chaos theory applies to complex non-linear dynamics 
  systems.) Chaos theory has introduced new perspectives and tools to study complex 
  systems, such as biological, human, groups, weather, population growth and the 
  solar system. <br />
