<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>This module helps you get ready for the program by providing
guidelines to get the most out of the program, along with suggesting
numerous free, online resources of which you might take advantage.</p>

<p>As with any learning module in this program, you'll get the
most if you read all materials, consider each question for discussion
and reflection, discuss information and materials with others,
complete suggested activities and apply assessments as appropriate.
You should also regularly conduct action planning to record and
monitor important actions (for yourself or your business organization)
identified during the program, including what needs to be done,
who needs to do it, by when and current status on the completion
of the tasks.</p>

<p>Lastly, congratulations, on your own initiative and commitment
to your learning!</p>

<h2>SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR REFLECTION AND DISCUSSION</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to discuss the following
  questions with peers, board members, management and employees,
  as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>The following suggestions and activities are based on
  the readings from the above &quot;Materials for Review&quot;.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. You'll learn the most -- and develop needed systems for
your organization -- by a) actually applying information and materials
from this program and b) sharing feedback with others about these
experiences. List at least two groups of people (peers, board
members, management, employees, etc.) with whom you will share
ongoing feedback during this program.</p>

<p>2. What do you do to deal with stress in your private and work
life? This question is critical to the success of this program,
and particularly to the success of your organization! List at
least three support systems (friends, to-do lists, etc.) you will
use to support you as you a) start your new organization and b)
apply information and materials from the program? (You might find
useful ideas in some of the articles in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/time-stress-management.htm"
class="textlink">Stress Management</a>.)</p>

<p>3. From reading the above-listed Materials for Review, list
at least two useful tips for you to read more effectively? Study
more effectively?</p>

<p>4. Are there any other key questions that you should reflect
on and / or discuss with others to ensure the program remains
meaningful to you? <br />
</p>

<h2>SUGGESTED LEARNING ACTIVITIES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web
  address, a box might open, asking you which software application
  to open the document.)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Write down a schedule of when you plan to study information
and materials in the program. Share the schedule with several
people who can help you stay on track with your schedule, for
example, peers, fellow board members, management, employees, consultants,
friends, family, etc. Give them permission to pose supportive
challenges to you to help you stay on track.</p>

<p>2. Write and distribute a one-page memo to whomever you plan
to share feedback with (peers, board members, management and employees,
etc.) indicating your plans to complete the program and that you
plan to discuss information and materials with them (for example,
in upcoming board meetings, staff meetings, etc). Suggest the
program to them, as well.</p>

<p>3. Schedule regular meeting times (for example, in meetings
with peers, board members, management, employees, etc.) to discuss
information and materials from this program. Share the schedule
with others.</p>

<p>4. Recruit fellow learners to go through the program with you.
You could, for example:<br />
a.) Contact local service providers to get suggestions for other
learners -- or ask them if they would sponsor the program. <br />
b.) Call several peers, for example, board members, chief executives,
managers, consultants, instructors, etc., and pose the program
to them.</p>

<p>5. Join the free, online discussion group, <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>. This group is attended
by 1,000s of experts about business and organizations. As you
proceed through the program, you can pose questions to the group.</p>

<p>6. Are there other activities that would be more suitable for
your needs and nature? Commit to undertaking these activities
-- by undertaking, we mean other than thinking about or talking
about, but starting and completing the activities. Write down
your ideas and share them with whomever is going to support you
as you progress through the program.</p>

<p>7. Lastly, spend an hour over the coming week in which you
scan around inside the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/"
class="textlink">Free Management Library</a>. There are a massive
amount of links in the Library, including about 675 topics. Get
a feel for how they are arranged.</p>

<p>8. OPTIONAL: The following three links are to a large amount
of free, online resources in regard to personal development, productivity
and wellness. If you have the time, you might glance around inside
the topics. If you find something that might benefit you, consider
identifying suitable actions to take. Write down these planned
actions and share them with others who can support you as you
take the actions.<br />

<h2>OPTIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>OPTIONAL: The following self-assessments can help you
  identify areas where you'd like further self-development.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nsba.org/sbot/toolkit/BehavSty.html" target="_blank"
class="textlink">Behavioral Styles</a> -- Take a look at the following
matrix of behavioral styles. See where you fit in. How might that
affect how you proceed through the eMBA?</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.aimmconsult.com/SamplePBAFlex.html" target="_blank"
class="textlink">Personal Flexibility Assessment</a> -- Are you
really ready for change? For implementing this eMBA?</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.quintcareers.com/SWOT_Analysis.html" target="_blank"
class="textlink">Identify Your Strengths and Weaknesses</a> --
Based on the SWOT analysis, what did you learn about yourself?
Use your strengths to take advantage of opportunities, to strengthen
weaknesses and ward off threats. Any strategies that you should
implement?</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.karmaresources.com/selfevals/stress.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Stress Self-Evaluation</a> --
To determine how effectively you are using your time, respond
to these questions honestly</p>

<p>(<a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/self-assessments.htm"
class="textlink">More self-assessments</a> if you are interested.)</p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
