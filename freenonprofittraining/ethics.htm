<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The management of ethics in the workplace holds tremendous
benefits for everyone, benefits both moral -- and even practical.
This is particularly true today when it is critical to understand
and manage highly diverse values in the workplace, and at a time
when too many people still feel that business ethics is a topic
for philosophy or is about shaming and blaming people. This module
aims to make the topic of business ethics very understandable
and accessible.</p>

<p>The field of business ethics has traditionally been the domain
of philosophers, academics and social critics. Consequently, much
of today's literature about business ethics is not geared toward
the practical needs of leaders and managers -- the people primarily
responsible for managing ethics in the workplace. The most frequent
forms of business ethics literature today typically include: a)
philosophical, which requires extensive orientation and analysis;
b) anthologies, which require much time, review and integration;
c) case studies, which require numerous cases, and much time and
analyses to synthesize; and d) extended stories about businesses
&quot;gone bad&quot;.</p>

<p>This lack of practical information is not the fault of philosophers,
academics or social critics. The problem is the outcome of insufficient
involvement of leaders and managers in discussions and literature
about business ethics. More leaders and managers must become more
involved. This module aims to help address this issue.</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Draft a code of ethics for your organization. Remember to
include examples of preferred behaviors with each of the values
in your code of ethics. Present the code to your board, explain
its purpose and how you'd like to use it, e.g., to discuss it
with staff members, post it throughout your organization and renew
it annually. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm#anchor43623"
class="textlink">Ethics Tools: Codes of Ethics</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm#anchor50477"
class="textlink">Ethics Tools: Codes of Conduct</a> .)</p>

<p>2. Pose an ethical dilemma (from the reviewed materials) to
the staff and walk them through application of one of the three
methods to resolve ethical dilemmas (these methods are included
in the materials, as well). (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm#anchor53723"
class="textlink">Ethics Tools: Resolving Ethical Dilemmas</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Refer to your mental list of the mostly likely ethical dilemmas
to occur in your organization. Would these potential dilemmas
be addressed by current policies and procedures? Note what policies
and procedures need to be added (included yearly review of your
code of ethics) and propose them to a local personnel expert.
Update your policies handbook and explain the additions to all
organization members. (See Ethics<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm#anchor52197"
class="textlink"> Tools: Policies and Procedures</a>.)</p>

<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>Culture is comprised of the values, norms, folkways and behaviors
of an organization. Ethics is about moral values, or values regarding
right and wrong. Therefore, cultural assessments can be extremely
valuable when assessing the moral values in an organization. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/index.htm#anchor1227695">Assessing
and Cultivating Ethical Culture</a></p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<a name="anchor695302"></a>
<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
