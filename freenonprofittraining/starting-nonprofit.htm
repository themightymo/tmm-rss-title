<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>This module is useful to entrepreneurs who are thinking about
starting a nonprofit, or have already started their nonprofit
and what to understand more about what they're really doing. The
module also will be useful to practitioners/consultants who want
a broader understanding about nonprofit organizations, including
how they are started. This understanding for practitioners/consultants
can help them provide more effective services to clients and establish
stronger credibility with leaders and managers in the nonprofit
workplace.</p>

<p>Starting a nonprofit organization requires careful thought
and planning about your new organization. However, you can't effectively
manage an organization if you can't effectively manage yourself.
So in this module, you are first guided through some careful examination
about yourself as an entrepreneur (and you are an entrepreneur if
you are starting an organization). If you decide you still want
to start a nonprofit, then you'll consider various options to
&quot;jump start&quot; your organization, including fiscal sponsorship
and using an incubator service. Next, you are guided through a
variety of checklists to help you legally register your nonprofit
in the particular form you desire, for example, as a nonprofit
corporation, as a nonprofit that is exempt from paying federal
and other taxes, etc.</p>

<p>Maintaining a healthy nonprofit organization requires healthy
practices in governance and management. This nonprofit organization
development program is geared to develop those healthy practices
in your nonprofit. To truly understand and be effective at these
practices, it helps greatly if board members, executive directors
and staff have some basic understanding of the overall organizational
&quot;system&quot; of their nonprofit organization, including
its common traits, dimensions, &quot;personality&quot; and life
cycles. This is not just an academic exercise. Too often, people
don't really understand the overall structures in their nonprofit.
When problems occur, they only see the specific events, and not
the larger structures that cause the behaviors that cause the
events. To effectively resolve problems, you have to change the
structures -- not just react to events.</p>

<p>The importance of this understanding of organizations is evident
when you realize that many graduate business training programs
start out with an overview of the organizational system, often
in a course called, for example, &quot;Organizational Theory&quot;.</p>

class="textlink">Table of Reminders for Registering Your New Nonprofit</a>.)</p>

<p>6. Do the terms &quot;tax-exempt&quot; and &quot;tax deductible&quot;

class="textlink">First Things First -- What Do You Mean by &quot;Starting
a Nonprofit&quot;?</a>)</p>

<p>7. What does the IRS classification &quot;501(c)(3)&quot; mean?
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-nonprofit.htm#anchor1465078"

class="textlink">Table of Reminders for Registering Your New Nonprofit</a>.)</p>

<h2>Understanding the Nonprofit Organization</h2>

<p>1. What is a basic definition of an organization? An organization
gets ongoing direction primarily from mission, vision and values.
That's why it's so important for boards, management and staff
to understand these concepts and how they apply to their nonprofit.
What is a mission? Vision? Values? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/definition.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Definition of Organization (which includes
some optional reading about systems thinking)</a>.)</p>

<p>2. It helps a great deal to think of organizations and programs
as systems, for example, when planning programs and evaluations
or managing major changes in your organization. What is a system?
(HINT: Think about inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes.) How
is a system different than a pile of sand? What are some common
characteristics of systems. How is an organization like a system?
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/definition.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Definition of Organization (which includes
some optional reading about systems thinking)</a>.)</p>

<p>3. What metaphor do you prefer to describe organizations? Machines?
Organisms? Persons? Groups? Families? Others? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/metaphor.htm"
class="textlink">Various Ways to Look at Organizations.</a>)</p>

<p>4. Organizations have certain dimensions and concepts in common.
When designing, organizing and/or re-organizing organizations,
it helps to be aware of these dimensions and concepts. Name at
least three of the dimensions of organizations. Name at least
three key concepts to consider when designing organizations. (See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/dimensions.htm"
class="textlink">Common Dimensions in Organizations</a> and <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/concepts.htm" class="textlink">Key
Concepts in the Design of an Organization</a>.)</p>

<p>5. The concept of culture is VERY important. Each organization
has its own unique culture, particularly in nonprofits. When managing
a nonprofit, it's important to acknowledge what values are really
important to the organization, what behaviors typically occur
and what behaviors are really treasured. Lack of understanding
about culture is one of the major reasons that organizational
change efforts fail. Describe the concept of organizational &quot;culture&quot;.
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/culture.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Culture (the &quot;personality&quot;
of the organization)</a>.)</p>

<p>6. People -- like most other systems -- go through life cycles.
When trying to understand, manage or help a system, it's very
important to you know what life cycle the system is in. This is
true for organizations as well. Organizations have life cycles.
This is often forgotten when trying to work with organizations.
Describe the concept of organizational life cycle. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/life-cycles.htm"
class="textlink">Life Cycles of Organizations</a>.)</p>

<p>7. What is the &quot;new paradigm&quot;? What are several of
the changes that might be expected in this new paradigm? What
major, overall driving forces are causing this new paradigm? (See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/paradigms.htm"
class="textlink">Driving Forces and a New Organizational Paradigm</a>.)</p>

<p>8. What are the seven key roles in a nonprofit (as listed in
the materials for review)? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/nonprofits.htm#anchor249619"
class="textlink">Key Roles</a>.)</p>

<p>9. What are the three major sections of nonprofit personnel
(as listed in the materials for review) (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/nonprofits.htm#anchor251653"
class="textlink">Three Aspects of Nonprofit Structure</a>.)</p>

<p>10. What is devolution? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/nonprofits.htm#anchor4294429068"
class="textlink">Current Major Challenge: Devolution</a>.)</p>

<p>11. How would you describe the typical nature of a small nonprofit
organization? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/nonprofits.htm#anchor252655"
class="textlink">Unique Nature and Struggles of Traditional Small
Nonprofits</a>.)</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and staff, as appropriate.</li>
  <li>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are operating in an already established nonprofit,
  you can skip to the subsections titled &quot;Understanding Your
  Organization ...&quot; below.</li>
  <li>Note that the information in the subsections &quot;Understanding
  Your Organization ...&quot; is enough to give you a basic sense
  of your organization, including its structure and basic parts,
  its current (or desired) personality, and feedback among the
  basic parts. You'll soon learn a great deal more about your nonprofit
  as you progress through the remaining modules in this program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting/Registering Your New Nonprofit</h2>

<p>1. Write a five- to ten-sentence description of the charitable
purpose of your nonprofit. This is the mission statement of your
new nonprofit. What is the nature of your organization's services,
e.g., advocacy, arts, civic, cultural, health, education, human
services, or other? (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm#anchor323314"
class="textlink">Writing/Updating a Mission Statement</a>.)</p>

<p>2. Find out the minimum number of people required to be on
a nonprofit, corporate board of directors in your state. You might
call, for example, your Attorney General's office, States Attorneys
office, etc. Recruit at least this number of people to join your
board. (For assistance, see <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor579041"
class="textlink">Overview of Board Roles and Responsibilities</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/joining-boards.htm"
class="textlink">Joining a Board</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/recruiting-members.htm"
class="textlink">Recruiting Board Members</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Recruit expertise to help you get your nonprofit started.
A great place to start is by getting references from other small
nonprofits. Don't forget about finding an insurance agent. You'll
probably soon need liability and property insurance. (For assistance,
see <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/index.htm#anchor3916681"
class="textlink">Getting a Bank and Banker</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/joining-boards.htm"
class="textlink">Joining a Board</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm#anchor904870"
class="textlink">Hiring Consultants</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/working-with-lawyers.htm"
class="textlink">Getting and Using a Lawyer</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor1442509"
class="textlink">Getting and Using Accounting Services</a> and
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessinsurance/index.htm#anchor565740"
class="textlink">Insurance for Nonprofits</a>.)</p>

<p>4. If you plan to incorporate your nonprofit, draft a set of
Articles of Incorporation (or whatever other type of legal charter
is required, for example, a constitution, Articles of Association,
etc.). (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor133574"
class="textlink">Articles of Incorporation</a>.)</p>

<p>5. Draft a set of bylaws (bylaws specify how your board will
govern the organization and how it will be configured, for example,
with an executive director, etc.). (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/documents/bylaws.htm"
class="textlink">Corporate Bylaws</a>.)</p>

<p>6. If you plan to file for exemption from federal taxes, contact
the IRS to obtain the necessary forms. Begin completing the forms
when they arrive. (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/taxes/nonprofit-taxes.htm#anchor648922"
class="textlink">Getting Tax-Exempt Status</a>.)</p>

<p>7. Make a draft (probably a <i>very</i> rough draft at this
point) of a plan that includes the top 5-8 goals for the nonprofit
to accomplish over the next year. Think about what resources are
needed to achieve these goals. (This is a <i>very</i> rough draft
of a strategic plan.) Write down the costs for the resources and
group them in major categories including: personnel, computers,
office supplies, facilities (rent, utilities, etc.) and any other
major groups of costs. This is a <i>very</i> rough draft of a
yearly budget. You don't have to go into great detail at this
point. (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Guidelines for Successful Planning Process</a> and 
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Description of Strategic Planning</a>.)</p>

<p>8. Hold a meeting of your board of directors. In the meeting,
members should review the drafts of the Articles, bylaws, application
to the IRS for tax-exempt status, strategic plan and budget. Members
should vote to approve the drafted items. Members should also
vote to select officers. Your state may require that boards have
certain officer roles, for example, Chair/President, Secretary
and Treasurer. (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/sample-minutes.htm"

<h2>Understanding Your Nonprofit Organization -- Its Logic Model</h2>

<p>1. Diagram a logic model of your organization, including its
inputs, processes, outputs (tangible results) and outcomes (impacts
on clients). (Note that this systems view is sometimes called
an &quot;outcomes model&quot;, which is very useful when designing
outcomes-based evaluations or writing proposals in grant applications.)

Logic Model</a></p>

<p>2. If possible, diagram a basic systems view of your programs,
including inputs, processes, outputs (tangible results) and outcomes
(impacts on clients). (Note that we'll soon give more attention
to programs, including their design and marketing, in an upcoming
learning module.) Fill in the table in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/diagramming-your-nonprofit.htm"

Logic Model</a></p>

<h2>Understanding Your Nonprofit Organization -- Its &quot;Personality&quot;</h2>

<p>1. Write a half-page description of the culture of your organization.
Include what values your organizations holds dear and what values
you see reflected by the behaviors in your nonprofit. Note that
if your nonprofit is still fairly new, you can still benefit from
this activity by describing what you'd like to see as the &quot;personality&quot;
of your organization. This activity will be useful later on during
strategic planning when writing values statements. (For assistance,
see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/culture.htm"

of the organization)</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/fp_np.htm#anchor766418"
class="textlink">Unique Nature and Struggles of Traditional Small
Nonprofits.</a>)</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Nonprofit Organization -- Its Life Cycle</h2>

<p>1. Write a half-page description of the life cycle of your
organization. Is it in Birth? Youth? Midlife? Maturity? Include
what characteristics you observe that lead you to conclude that
your organization is in that life cycle. Note what life cycle
will be next for your organization. Include description of any
challenges that you might expect when you go through the next
life cycle change. (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/life-cycles.htm"
class="textlink">Life Cycles of Organizations</a>.)</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Nonprofit Organization -- Its Communications</h2>

<p>1. In the materials for review, you learned that organizations
are systems and that for systems to thrive, their needs to be
continued and effective feedback (communications) between its
major parts. What can you do to ensure effective communications
between the key roles in your nonprofit, including clients, board
members, board committees, board chair, executive director, staff
and volunteers? Effective communications requires more than good
intentions. What specific structures can you use, for example,
consider reports from the director, meeting minutes, staff meetings,
etc. (For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor776411"
class="textlink">Basics of Internal Communications</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/index.htm"

Skills</a>.)</p>

<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<h3>Assessments for New or Already-Established Nonprofits</h3>

<p>Use any or all of the following assessments to evaluate the
health of your new or already established nonprofit organization.
<br />
1. Answer the questions in the &quot;Legal Indicators&quot; in
the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/index.htm"
class="textlink">Checklist of Nonprofit Indicators</a>. Have you
completed all of the necessary activities to conform to U.S. regulations
(for example, to maintain tax exempt status)?</p>

<h2>Additional Assessments for Already-Established Nonprofits</h2>

<p>1. If you are just starting your nonprofit, the following assessments
may be advanced at this point. However, if you are from an already-established
nonprofit, then you might apply some or all of the following assessments:<br />

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
