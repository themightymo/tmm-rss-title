<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In new businesses, &quot;management&quot; is often considered
&quot;whatever needs to be done just to keep things afloat&quot;.
However, for your business to grow and remain healthy, you must
master certain basic skills in management and leadership -- skills
that will help you avoid the crisis situations where you have
to do &quot;whatever it takes to stay afloat&quot;. The basic
skills include problem solving and decision making, planning,
meeting management, delegation, communications and managing yourself.</p>

<p>Those basics are also the foundation from which to develop
more advanced practices in management and leadership. When organizational
personnel struggle, it's often because they've forgotten the basics
-- not because they aren't implementing state-of-the-art techniques
in management and leadership.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT THE LARGE SIZE OF THIS MODULE: This module references
numerous basic skills that leaders and managers must master in
order to be effective in their organizations and their lives.
These skills can be practiced throughout this program and in other
areas of learners' lives. Readers who are interested in gaining
broader contexts of management and leadership can review optional
readings suggested in the &quot;Materials for Review&quot; section
below.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT ORDER OF MODULES: Therefore, it is common to start
management training programs with an overview of the board of
directors (if the program includes focus on corporations, which
are governed by boards of directors) -- the board of directors
is legally charged to govern a corporation. However, in this program,
this learning module about basic skills in management and leadership
is presented before the learning module about boards of directors.
The reason for this order of modules is as follows. Frequently
businesses are started by someone with a strong vision for a new
product. That person often goes on to become the first chief executive
of the new business. Typically, that person also takes a very
strong role (often the leading role) in the initial organization
and development of the board of directors. Therefore, modules
in this program are organized to help the founder (and often the
first chief executive) to effectively apply basic skills in management
and leadership when organizing the board of directors.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT LEARNING SUPERVISION -- Supervision is a major aspect
of managing and leading. There are certain roles and responsibilities
-- and experiences -- that are highly unique to the role of supervision
and highly critical to the success of the organization. Therefore,
the topic of staffing and supervision will also be addressed in
an upcoming module in this program.</p>

presented in your materials for review?</p>

<h2>Basics of Planning</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>For assistance in answering the following questions, see
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor227105"
  class="textlink">Planning</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Describe each of the following terms: Goals. Objectives.

<h2>Delegation</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>For assistance in answering the following questions, see
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor913749"

how to delegate? Delegation is a critical skill in the effective
management of organizations. What can you do to start overcoming
these challenge(s)?</p>

<h2>Basics of Internal Communications</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>For assistance in answering the following questions, see
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor776411"
  class="textlink">Basics of Internal Communications</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. What should be included in status reports (according to
the materials for review)? How often should status reports be
shared and with whom? Your wishes may disagree with those asserted
in the materials for review. That's fine -- just be able to specify
your own terms for status reports, including what's in them,  how often they are shared with whom.</p>

<p>2. What might you include in regular monthly meetings with
all of your employees in attendance? Do you agree that you should
have regular meetings with all employees in attendance? If not,
then how will you really ensure that employees are aware of activities
in the organization? Do they know now? Are you really sure? Seriously
consider holding regular meetings. These meetings can go a long
way toward building a strong sense of community and ensuring effective
communications throughout the organization.</p>

<p>3. How do you ensure that all key employees are aware of important
information and activities in the organization? As noted in the
materials for review, new managers and supervisors often assume
that everyone else knows what they know. This is a mistake. Seriously
consider holding regular meetings with key staff. Don't just rely
on good intentions to communicate or &quot;working harder to communicate&quot;.
Actually make some changes in policies and procedures to ensure
effective communications.</p>

<h2>Meeting Management</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>For assistance in answering the following questions, see
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor226881"

</ul>

<p>1. How can you ensure that the right people are included in
your meetings?</p>

<p>2. What's the best way to design an agenda (according to the
materials for review)?</p>

<p>3. What kinds of activities should be included in the opening
of a meeting?</p>

<p>4. What is the purpose of ground rules for a meeting. How can
they be developed?</p>

<p>5. What are some ideas to ensure that meeting time is managed
as effectively as possible?</p>

<p>6. How can you evaluate the meeting process? How can you evaluate
results of the overall meeting process?</p>

<p>7. What activities are including when closing a meeting?</p>

<p>8. What challenges do you see in implementing the meeting-management
recommendations in the materials for review? What do you dislike
about meetings? What do you like? What are you hearing from others
about the quality of the meetings in your organization? What can
you do to make your meetings more effective?</p>

<h2>Managing and Leading Yourself</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>For assistance in answering the following questions, see
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor262914"
  class="textlink">Managing Yourself</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Why is the role of first-time manager and/or supervisor
so stressful sometimes?</p>

<p>2. How many hours a week are you working now? Is that a problem?
What do those nearest to you think about the number of hours that
you're working? How many hours a week do you think you should
work on average? What is the largest number of hours that you
should work in a week? The number of hours that you work in a
week can be a clear indicator of current or oncoming problems
in your stress level and effectiveness as a manager. What measures
can you take to ensure that you don't get so consumed by your
job that you lose perspective and ultimately lose your overall
effectiveness as a manager? Strongly consider involving someone
else in helping to determine the total number of hours that you
will work in a week.</p>

<p>3. How do you know if you're stressed? What are the signs?
Does anyone else in your life and/or your work know to look for
those signs?</p>

<p>4. How might you recruit a mentor or coach? Think about this
question very seriously. Having a mentor or coach can be the single,
most effective measure you can take to ensure that you manage
yourself and your job in a highly effective manner.</p>

<p>5. What's the difference between matters that are urgent and
those that are important? What should be your approach to handling
each of these two types of issues? What advice is given in the
materials for review regarding these two types of issues?</p>

<h2>Optional Readings -- Broad Contexts of Management and Leadership</h2>

<p>1. Give brief definitions for the following terms (compare
the terms with each other, noting how they are similar and different):
Board of Directors. Executives. Managers. Leaders. Supervisors.
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/terms.htm"
class="textlink">Basics -- Definitions (and Misinterpretations)
in Management</a>.)</p>

<p>2. What does the term &quot;management&quot; mean (include
in your answer, the four major functions of management)? (See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/terms.htm" class="textlink">Basics
-- Definitions (and Misinterpretations) in Management</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Briefly describe each of the following four management functions:
Planning. Organizing. Leading. Coordinating (or controlling) activities.
Of course, these functions are not carried out apart from each
other -- they're highly integrated. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/terms.htm"
class="textlink">Basics -- Definitions (and Misinterpretations)
in Management</a>.)</p>

<p>4. New managers and leaders often struggle to find the one,
best way to manage and lead. Over time, they realize the &quot;best
way&quot; depends very much on the situation, for example, the
life cycle of the organization, the specific nature and needs
of the organization -- and their own nature and needs, as well.
A very basic understanding of theories and styles of management
and leadership can help greatly when finding the &quot;best way&quot;.
Very briefly, what is the contingency theory of management? Systems
theory? Chaos theory? What are some of the major styles of management?
What is the importance of knowing the life cycle of an organization
when leading and managing an organization? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/theories.htm#cont"
class="textlink">Basic Overview of Contemporary Theories in Management</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor283260"

class="textlink">Various Styles of Management</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor148586"
class="textlink">Conventional Traits and Styles</a>.)</p>

<p>5. Many management experts believe that we're coming into a
&quot;new paradigm&quot;. What is this new paradigm? (See <a 
href="http://managementhelp.org/management/paradigms.htm" class="textlink">New
Paradigm in Management</a>)</p>

<p>6. What is the argument that some people put forth to explain
their view that managing and leading are different? What do you
think? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor508177"
class="textlink">Views That Leading is Different Than Managing</a>.)</p>

<p>7. By now, you might consider your own definition of &quot;What
is leading (in an organizational setting)?&quot; Consider in your
answer, setting direction for others and influencing others to
follow that direction. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor293932"
class="textlink">Definitions of Leadership</a>.)</p>

<h2>Learning to Manage and Lead Yourself</h2>

<p>1. Design a personalized stress management plan. In the plan,
include description of:<br />

the number of hours that you want to average in work per week.
<br />
b) How you will ensure that you notice each of the signs.<br />
c) How you will conclude whether you need to make changes in your
work and life styles.<br />
d) Where you will go for help.<br />
e) At least one friend and ask them to check in with you every
two weeks to see how you're doing. You might suggest that they
do the same plan and you can reciprocate by helping them, as well.
<br />
(For additional assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor262914"
class="textlink">Managing Yourself</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor551899"
class="textlink">Leading Yourself.</a>)</p>

<p>2. Consider getting a mentor or a coach. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/mentoring.htm#anchor4294745062"
class="textlink">Getting a Mentor</a> or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm#anchor4294655486"
class="textlink">Hiring a Coach and Getting Coached</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Name at least three sources for networking and/or support
for you, for example, a network of friends, association, club,
etc. Do you feel comfortable turning to these sources when you
need help? If not, contact at least one source that you feel comfortable
approaching when you're, for example, in need of suggestions for
resources, feeling burned out, etc.</p>

<h2>Optional -- Management Development Planning</h2>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"

a box might open, asking you which software application to open
