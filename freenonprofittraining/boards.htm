<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>If you are an incorporated nonprofit, it's very likely that
you have already at least the beginnings of a board of directors.
Theory and law dictate that the board of directors is responsible
to govern your organization. Typically, new boards of directors
in a new organization work hands-on, almost as partners -- or
as a &quot;working board&quot; -- with the chief executive. <b>A
wise CEO will see Board members almost as strategic partners,
rather than as a necessary evil that corporations must have.</b></p>

<p>It's not uncommon, especially for new organizations, to act
as if they are lucky even to have anyone on their board. Wrong!
You deserve -- and should always expect -- to have a very participative
board that, no matter how hands-on they are at first, also attend
to major decisions about the organization. Completion of this
module will ensure that your board has the necessary components,
policies and practices in place from which to develop a healthy
governing board.</p>

<p>Note that you, as a learner in this program, can greatly enhance
the development of your board by continuing to involve board members
in discussions about topics and questions posed by this program.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT THE ORDER OF MODULES (AND SOME DUPLICATION WITH
PREVIOUS MODULE ON ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER): : The modules
about starting an organization and about the role of chief executives
briefly mention certain activities in regard to building a preliminary
board of directors -- there is a little bit of necessary duplication
between these two modules. This module helps the learner to round
out the board of directors and ensure they are fully functioning
for the organization.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Development Committee (or Board Governance Committee) to review
and help guide implementation the information in this learning
module. Major activities and goals from this learning module could
be incorporated in that Committee's <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm"
class="textlink">Sample Committee Work Plan</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT &quot;CORPORATE&quot; NONPROFITS: A nonprofit organization
is wise to file in its state to be a corporation. The vast majority
of nonprofits that get tax-exempt and/or charitable status with
the Internal Revenue Service (in the United States) have corporate
status. So understand that the term &quot;corporate&quot; on this
page refers to nonprofit corporations.</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>Note that the roles of your board and employees will become
  more clear as you complete strategic planning and product planning
  later on in this program.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Specify Your Board's Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<p>1. Clarify what your board will be doing and what your staff will
be doing. Complete the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/board-employee-roles.htm"
class="textlink">Board and Staff Responsibilities -- Test Your
Knowledge</a> according to the wishes of your board. You can compare
your preferences to those suggested in the table at <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/compared-to-staff-roles.htm"
class="textlink">Board and Staff Responsibilities</a>.</p>

<h2>Authorize Up-to-Date Board Policies</h2>

<p>1. Adopt an up-to-date and acceptable set of bylaws. Before
the next meeting, the board chair and CEO should write a memo
that highlights important points from the current bylaws. Or,
they might make marks in the margin of the current bylaws as means
to highlight important points. Include these highlights in the
board packet of information that gets sent to each board member
before the next meeting. Set aside 20 minutes in an upcoming board
meeting to collect feedback about the current bylaws. Consider
board resolutions to make any changes to the bylaws. Once changes
have been made, consider a resolution to formally adopt the bylaws.
(See <a href="http://www.lectlaw.com/forms/f151.htm" class="textlink" target="_blank">Corporate
Bylaws</a>.)</p>

<p>2. What board policies will you need? Draft -- and carefully
enforce -- a policy for board attendance. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/board-attendance-policy.htm"
class="textlink">Board Attendance Policy (Sample)</a>.)</p>

<p>3. What other policies are required by Sarbanes&#8211;Oxley? Role
of Audit Committee? Whistleblower? Document Retention/Destruction?
(See <a href="http://www.independentsector.org/sarbanes_oxley?s=sarbanes%20oxley"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Sarbanes&#8211;Oxley and Implications for Nonprofits</a>.)</p>

<h2>Organizing Your Board Committees (Includes Recommendations)</h2>

<p>1. What board committees should you have? You should have at
least an executive committee that can meet between board meetings,
if necessary. This committee could be comprised of chairs of other
committees and/or officers of the board. To identify other needed
committees, carefully consider the types of major issues that
your organization faces and any strategic goals to be accomplished
over the next year. What is the nature of these goals and issues,
for example, audit, compensation, financial, board development
and personnel? If possible, establish committees for each of the
major types of issues and goals faced by our organization. (NOTE:
See the following recommendations regarding board committees.)
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/committees.htm"
class="textlink">Typical Types of Board Committees</a>.)</p>

<h3>Recommendation: Establish the Following Initial Board Committees</h3>

<p>1. Strongly consider establishing at least the following board
committees. Each of the following committees can help you accomplish
major sections of this Online For-Profit Organization development
program. Each of the following committees should have its own
work plan. The work plan should include goals to accomplish the
major activities specified in the associated sections of this
online program.</p>

<p><i>Strongly Suggested Standing Committees to Have: <br /></i>
a) Executive Committee -- This committee can be comprised
of chairs from other committees and/or officers of the board.
(See <a href="http://www.greatboards.org/pubs/ExecutiveCommitteeUsesAndAbusesBRPAug2009.pdf"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Executive Committee -- Roles, Uses and Abuses</a>.)<br />
b) Board Governance Committee -- This could be done by the executive
committee for now. This committee also could include nominating,
orienting and training new board members. (See <a href="http://www.axi.ca/TCA/sep2004/betterpractices_1.shtml"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Board Governance Committee.</a>)<br />
c) Marketing Committee -- This committee helps to clarify whom
programs can serve, pricing, collaborators, etc., along with getting
the word out about the nonprofit.<br />
d) Finance Committee -- This committee is almost a requirement,
so that board members take a strong role in understanding and
approving finances. <br />
e) Fundraising Committee -- However, not all nonprofits need fundraising.
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/boards-of-directors/2011/01/19/role-of-the-nonprofit-board-fundraising-committee/"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Role of the Nonprofit Fundraising Committee</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Other Standing Committees to Consider:</i><br />
f) Personnel Committee (this committee can help with policies
about volunteers, too)<br />
g) Programs Committee (this can help with clarifying program goals
and outcomes, and educating the board about programs)</p>

<p>Note that you will probably have much clearer idea about what
committees to have when you get done with your strategic planning
in an upcoming module. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/committees.htm"
class="textlink">Description of Typical Committees</a>.)</p>

<p>2. Quickly establish work plans for your committees. As soon
as your board has approved the new organization of committees,
be sure that each committee sets about to develop its own work
plan. Using a work plan is one of the best ways for committees
to stay effective and engaged. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm"
class="textlink">Sample of a Board of Directors Committee Work
Plan</a>.)</p>

<h2>Staff Your Board With Needed Skills</h2>

<p>1. Identify what skills are now needed by your board. Again,
consider the nature of major issues and goals currently faced
by your organization. Also reference the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/recruitment-grid.htm"
class="textlink">Sample Board of Directors Recruitment Grid</a>.
Write down what skills are needed.</p>

<p>2. Develop procedures for recruiting and orienting board members.
Include steps to recruit members, orient members, get completed
applications from board candidates and elect new members. Consider
information in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/recruiting-members.htm"
class="textlink">Guidelines for Recruiting New Board Members</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/orienting-members.htm" class="textlink">Orienting
New Members to Boards of Directors</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/application.htm"
class="textlink">Sample Board Application Form</a>. Have the entire
board review the procedures for acceptance and authorization.</p>

<p>3. Use your new procedures to begin recruiting new board members.
(The size of the board is usually specified in the bylaws. You
can recruit enough members to reach this size. If the size needs
to be changed, consider a resolution to modify the bylaws.)</p>

<h2>Ensure Strong Participation of Board Members (Board Meetings)</h2>

<p>1. Get board packets out to members at least a week before
each meeting. One of the clearest indicators to board members
that the organization is not taking them seriously is if they
don't get materials in time for adequate review before board meetings. Write
a procedure for your staff to always send out a packet of meeting-preparation
information to board members at least one week before the next
board meeting. In the packet, include at least the following:
<br />
a) agenda for the upcoming meeting<br />
b) report from the chief executive about major accomplishments
and current issues and plans over the next two months<br />
c) financial reports, including at least a budget report and cash
flow statement<br />
d) materials that can help board members act on any major decisions
expected from them in the next meeting</p>

<p>2. Expect nothing less than full (or excused) absence from
meetings. What kind of attendance are you getting to current board
meetings? Are you regularly getting at least a quorum of members?
(The quorum is the minimum number of members that must be present
in a meeting for that meeting and its processes to be considered
official. The quorum is usually specified in the bylaws.) If you
are not getting strong attendance, then be sure to enforce a <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/board-attendance-policy.htm" class="textlink">Board
Attendance Policy (Sample)</a>. If you don't enforce this policy,
then you have a <i>major</i> problem -- the problem is that you
aren't taking it seriously to expect and pursue a strong board
of directors.</p>

<p>3. The board's worst enemy -- the &quot;numb out&quot; factor.
One of the first signs that a board is in trouble is when members
have opinions that they don't express during meetings. If you
find yourself sitting in a board meeting and realize you have
&quot;numbed out&quot;, then you're not doing your duty as a board
member. Do you need to follow any of the guidelines in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/activating-committees.htm"
class="textlink">Ideas to Generate Participation in Committees</a>?</p>

<h2>Ensure Your Board and Chief Executive are Really(!) Effective</h2>

<p>1. Establish a procedure for regular board self-evaluations.
Don't just &quot;go through the motions&quot; and not evaluate
whether the board is really effective or not. How does your board
evaluate itself now? Do you have a procedure that has been accepted
and authorized by board members? Is your board evaluating itself
on a regular basis? The board should conduct evaluations on a
yearly basis, or at least every two years. If the board isn't
evaluating itself on a regular basis, then make this point to
discuss in an upcoming meeting. Consider information in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/evaluation.htm"
class="textlink">Board of Directors Self-Evaluation</a> and <a
href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Evaluating the Board of Directors</a>.</p>

<p>2. Establish a procedure  to evaluate the chief executive
on a regular basis -- preferably once a year. Don't just &quot;go
through the motions&quot; and not evaluate whether the chief executive
officer is really effective or not. Does your board evaluate your
chief executive officer? How often? How are the results used?
If you are not evaluating the chief executive on a regular basis,
then why not? Make this a point to discuss in an upcoming meeting.
Consider information in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/evaluating-chief-executive.htm"
class="textlink">Guidelines for Board of Directors Evaluation
of Chief Executive</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/form-to-evaluate-ceo.htm"
class="textlink">Sample Form for Board's Evaluation of the Chief
Executive</a>.</p>

<h2>Clearly Communicate What Your Board Does (Board Operations)</h2>

<p>1. Establish a calendar of the recurring major activities to
be conducted by your board each year. The calendar should be accepted
and authorized by the board. Consider information in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/calendar.htm"
class="textlink">Sample Board Operations Calendar</a>.</p>

<h2>Ensure Adequate Protection from Liabilities</h2>

<p>1. Conclude what insurance you do and don't need for board
members. Is your board aware of any potential liabilities? Should
your board members consider getting any certain forms of insurance?
Consider information in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/lawsandethics/governance-laws.htm"
class="textlink">Legal</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/liabilities/insurance.htm" class="textlink">Insurance Considerations for Board
Members</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessinsurance/liability-insurance.htm"
class="textlink">Overview of Liability Insurance (including Directors'
and Officers' Insurance)</a>.</p>

<h2>Build a Board Manual for Each Board Member</h2>

<p>1. Ensure that each board member has a policies manual that
contains at least the following policies and materials. (See <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/manual.htm" class="textlink">Sample

and bylaws.</p>

<p>j) Copy of your strategic plan (if applicable).</p>

<h2>Train Board Members to Be Highly Effective (Board Training
Session)</h2>

<p>1. Conduct a board training session to ensure each board member
fully understands their role and has the necessary resources to
carry out their role. Review information in the document <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/training-members.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Guidelines and Sample Agenda for Board
Training Session.</a> Now draft a training session agenda that
specifies the topics that will be covered in the session, who
will address each topic and how. Schedule and carry out the training
session.</p>

learning in this program?</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you

you doing about it?</p>

<p>6.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Nonprofit?"</p>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
