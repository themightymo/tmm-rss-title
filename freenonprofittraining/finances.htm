<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Financial management is a major responsibility of the board
and nonprofit chief executive. It's not uncommon for nonprofit
founders and chief executives at first to have very limited skills
in financial management. However, they should quickly develop
at least basic skills in financial management, including in the
critical areas of managing operating and program budgets, bookkeeping,
financial controls, cash management, financial statement generation
and analysis. This module will help you understand those critical
areas of financial management, and build the basic systems and
practices needed in a healthy nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>The board has final responsibility for the financial health
of the nonprofit organization. Therefore, it's critical that new
nonprofits quickly build up the roles of the treasurer and finance
committee. The treasurer and finance committee can be wonderful
assets to the chief executive when managing the finances of the
organization -- however, the board members and chief executive
should never completely ignore the finances by leaving them for
the treasurer and other board members to manage. The board's role
in ongoing governance of the nonprofit finances can include ongoing
review of financial reports during board meetings, approving yearly
budgets and financial statements, approving a set of fiscal policies
(guidelines for managing the nonprofit's finances), reviewing
results of a yearly audit conducted by an outside auditor, co-signing
checks that are over certain limits and approving contracts.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT LEARNING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: At first, when learning
financial management, many people might react that the learning
experience seems mostly like filling one's head with strange concepts
and processes. Typically, the learning process starts with this
experience -- it probably isn't until the learner actually enters
an accounting transaction and analyzes a financial statement that
learning about financial management seems more &quot;real&quot;.
But the learning process almost always starts by reviewing concepts
and processes. Financial management almost always tells the truth
about the situation of a nonprofit -- so the learning process
is well worth the effort.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Finance Committee to review and help guide implementation the
information in this learning module. Major activities and goals
from this learning module could be incorporated in that Committee's
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm" class="textlink">Committee
Work Plan</a>.</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and staff, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Role of Treasurer and Board Finance Committee</h2>

<p>1. One of the greatest assets to a chief executive can be the
board treasurer and finance committee. Do you have a board treasurer
and a finance committee? If not, make it a high priority to recruit
a treasurer and organize a board finance committee. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/index.htm#anchor1824619"
class="textlink">Your Board Treasurer -- A Critical Resource to
Help You Get Started</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/Board-Finance-Committee.pdf"
class="textlink">Charter and Work Plan for Board Finance Committee</a>.)</p>

<h2>Bookkeeping and Financial Controls</h2>

<p>1. Select the journals with which you will be working. If you
are a small nonprofit that is just starting out, then you'll likely
only need a cash journal. (See and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Overview of U.S. Nonprofit Financial Management</a>.)</p>

<p>2. Will you be using a cash-basis or accrual-basis accounting?
If you're a small nonprofit, then you're likely to use the cash-basis
to record transactions and an accrual-basis for generating your
financial statement. (See and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Overview of U.S. Nonprofit Financial Management</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Devise a Chart of Accounts. (See <a href="http://nccs.urban.org/projects/ucoa.cfm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Unified Chart of Accounts.</a>)</p>

<p>4. Adopt a preliminary set of financial internal controls.
Consider practices about signing checks, opening mail, verifying
that account totals are accurate, etc.) (See <a href="http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/NAMI_Center_for_Excellence/Tools_for_Excellence/NAMIAccountingManual.pdf"
class="textlink" target="_blank">Sample Financial Procedures Manual</a>.)</p>

<h2>Designing an Operating (Annual or Yearly) Budget</h2>

<p>1. Your operating budget depicts the revenue the nonprofit
expects to earn or be granted, and the expenses it expects to
incur. It also depicts how that revenue will be spent. Budget
development starts from strategic planning. If you completed <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/strategic-planning.htm"
class="textlink">Module 6: Developing Your Strategic Plan</a>.
then you already have designed a basic yearly operating budget.
If you completed <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/marketing.htm"
class="textlink">Module 7: Designing and Marketing Your Programs,</a>
then you've updated your operating budget to include functional
budgets for each of your programs. If you have not completed these
two modules, you should review information and materials in those
modules to draft a basic operating budget and associated functional
budgets for each of your programs.</p>

<p>2. Obtain authorization of the operating budget (including
functional budgets for each program) by the board. Board members
should receive copies of the operating budget for their review
and authorization in a board meeting. The minutes of the board
meeting should reflect members' approval of the budget. Approval
indicates that the board expects the nonprofit to operate over
the coming year according to the expected expenses and revenues
depicted in the approved operating budget. Note that if board
members have been involved in previous strategic and program planning,
then their approval of the budgets should be very straightforward
at this point.</p>

<h2>Managing Program Finances</h2>

<p>1. If you finished the learning modules about strategic planning
and about program design and marketing, then you probably already
have a good sense for the revenue and expenses of each of your
programs. If you have not done so, write a basic functional or
program budget. The board should review and authorize this budget.
(See <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4493785_make-budget-nonprofit-organization.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How Do We Prepare a Budget?.</a>)</p>

<h2>Financial Statements, Analysis and Reporting</h2>

<p>1. At this point, you're ready to generate a basic Statement
of Financial Position, Statement of Activities and Statement of
Cash Flows. The board should review and authorize these statements.</p>

<p>2. Attempt a basic analysis of these statements and write the
conclusions and recommendations from this analysis. The board
should review the conclusions and recommendations. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/index.htm#anchor1733946"
class="textlink">Financial Analysis.</a>)</p>

<h2>Nonprofit Taxation</h2>

<p>1. Have you obtained &quot;tax-exempt&quot; status from the
IRS? If so, be sure to keep the master copy of the letter safely
stored away. What taxes are you exempt from? (See <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D96590%2C00.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Frequently Asked Questions About
Applying for Tax Exemption.</a>)</p>

<p>2. Attempt to fill in a Form 990? What information do you need
to complete and file the form? When do you have to file the form?
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/taxes/nonprofit-taxes.htm#anchor4293567821"
class="textlink">Preparing and Filing Form 990s (including about
public disclosure)</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Will you have any unrelated business income? What is the
source of this income? How will you report it? (See <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D96104%2C00.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Unrelated Business Income.)</a></p>

<p>4. Does (or will) your nonprofit engage in lobbying can a 501(c)(3)?
How much? Will that be a problem? (See <a href="http://www.njnonprofits.org/NPsCanLobby.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Non-Profit Organizations CAN

<h2>Develop Your Fiscal Policies Manual</h2>

<p>1. Now that you've considered all of the aspects of financial
and tax management for your nonprofit, you're ready to compile
a set of policies to ensure that finances and taxes continue to
be managed effectively. Work with the Finance Committee to write
an outline of the content of a fiscal policies manual. The Committee
should adopt an action plan to develop and authorize the necessary
policies for the manual. The manual should be reviewed and authorized
on a yearly basis. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Overview of U.S. Nonprofit Financial Management.</a>
and <a href="http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/NAMI_Center_for_Excellence/Tools_for_Excellence/NAMIAccountingManual.pdf"

<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>1. Conduct a detailed audit of your financial management practices
and internal controls by answering the questions about &quot;Financial
Indicators&quot; in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/index.htm"
class="textlink">Checklist of Nonprofit Indicators</a>. List an
action plan to complete items suggested by the audit, but not
done by your organization.</p>

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<h3>Reminders About You</h3>

<p>1. Are you using your skills learned in previous modules? For
example, as you using methodical approaches to problem solving
and decision making? Are you using strong practices of meeting
management? Are you communicating key information to others throughout
your organization?</p>

<p>2. Are you discussing topics and materials with peers, board
members and others, as appropriate? Discussion and ongoing feedback
are some of the best methods to really learn new information and
materials.</p>

<p>3. Are you helping others to hold you accountable to your times
that you committed to reading and study in this program?</p>

<p>4.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Nonprofit?"</p>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
