<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Raising funds to operate your organization and its programs
is very likely one of the most important activities for your nonprofit.
Many nonprofits obtain necessary monies from fees and sales (that
is, from sources other than donations). However, if your nonprofit
counts on donations, then this module will be very useful to you.</p>

<p>This module will guide you through basic considerations and
activities that address the questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is fundraising?</li>
  <li>Are you ready for fundraising?</li>
  <li>What are the standard sources and how are they approached?</li>
  <li>What's the board's role in fundraising?</li>
  <li>How is a proposal written?</li>
  <li>How can fundraising software help me?</li>
  <li>Should you use a fundraiser and/or grantwriter?</li>
  <li>How can the Internet and Web help you with your fundraising?</li>
  <li>How is the overall health of your nonprofit's fundraising
  activities?</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE ABOUT PERSPECTIVES: As you'll soon notice, there are many,
major different aspects of nonprofit fundraising. There also are
many specialists in most of the aspects. Thus, it's not uncommon
that there are very diverse, strong opinions about how fundraising
should be done. This module aims to convey the basics and many
of the &quot;best practices&quot; in fundraising. Many consultants
might have different opinions about some of the perspectives in
this module, but most would probably agree with most of the perspectives
in this module.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Fundraising Committee to review and guide implementation of key
information in this learning module. Major activities and goals
from this learning module could be incorporated in that Committee's
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm" class="textlink">Committee
Work Plan</a>.</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and staff, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
  <li><i>Write down your answers to the following questions --
  those answers can be compiled into your Fundraising Plan.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Fundraising Preparation</h2>

<p>1. Is your organization really ready for fundraising? How do
you know?</p>

<p>2. How will the Board be involved? Remember that Board members
should be very involved -- it's not just the CEO's job to raise
funds.</p>

<p>3. What will be the role of the Fundraising Committee?</p>

<p>4. Who else will be involved and how?</p>

<h2>2. What Are Your Fundraising Goals? How Much Should You Ask
For? By When?</h2>

<p>1. How much money will your organization ask for? Is it for
operating costs or a capital campaign? How did you determine this
amount?</p>

<p>2. How much will go to programs, that is, to directly serving
clients? How much will go to indirect costs, that is, to administrative
overhead?</p>

<p>3. How much will the fundraising activities cost, for example,
office supplies, if you hire a fundraising consultant, etc.?</p>

<p>4. By when will you need the money?</p>

<h2>3. What Sources Will You Approach? How? When? Who Will Approach
Them?</h2>

<p>1. What specific funders will you approach and how? Among individuals?
Foundations? Corporations? Government?</p>

<p>2. Who will approach each source? It should not just be the
CEO who always takes the lead. Perhaps the Board members need
to be trained about fundraising -- who will do that training?</p>

<p>3. How will you approach each source? Remember that each might
prefer to be approached differently -- see their guidelines for
solicitation. Also remember that startup nonprofits rarely receive
grants -- they usually get funding from individuals.</p>

<p>4. When will each source be approached?</p>

<h2>4. Should You Hire a Fundraiser -- and If So</h2>

<p>1. Should you hire a fundraiser? If so, then why? If not, they
why not?</p>

<p>2. If you decide to approach a fundraiser, what might he/she
want to know about your organization?</p>

<p>3. If you hire a fundraiser, how should they be paid? How do
you know?</p>

<h2>5. How Will You Monitor That Donor Requirements Are Being
Met?</h2>

<p>1. Major funders, such as foundations and corporations and
the government, will want reports about the status of meeting
their requirements. How will you ensure those requirements are
being met?</p>

<p>2. Who will provide regular reports to the donors?</p>

<p>3. Who will provide donor recognition letters or other forms
of communication?</p>

<h2>6. Fundraising Software</h2>

<p>1. What software might you need to better manage your fundraising
efforts? What must you consider when getting this software?</p>

<h2>7. Draft Your Fundraising Plan</h2>

<p>1. By now, you have already developed the basic components
of a broad fundraising plan. You can compile your plan by collecting
your answers to the above questions.</p>

<p>2. Obtain board approval of your fundraising plan. (If you
have been working with a board committee to answer the questions
and conduct the activities suggested in this module, then board
approval should be fairly straightforward at this point.)</p>

<br />

<a name="anchor694935"></a>
<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>1. Answer the questions about &quot;Fundraising Indicators&quot;
in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/index.htm"
class="textlink">Checklist of Nonprofit Organizational Indicators</a>.
List an action plan to complete items suggested by the audit,
but not done by your organization.</p>

<p>2. Also see <a href="http://www.raise-funds.com/1999/campaign-assessment-and-review-what-was-accomplished-and-what-was-learned/"

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<p>1. Are you exchanging feedback with others about what you're
learning in this program?</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you
working? Are you noticing any signs of stress? If so, what are
you doing about it?</p>

<p>6. One of the ways you might be able to tell if you're stressed
out and/or losing perspective might be whether you're tracking
details or not. Are you using the action item list referenced
above?</p>

<p>7.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Nonprofit?"</p>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
