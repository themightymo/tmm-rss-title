<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Nonprofits deliver their services to the their communities
in the form of <b>programs</b>. There is a common misconception
that a program is the activities of delivering services -- but
that's not correct. A program is</p>

<ul>
  <li>a highly integrated set of activities</li>
  <li>that aims to meet a verified, unmet need in the community</li>
  <li>by accomplishing certain outcomes</li>
  <li>among certain groups clients and</li>
  <li>by evaluating that those outcomes are being achieved among
  those clients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the design of a program should include verifying that
there indeed is an unmet need in the community. That has to include
more than the passionate assertions of the founders of the nonprofit
-- it has to include objective, verifiable evidence of the unmet
need. The design should include verifying what outcomes need to
be achieved, including what new knowledge, skills and abilities
among the clients to be served. Program evaluation should regularly
be conducted to verify that those outcomes are being achieved.</p>

<p>The activities of <b>program evaluation</b> can include a wide
variety of methods to evaluate many aspects of programs in nonprofits.
As with any evaluation activity, the type of evaluation used,
depends on what the organization wants to be able to do as a result
of the evaluation, whether it's, for example, to improve the program's
processes or measure results of the program. There are many types
of program evaluations. For example, a <b>goals-based evaluation</b>
examines if the goals of a program were achieved or not. A <b>process
evaluation</b> examines the strengths and weaknesses of the program's
processes. An <b>outcomes-evaluation</b> examines what outcomes
were achieved and the extent to which desired outcome were achieved.</p>

<p>There are numerous books and other materials that provide in-depth
analysis of evaluations, their designs, methods, combination of
methods and techniques of analysis. However, personnel do not
have to be experts in these topics to carry out a useful program
evaluation. The &quot;20-80&quot; rule applies here, that 20%
of effort generates 80% of the needed results. It's better to
do what might turn outs to be an average effort at evaluation
than to do no evaluation at all because of concerns of not doing
it perfectly. Far too many program evaluations become extended,
scientifically-based, data-driven efforts that generate information
that is either impractical or irrelevant -- if the information
is understood at all. This learning module orients personnel to
the nature of program evaluation and how it can be carried out
in a realistic and practical fashion.</p>

<h2>Writing Your Overall Program Evaluation Plan</h2>

evaluation)<br />

Indicators (Best Practices) (includes program planning and evaluation)</a></p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<p>1. Are you exchanging feedback with others about what you're
learning in this program?</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you
working? Are you noticing any signs of stress? If so, what are
you doing about it?</p>

<p>6. One of the ways you might be able to tell if you're stressed
out and/or losing perspective might be whether you're tracking
details or not. Are you using the action item list referenced
above?</p>

<p>7.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Nonprofit?"</p>


<br />
<hr align="left" />

<a name="anchor695302"></a>
<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization is struggling
is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed. (Open
action items are required actions that have not yet been completed.)
Instead, organization members only see and react to the latest
&quot;fires in the workplace&quot;. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items that includes listing each open action item, who
is responsible to complete it, when it should be completed and
any associated comments. When updating the list, consider action
items as identified during discussions, learning activities and
assessments in this module. Share and regularly review this action
item list with the appropriate board, management and staff members
in your nonprofit. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
