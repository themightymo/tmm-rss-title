<h2>Results for Learners and Their Organizations</h2>

<h3>Personal and Organizational Outcomes (knowledge, skills and
abilities)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Complete and careful deliberation about whether to start
  a nonprofit organization</li>
  <li>Guidance to register new nonprofit organization for incorporation,
  tax-exemption, etc.</li>
  <li>Broad understanding of their nonprofit, including structures,
  systems, culture and life cycle</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of the role of chief executive officer</li>
  <li>Basic skills needed to recruit the first board members and
  work with the new board</li>
  <li>Basic skills in management and leadership in order to plan,
  organize, lead and coordinate activities in their nonprofit</li>
  <li>Basic oversight and governance provided by resourced and
  trained board of directors</li>
  <li>Basic and integrated planning processes for strategic direction,
  program development and marketing and evaluation, financial management,
  fundraising, and staffing and supervision of employees and volunteers</li>
  <li>Substantial cost savings from continued access to free, complete,
  online materials for personal, professional and organizational
  development</li>
  <li>(Outcomes from each module are listed near the top of each
  module.)
</ul>

<h3>Program Outputs (tangible results)</h3>

<p>Learners in the program produce the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Job description of chief executive officer</li>
  <li>Management and leadership training plans</li>
  <li>Complete resources to equip board members</li>
  <li>Training plan and materials to train the board</li>
  <li>Strategic plan</li>

  <li>Public and media relations plan</li>
  <li>Sales plan</li>
  <li>Advertising and promotions plan</li>
  <li>Customer service plan</li>
  <li>Financial report and analysis</li>
  <li>Fundraising plan</li>

<p>Note that the recurring processes that produce the above items
are at least as important -- if not more important -- than the
items themselves. This program carefully guides the learner through
those processes.</p>


<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor53252"></a>

<h2>Nature of Learners Who Will -- and Won't -- Thrive in this
Program</h2>

<h3>Who Will Thrive</h3>

<p>This highly accessible and practical program is particularly
useful for highly motivated learners who:<br />
1. Trust their own ability to manage and carry out their own learning<br />
2. Understand that in learning, you don't always get what you
pay for -- but you get out what you put in<br />
3. Prefer practical results (along with powerful outcomes) from
a program, e.g., results such as plans, policies and procedures,
job descriptions, financial statements, etc. <br />
4. Who cannot afford to pay the rapidly increasing costs of tuition
and materials<br />
5. Who are geographically remote from educational facilities<br />
6. Prefer to schedule and locate their own learning experiences<br />
7. Can see the value of self-directed, &#147;homeschooled&#148;
learning with the support of peers in an atmosphere of trust and
confidentiality<br />
8. Prefer to share ongoing ideas, materials and support among
peers<br />
9. Lastly, learners will thrive in this state-of-the-art program
if they have a sense of adventure about new experiences and the
patience for learning new ways of doing things</p>

<h3>Who Will Not Thrive</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best way to convey the nature of people who won't
thrive in this program is to point out certain myths that many
of us have come to believe over the years. This program will not
be appealing to people who tend to believe (consciously or unconsciously)
that:<br />
1. The prettier the content and materials, the more valid the
content and materials<br />
2. The more expensive the program, the more learning that will
be accomplished (the fallacy of &quot;executive-level pricing&quot;)<br />
3. The more books and binders in the program, the more learning
in the program<br />
4. Program certification and diplomas represent guaranteed learning
that was accomplished by participants in the program <br />
5. Learning occurs primarily in a classroom<br />
6. Educators can always manage learners' learning better than
the learners themselves</p>


<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor1447377"></a>

<h2>Program Design and Format of Learning Modules</h2>

<h3>Arrangement of Modules -- From Building Basics to Complete
Nonprofit Fitness Test</h3>

<p>The program includes 12, online learning modules. Modules are
&quot;courses&quot; through which learners progress in the program.
Materials and activities for learning are tightly integrated with
each other across various modules in the program. A listing of
the learning modules is included in the section <a href="#anchor704607"
class="textlink">Catalog of Learning Modules</a> provided near
the end of this program description. The section <a href="#anchor660058"
class="textlink">Links to Learning Modules</a> directs learners
through the learning modules in the order depicted in the catalog.
Note that learners can choose to complete modules according to
their own needs, as well.</p>

<h3>Learners Can Start Anywhere in the Program</h3>

<p>The program can be highly useful to learners regardless of
the order in which they go through the modules in the program.
Learning modules are arranged <i>generally</i> in the order needed
to develop an organization from the ground up. Learners who are
going through the program primarily as a form of training and
development can proceed in a sequential fashion through the <a
href="#anchor660058" class="textlink">Links to Learning Modules</a>,
and address the a) topics for discussion and reflection and the
b) activities to build systems and practices both of which are
posed in each learning module.</p>

<p>Note that the activities required to build and manage a healthy
nonprofit organization are usually very cyclical in nature --
for example, program planning often produces learning that, in
turn, polishes previous strategic planning activities. Therefore,
learners are guided to revisit certain portions of various learning
modules at various points in the program.</p>

<h3>Format of Each Learning Module</h3>

<p>Learning modules (other than the first and last) have the following
format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Introduction</b> -- explains how the module fits into
  the program and the overall process of nonprofit organization
  development</li>
  <li><b>Outcomes</b> -- lists the new knowledge, skills, practices
  and systems that learners will accomplish from completing that
  module</li>
  <li><b>Specific Materials for Review</b> -- references specific
  and free materials needed to respond to all suggested topics
  for discussion and reflection and to the learning activities
  to build basic systems and practices</li>
  <li><b>Specific Topics and Questions for Reflection and Discussion</b>
  -- highlights key concepts to understand about the overall topic
  of the learning module</li>
  <li><b>Specific Activities to Build Systems and Practices</b>
  -- guides the learner to develop the basic systems and practices
  to successfully build and manage the nonprofit</li>
  <li><b>Assessments</b> -- helps the learner measure and / or
  evaluate extent of application of that topic to the learner's
  nonprofit</li>
  <li><b>Tracking Open Action Items</b> -- guides the learner throughout
  the program to consistently record and track any incomplete action
  items remaining from the current and previous learning modules</li>
  <li><b>Reminders to Learners</b> -- some of the modules pose
  miscellaneous reminders for learners to ensure they're using
  information and skills from previous learning modules</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost of Program and Time to Complete It</h2>

<h3>Program Costs</h3>

<p>The cost of the program depends very much on how the learner
chooses to go through the program. If the learner chooses to go
through the program on their own (rather than, for example, as
part of a group of learners sponsored by a local service provider),
the program is entirely free. Otherwise, program costs are determined
by the local service provider who sponsors the program.</p>

<h3>Time to Complete Program</h3>

<p>Learners can go through all of the modules in the program or
they can choose their own set of modules and how those modules
will be completed. Consequently, the amount of time to complete
the program depends very much on how the learner chooses to go
through the program. The more time and energy that learners invest
in the program, the more they will learn and accomplish for their
organizations and careers.</p>

<p>Many of the learning activities in this program are activities
that organizational leaders and managers should do in the workplace
anyway to develop a healthy organization. Consequently, time in
the program to conduct these learning activities should not be
viewed only as &quot;time in the program&quot;; rather, this program
helps learners turn their organizations and careers into &quot;learning
labs&quot; where they get things done -- and learn at the same
time.</p>

<p>As a very rough estimate, learners can spend anywhere from
10-40 hours in each module -- again this amount of time depends
very much on how thorough learners are in reviewing learning materials
and conducting activities to deepen and enrich that learning.</p>

<p>Certain modules include more learning activities than others.
Therefore, the program sponsor and learners may choose to dedicate
more than one meeting for these modules. For more information,

<h2>Providing the Program Requires Little in Resources and Expertise!</h2>

<p>Providing the program in your area requires little in resources
and expertise. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/how-to-provide.htm"

<h2>Program Not to Be Used Primarily to Generate Profits</h2>

<p>This program was developed on a pro bono basis as a service
to the nonprofit community. The study materials for the program
are contained in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/"
class="textlink">Free Management Library</a>, also developed as
a pro bono service. Because of the pro bono nature of the program
and its resources, the program should <b>not</b> be used primarily
to generate profits. <i>Specifically, any fees to learners to
participate in this program should be no more than the very low
costs incurred to provide and operate the program.</i></p>
