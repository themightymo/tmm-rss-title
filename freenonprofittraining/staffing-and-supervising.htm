<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Staffing and supervision are two of the most critical functions
of a manager. Each of the functions include various other activities,
as well.</p>

<p>Basically, staffing is:<br />
a) Deciding what human resources are needed, ideally in terms
of knowledge, skills and abilities regarding specified roles,
jobs and tasks (ideally these roles are determined on the basis
of strategic planning and are defined in terms of competencies
and/or on job descriptions)<br />
b) Recruiting the necessary human resources (sourcing, placing
ads, etc.)<br />
c) Considering outsourcing to hire outside expertise<br />
d) Screening job candidates (interviewing, testing, etc.)<br />
e) Selecting candidates (via job offers)<br />
f) Equipping new hires (via orienting, training, facilities, assignments,
etc.)</p>

<p>Basically, supervising is overseeing the progress and productivity
of direct reports, often by:<br />
a) Mutually setting goals with direct reports<br />
b) Supporting conditions for their motivation<br />
c) Observing performance and giving feedback and other forms of
guidance<br />
d) Conducting regular performance appraisals/reviews<br />
e) Addressing performance problems<br />
f) Ensuring sufficient rewards</p>

<p>The activities of staffing and supervising are very similar
when applied to employees and volunteers. Differences are pointed
out in specific sections of the information below. In both cases
(volunteers and employees), staffing and supervision should be
carried out as part of an overall performance management system.
Staffing and supervising should be carried out according to carefully
designed and approved personnel policies in the workplace.</p>

<p>This module provides materials and guidelines to understand
staffing and supervision, along with setting up basic systems
and processes in the organization in order to carry out activities
in a legal and effective manner.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT THE LARGE SIZE OF THIS MODULE: This module is one
of the largest in the program. Learners who have very limited
time schedules might first &quot;pick and choose&quot; which subtopics
they want to review before they proceed through this module in
its entirety. Learners are encouraged, though, to print out the
entire <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm"
class="textlink">Free Basic Guide to Leadership and Supervision</a>
for reference in the future. (NOTE: The guide is quite large,
so wait up to a minute or so for it to load.)</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Personnel Committee [in the case of corporations!] to review and
help guide implementation the information in this learning module.
Major activities and goals from this learning module could be
incorporated in that Committee's <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm"

<h2>Staffing and Supervision of Volunteers</h2>

<p>In many aspects, staffing and supervision of volunteers is
similar to staffing and supervision of employees. Differences
might be in matters of employee benefits and compensation, career
planning and development, delegation versus work direction, and
reward systems. <br />

titles, qualifications, responsibilities and whom the role reports
to? Dates on the forms?</p>

and have all volunteers reviewed it and signed a form indicating
they'll comply with the policies? Has the board approved the handbook
with its policies?</p>

the policies.</p>

<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>1. Answer the questions about &quot;Human Resource Indicators&quot;
in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/index.htm"
class="textlink">Checklist of Nonprofit Indicators</a>. List an
action plan to complete items suggested by the audit, but not
done by your organization.</p>

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<p>1. Are you exchanging feedback with others about what you're
learning in this program?</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you
working? Are you noticing any signs of stress? If so, what are
you doing about it?</p>

<p>6. One of the ways you might be able to tell if you're stressed
out and/or losing perspective might be whether you're tracking
details or not. Are you using the action item list referenced
above?</p>

<p>7. Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how
they build on the learning in this module? For example, are you
seeing your organization from a systems view, as explained in
the module &quot;Starting and Understanding Your Nonprofit?&quot;</p>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
