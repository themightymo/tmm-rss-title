<!--[index|Ethics]-->


<p>(Also see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/index.htm">Ethics:
Practical Toolkit for Business</a>).
</p>

<p><i>This document serves as an example
of a code of ethics. As well as having corporate codes, codes
can be geared for specific purposes and be focused on various
relationships. The following code is geared to support the working
relationships among staff at MAP
for Nonprofits.</i>
</p>

<p>These team values guide how we MAP
staff members interact with each other in our workplace. The integrity
of these values rests on how consistently we apply them. We regularly
review and update these values to reflect current priorities in
our workplace.
