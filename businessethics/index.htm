<h2>About Ethics, Principles and Moral Values</h2>
<p>Simply put, ethics involves learning what is right or wrong, and then doing 
  the right thing -- but &quot;the right thing&quot; is not nearly as straightforward 
  as conveyed in a great deal of business ethics literature. Most ethical dilemmas 
  in the workplace are not simply a matter of &quot;Should Bob steal from Jack?&quot; 
  or &quot;Should Jack lie to his boss?&quot;</p>
<p>(Many ethicists assert there's always a right thing to do based on moral principle, 
  and others believe the right thing to do depends on the situation -- ultimately 
  it's up to the individual.) Many philosophers consider ethics to be the &quot;science 
  of conduct.&quot; Twin Cities consultants Doug Wallace and John Pekel (of the 
  Twin Cities-based Fulcrum Group; 651-714-9033; e-mail at jonpekel@atti.com) 
  explain that ethics includes the fundamental ground rules by which we live our 
  lives. Philosophers have been discussing ethics for at least 2500 years, since 
  the time of Socrates and Plato. Many ethicists consider emerging ethical beliefs 
  to be &quot;state of the art&quot; legal matters, i.e., what becomes an ethical 
  guideline today is often translated to a law, regulation or rule tomorrow. Values 
  which guide how we ought to behave are considered moral values, e.g., values 
  such as respect, honesty, fairness, responsibility, etc. Statements around how 
  these values are applied are sometimes called moral or ethical principles. (Extracted

<h2>What is Business Ethics?</h2>
<p>The concept has come to mean various things to various people, but generally 
  it's coming to know what it right or wrong in the workplace and doing what's 
  right -- this is in regard to effects of products/services and in relationships 
  with stakeholders. Wallace and Pekel explain that attention to business ethics 
  is critical during times of fundamental change -- times much like those faced 
  now by businesses, both nonprofit or for-profit. In times of fundamental change, 
  values that were previously taken for granted are now strongly questioned. Many 
  of these values are no longer followed. Consequently, there is no clear moral 
  compass to guide leaders through complex dilemmas about what is right or wrong. 
  Attention to ethics in the workplace sensitizes leaders and staff to how they 
  should act. Perhaps most important, attention to ethics in the workplaces helps 
  ensure that when leaders and managers are struggling in times of crises and 
  confusion, they retain a strong moral compass. However, attention to business 
  ethics provides numerous other benefits, as well (these benefits are listed 
  later in this document).</p>
<p>Note that many people react that business ethics, with its continuing attention 
  to &quot;doing the right thing,&quot; only asserts the obvious (&quot;be good,&quot; 
  &quot;don't lie,&quot; etc.), and so these people don't take business ethics 
  seriously. For many of us, these principles of the obvious can go right out 
  the door during times of stress. Consequently, business ethics can be strong 
  preventative medicine. Anyway, there are many other benefits of managing ethics 
  in the workplace. These benefits are explained later in this document. (Extracted

<h2>Managing Ethics in the Workplace</h2>

<a name="anchor4413"></a>
<h3>Managing Ethics Programs in the Workplace</h3>
<p>Organizations can manage ethics in their workplaces by establishing an ethics 
  management program. Brian Schrag, Executive Secretary of the Association for 
  Practical and Professional Ethics, clarifies. &quot;Typically, ethics programs 
  convey corporate values, often using codes and policies to guide decisions and 
  behavior, and can include extensive training and evaluating, depending on the 
  organization. They provide guidance in ethical dilemmas.&quot; Rarely are two 
  programs alike.</p>
<p>&quot;All organizations have ethics programs, but most do not know that they 
  do,&quot; wrote business ethics professor Stephen Brenner in the Journal of 
  Business Ethics (1992, V11, pp. 391-399). &quot;A corporate ethics program is 
  made up of values, policies and activities which impact the propriety of organization 
  behaviors.&quot;</p>
<p>Bob Dunn, President and CEO of San Francisco-based Business for Social Responsibility, 
  adds: &quot;Balancing competing values and reconciling them is a basic purpose 
  of an ethics management program. Business people need more practical tools and 
  information to understand their values and how to manage them.&quot; (Extracted

<h3>Developing Codes of Ethics</h3>
<p>According to Wallace, &quot;A credo generally describes the highest values 
  to which the company aspires to operate. It contains the `thou shalts.' A code 
  of ethics specifies the ethical rules of operation. It's the `thou shalt nots.&quot; 
  In the latter 1980s, The Conference Board, a leading business membership organization, 
  found that 76% of corporations surveyed had codes of ethics.</p>
<p>Some business ethicists disagree that codes have any value. Usually they explain 
  that too much focus is put on the codes themselves, and that codes themselves 
  are not influential in managing ethics in the workplace. Many ethicists note 
  that it's the developing and continuing dialogue around the code's values that 
  is most important. (Extracted from <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm">Complete

<a name="anchor12201"></a>
<h3>Developing Codes of Conduct</h3>
<p>If your organization is quite large, e.g., includes several large programs 
  or departments, you may want to develop an overall corporate code of ethics 
  and then a separate code to guide each of your programs or departments. Codes 
  should not be developed out of the Human Resource or Legal departments alone, 
  as is too often done. Codes are insufficient if intended only to ensure that 
  policies are legal. All staff must see the ethics program being driven by top 
  management. <br />
  <br />
  Note that codes of ethics and codes of conduct may be the same in some organizations, 
  depending on the organization's culture and operations and on the ultimate level 
  of specificity in the code(s). (Extracted from <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/ethics-guide.htm">Complete

<h3>Resolving Ethical Dilemmas and Making Ethical Decisions</h3>
<p>Perhaps too often, business ethics is portrayed as a matter of resolving conflicts 
  in which one option appears to be the clear choice. For example, case studies 
  are often presented in which an employee is faced with whether or not to lie, 
  steal, cheat, abuse another, break terms of a contract, etc. However, ethical 
  dilemmas faced by managers are often more real-to-life and highly complex with 
  no clear guidelines, whether in law or often in religion. <br />
  <br />
  As noted earlier in this document, Doug Wallace, Twin Cities-based consultant, 
  explains that one knows when they have a significant ethical conflict when there 
  is presence of a) significant value conflicts among differing interests, b) 
  real alternatives that are equality justifiable, and c) significant consequences 
  on &quot;stakeholders&quot; in the situation. An ethical dilemma exists when 
  one is faced with having to make a choice among these alternatives.</p>

<h2>Assessing and Cultivating Ethical
Culture</h2>

<p>Culture is comprised of the values, norms, folkways and behaviors
of an organization. Ethics is about moral values, or values regarding
right and wrong. Therefore, cultural assessments can be extremely
valuable when assessing the moral values in an organization.</p>

<h2>Ethics Training</h2>
<p>The ethics program is essentially useless unless all staff members are trained 
  about what it is, how it works and their roles in it. The nature of the system 
  may invite suspicion if not handled openly and honestly. In addition, no matter 
  how fair and up-to-date is a set of policies, the legal system will often interpret 
  employee behavior (rather than written policies) as de facto policy. Therefore, 
  all staff must be aware of and act in full accordance with policies and procedures 
  (this is true, whether policies and procedures are for ethics programs or personnel 
  management). This full accordance requires training about policies and procedures.</p>

<h2>Social Responsibility</h2>

<p>Social responsibility and business ethics are often regarding
as the same concepts. However, the social responsibility movement
is but one aspect of the overall discipline of business ethics.
The social responsibility movement arose particularly during the
1960s with increased public consciousness about the role of business
in helping to cultivate and maintain highly ethical practices
in society and particularly in the natural environment. <br />
