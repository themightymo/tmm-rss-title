<p>Note that many methods intended for addressing conflict in groups also might 
  be considered as methods to address conflict between two people. Therefore, 
  also see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/interpersonal/conflict.htm">Addressing 
  Interpersonal Conflict.</a> Also note that the reader might best be served to 
  first read the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/dynamics-theories.htm">Group 
  Dynamics</a> to understand the basic nature of most groups and their typical 
  stages of development. (It's not clear at this time if online groups have similar 
  nature and stages.)</p>

<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Manage Group Conflict</h2>

  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>If there seems to be prolonged conflict among several members of a group, then 
  consider the following guidelines. </p>
<h4>1. First, verify if members indeed are in conflict. Ask the members. Listen 
  for 3 minutes.</h4>
<p>They might not be in destructive conflict, at all. Robust groups might have 
  conflict if members feel comfortable with sharing their views. Conflict is destructive 
  if there is ongoing disagreements, name calling and people are getting upset. 
  So, for now, describe what behaviors you are seeing that might indicate destructive 
  conflict. Do not try to &#8220;diagnose&#8221; the causes of those behaviors, 
  just saw what you are seeing or hearing. Acknowledge that conflict is natural 
  in healthy groups, but explain why you suspect that conflict has become destructive. 
</p>
<h4>2. If members are in destructive conflict, then select approaches to resolve 
  conflict. </h4>
<p>Take a 5-minute break. Ask one or two other members (a subgroup) to step aside 
  with you. Ask them to suggest approach(es) to address the conflict, and then 
  read the ideas listed immediately below. Ask them which approach(es) are most 
  likely to move things along.</p>
<h4>3. Use the approaches selected by the subgroup, with the entire group.</h4>
<p>Explain that the approaches were selected by several of you, not by just one 
  person. Ask that members set aside 10-15 minutes on the agenda to try them out. 
  The more the members are in destructive conflict, the more likely they will 
  be willing to try out the approaches. </p>
<h3>Possible Approaches to Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>Depending on the situation and duration of the conflict, there are a variety 
  of approaches that might support resolution of destructive conflict. Here are 
  some possible approaches: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on what members agree on, for instance by posting the mission, vision 
    and/or values statements to remind people of why they are there.</li>
  <li> Ask members, &#8220;If this disagreement continues, where will we be? How 
    will it hurt our organization?</li>
  <li> Have members restate their position. If it will take longer than three 
    minutes, allow opportunities for others to confirm or question for understanding 
    (not disagreement). </li>
  <li>Shift to prioritizing alternatives, rather than excluding all alternatives 
    but one.</li>
  <li> Take a 10-minute break in which each member quietly reflects on what he/she 
    can do to move the group forward. </li>
  <li>Take 5-10 minutes and in pairs of two, each person shares with the other 
    what he/she is confused or irritated about. One person in the pair helps the 
    other to articulate his/her views to the larger group. Then switch roles and 
    repeat the process. </li>
  <li>Propose an &#8220;agree to disagree&#8221; disposition.</li>
  <li> If disagreement or lack of consensus persists around an issue, have a subgroup 
    select options and then report back to the full group.</li>
  <li> Tell stories of successes and failures in how group members operate, including 
    how members got past their differences and reached agreement. </li>
  <li>Call for a vote on a stated question or decision. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="unstuck" id="unstuck"></a>How to Help Group Members Get Unstuck</h2>
<p>Sometimes, even if there is a lot of participation from members and no prolonged 
  conflict, a group might not seem to be making any progress on group activities. 
  Members may simply be stuck, for example, during planning or when needing to 
  make a major decision. Consider a similar general process as when a group seems 
  in prolonged conflict (listed above). You could: </p>
<h4>1. First, verify if members indeed are stuck. Ask the members. Listen for 
  3 minutes.</h4>
<p>They might not be stuck, at all. Name or describe what behaviors you are seeing 
  that might indicate they are stuck. Do not try to &#8220;diagnose&#8221; causes 
  of those behaviors, just name what you are seeing or hearing. </p>
<h4>2. If members are stuck, then select approaches to move the group forward. 
</h4>
<p>Take a 5-minute break. Ask two other members to step aside with you. Ask them 
  to suggest the approach(es) to move things along, and then read the ideas listed 
  immediately below. Ask them to choose which approach(es) would be most likely 
  to move things along.</p>
<h4>3. Use the approaches, selected by the subgroup, with the entire group.</h4>
<p>Explain that the approaches were selected by several of you, not by just one 
  person. Ask that members set aside 10-15 minutes on the agenda to try them out. 
  The more the members are stuck, the more likely they will be willing to try 
  out the approaches.</p>
<h3>Possible Approaches to Get Unstuck</h3>
<p>Depending on the situation, there are a wide variety of actions that might 
  be helpful in moving the group forward. Possible approaches that members can 
  use to become unstuck include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask the group, &#8220;If we continue to be stuck, where will we be? How 
    will we be hurting our organization?&#8221;</li>
  <li> Take a five-minute break to let members do whatever they want.</li>
  <li> Resort to some movement and stretching.</li>
  <li> Ask for five examples of &#8220;out of the box&#8221; thinking.</li>
  <li> Resort to thinking and talking about activities in which resources do not 
    matter.</li>
  <li> Play a quick game that stimulates creative thinking.</li>
  <li> Use metaphors, such as stories, myths or archetypal images. For example, 
    ask each person to take five minutes to draw or write a metaphor that describes 
    his/her opinions and position in the meeting.</li>
  <li> Have each or some of the planners tell a story and include some humor.</li>
  <li> Use visualization techniques, for example, visualize reading an article 
    about the organization&#8217;s success some years into the future. What does 
    the article say about how the success came about? </li>
  <li>Play reflective or energizing music (depending on the situation).</li>
  <li> Restructure the group to smaller groups or move members around in the large 
    group.</li>
  <li> Have a period of asking question after question after question (without 
    answering necessarily). Repetition of questions, &#8220;why?&#8221; in particular, 
    can help to move planners into deeper levels of reflection and analysis, particularly 
    if they do not have to carefully respond to each question. </li>
  <li>Establish a &#8220;parking lot&#8221; for outstanding or unresolved issues, 
    and then move on to something else. Later, go back to the stuck issue. </li>
  <li>Turn the problem around by reframing the topic and/or issue. Usually, questions 
    help this reframing happen.</li>
  <li> Ask key questions, for example, &#8220;How can we make it happen? How can 
    we avoid it happening?&#8221; Focus on what the group agrees on, for instance 
    by posting the mission, vision and/or values statements to remind people of 
    why they are there.</li>
</ul>
