<h1>UNDERSTANDING FACILITATION</h1>

<a name="anchor236006"></a>
<h2>What is Facilitation?</h2>

<p>Facilitation is the nature of the activities to run a meeting,
including planning, design, implementation and evaluation of the
meeting. The activities can be done in an explicit and systematic
manner or in an implicit, organic and unfolding nature, depending
on the nature and needs of participants. Facilitation can be driven
by an external role that is dedicated to facilitation (a facilitator)
or by the group members themselves.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/facilitation/" target="_blank">What
is facilitation? (and Core Values of Facilitation)</a></p>

<a name="anchor16072"></a>
<h2>What Does a Facilitator Do?</h2>

<p>Simply put, the role of the facilitator (in the context of
personal, professional and organizational development) is to guide
and support a group to get clear on the results they want to accomplish
and what methods they might use accomplish those results. The
facilitator might also guide and support the group to actually
implement those methods, and even evaluate the implementation
and results. The results and methods and the nature of how the
facilitator works with group members depend on the situation.
For example, the facilitator might work in a rather direct role,
making prominent suggestions of what the group should do and how
to do it. Or, the facilitator might work in a more indirect role
by gently noting what the group might do and how to do it. The
following resources give more detailed descriptions of facilitation,
including suggesting various roles that facilitators might play.</p>

<h1>FACILITATION AS A SERVICE</h1>

<a name="anchor227484"></a>
<h2>How Do You Recognize a High-Quality
Facilitator?</h2>

<p>Facilitation is usually not an activity that follows a standardized,
specific procedure. So it's not an activity that many people can
quickly ascertain as being done well or not. However, like many
services that work to guide and support others toward improvement,
there usually is a set of knowledge and skills that most people
agree is necessary to be highly competent. The following links
suggest certain expertise, and an upcoming section provides a
more detailed list.</p>

<h1>CORE SKILLS OF A FACILITATOR</h1>

<p>Whatever one's beliefs about the best nature of facilitation,
the practice usually is best carried out by someone who has strong
knowledge and skills regarding group dynamics and processes --
these are often referred to as process skills. Effective facilitation
might also involve strong knowledge and skills about the particular
topic or content that the group is addressing in order to reach
its goals -- these are often referred to as content skills. The
argument about how much &quot;process versus content&quot; skills
are required by facilitators in certain applications is a very
constructive argument that has gone on for years. The following
skills are important for facilitators regardless of the type of
group or application (groups and applications are listed next
in this topic).</p>

<a name="anchor260202"></a>
<h2>Core Interpersonal Skills for Facilitators</h2>

<p>Although facilitators work primarily with groups, those groups
are comprised of individuals. A good facilitator needs strong
expertise in working with individuals as well as groups. The following
list includes skills that would be very useful for a facilitator
to have.</p>

<h2>Roberts Rules?</h2>

<p>Roberts Rules is comprehensive a set of specific rules by which
members of meetings can conduct their meeting process in a very
orderly fashion, thereby helping to ensure that members get the
most out of meetings. These rules are usually used in very formal
meetings, for example, meetings of Boards of Directors. A facilitator
is not likely to need expertise in the rules unless his/her clients
specifically have adopted them as the procedures to run their
meetings. Facilitators can become highly skilled in the set of
rules and achieve the status of registered Parliamentarians. <br />

<h2>Staying Centered During Facilitation</h2>

<p>It can be quite a challenge for a facilitator to work with
a diverse group of people, sometimes under high-pressure situations,
to get clear on what they want to do and how to do it. A good
facilitator is not easily unsettled -- the facilitator does not
take challenges and conflicts personally. The following links
are to resources that can help the facilitator to stay centered
-- grounded in the type of person that he or she wants to be when
facilitating. Be sure to also review some of the resources in
the earlier topics <a href="#anchor260202" class="textlink">Core
Interpersonal Skills for Facilitators</a> and <a href="#anchor260490"
