<h2><a name="group" id="group"></a>Do Your Gathering a Group or a Team?</h2>

<p>This might seem like a silly question, but it is not. Gatherings of less than 
  10-12 people are considered by organizational development consultants to be 
  a small group. Information in this section is most useful for forming and facilitating 
  small groups of 10-12 people or less. </p>
<p>Groups that are larger than that range tend to have another level of complexity 
  not apparent in small groups. For example, the nature and needs of larger groups 
  are often similar to those of entire ongoing organizations. They have their 
  own various subcultures, distinct subsystems (or cliques), diversity of leadership 
  styles and levels of communication. While certain structures are often useful 
  in small groups, they are absolutely necessary on an ongoing basis in larger 
  groups. For example, larger groups should have a clearly established purpose 
  that is continually communicated, and formal plans and policies about ongoing 
  leadership, decision making, problem solving and communication. </p>
<h2><a name="stages" id="stages"></a>Life Stages of a Team</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>When developing a team, it helps a great deal to have some basic sense of the 
  stages that a typical team moves through when evolving into a high-performing 
  team. Awareness of each stage helps leaders to understand the reasons for members&#8217; 
  behavior during that stage, and to guide members to behavior required to evolve 
  the team into the next stage.</p>
<h3>1. Forming</h3>
<p>Members first get together during this stage. Individually, they are considering 
  questions like, &#8220;What am I here for?&#8221;, &#8220;Who else is here?&#8221; 
  and &#8220;Who am I comfortable with?&#8221; It is important for members to 
  get involved with each other, including introducing themselves to each other. 
  Clear and strong leadership is required from the team leader during this stage 
  to ensure the group members feel the clarity and comfort required to evolve 
  to the next stage. </p>
<h3>2. Storming</h3>
<p>During this stage, members are beginning to voice their individual differences, 
  join with others who share the same beliefs, and jockey for position in the 
  group. Therefore, it is important for members to continue to be highly involved 
  with each other, including to voice any concerns in order to feel represented 
  and understood. The team leader should help members to voice their views, and 
  to achieve consensus (or commonality of views) about their purpose and priorities. 
</p>
<h3>3. Norming</h3>
<p>In this stage, members are beginning to share a common commitment to the purpose 
  of the group, including to its overall goals and how each of the goals can be 
  achieved. The team leader should focus on continuing to clarify the roles of 
  each member, and a clear and workable structure and process for the group to 
  achieve its goals. </p>
<h3>4. Performing</h3>
<p>In this stage, the team is working effectively and efficiently toward achieving 
  its goals. During this stage, the style of leadership becomes more indirect 
  as members take on stronger participation and involvement in the group process. 
  Ideally, the style includes helping members to reflect on their experiences 
  and to learn from them. </p>
<h3>5. Closing and Celebration</h3>
<p>At this stage, it is clear to members and their organization that the team 
  has achieved its goals (or a major milestone along the way toward the goal). 
  It is critical to acknowledge this point in the life of the team, lest members 
  feel unfulfilled and skeptical about future team efforts. </p>

<h2><a name="types" id="types"></a>Some Types of Teams You Could Use</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>There are many types of teams you could use in the workplace. The type you 
  choose depends very much on the nature of the results that the team is to accomplish. 
</p>
<h3>1. Formal and informal teams</h3>
<p>These are usually small groups of employees who come together to address some 
  specific goal or need. Management appoints formal teams, that is, teams that 
  are intentionally organized and resourced to address a specific and important 
  goal or need. Informal teams are usually loosely organized groups of people 
  who come together to address a non-critical, short-term purpose.</p>

<h3>2. Committees</h3>
<p>Committees are organized to address, major ongoing functions or tasks in an 
  organization, and the membership of the committees often is based on the official 
  position of each of the members, for example, committees in Boards of Directors. 
</p>
<h3>3. Problem-solving teams </h3>
<p>These teams are formed to address a particular, major problem currently faced 
  by the organization. Often, their overall goal is to provide a written report 
  that includes recommendations for solving the problem. Membership often is comprised 
  of people who perceive and/or experience the problem, as well as those who can 
  do something about it. </p>
<h3>4. Self-directed and self-managed teams</h3>
<p>These types of teams are increasingly used where a) team members are working 
  to address a complex challenge in a rapidly changing environment, and b) the 
  strong ownership and participation of members are extremely important. These 
  types provide great latitude in how members achieve the overall results to be 
  achieved by the teams. The role of leader in a team might change during the 
  team activities depending on where the team is in its stage of development (see 
  below) and/or achieving is results. <br />
