<h2><a name="guide" id="guide"></a>Guidelines to Conduct Discussion Groups</h2>
<p>Note that the reader might best be served to first read the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/dynamics-theories.htm">Group 
  Dynamics</a> to understand the basic nature of most groups and their typical 
  stages of development. (It's not clear at this time if online groups have similar 
  nature and stages.)</p>
<p>The purpose of the discussion technique is to ensure interaction among group 
  members to identify, clarify, analyze and/or select an item, for example, about:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Issues</li>
  <li> Recommendations</li>
  <li> Objectives</li>
  <li> Responsibilities</li>
  <li> Timelines</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of the discussion technique includes the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Specify the discussion topic and the goal to the planning group (if possible, 
    do this step as pre-work before the next meeting). The goal is usually to 
    identify, clarify, analyze and/or select an item. </li>
  <li>It is often best if the topic is described in the form of a &#8220;yes/no&#8221; 
    question or a choice from among alternatives, for example, &#8220;Should we 
    approve ___?&#8221; or &#8220;Should we hire ____?&#8221;.</li>
  <li> Specify when the discussion is to start and stop.</li>
  <li> Allow for open, unassigned exchange of information, for example, questions, 
    suggestions or general comments until it is time to stop the discussion. Give 
    the group a 2-minute warning when time is almost up.</li>
  <li> Facilitate to focus the discussion around the topic.</li>
  <li> Attempt to capture key points on a flipchart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Optional:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Attempt to summarize the discussion by identifying conclusions or decisions 
    from the discussion. </li>
  <li>The group can make selections from the results using voting (ranking or 
    rating) and/or consensus techniques. </li>
</ul>
