<h2><a name="build" id="build"></a>How to Build Highly Effective Teams</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Too often, teams are formed merely by gathering some people together and then 
  hoping that those people somehow find a way to work together. Teams are most 
  effective when carefully designed. To design, develop and support a highly effective 
  team, use the following guidelines: </p>
<h3>1. Set clear goals for the results to be produced by the team. </h3>
<p>The goals should be designed to be &#8220;SMART.&#8221; This is an acronym 
  for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Specific</li>
  <li>Measurable</li>
  <li>Achievable</li>
  <li>Relevant and </li>
  <li>Time-bound. </li>
</ul>
<p>As much as possible, include input from other members of the organization when 
  designing and wording these goals. Goals might be, for example, &#8220;to produce 
  a project report that includes a project plan, schedule and budget to develop 
  and test a complete employee performance management system within the next year.&#8221; 
  Write these goals down for eventual communication to and discussion with all 
  team members. </p>
<h3>2. Set clear objectives for measuring the ongoing effectiveness of the team. 
</h3>
<p>The objectives, that together achieve the overall goals, should also be designed 
  to be &#8220;SMART.&#8221; Objectives might be, for example, to a) to produce 
  a draft of a project report during the first four weeks of team activities, 
  and b) achieve Board-approval of the proposed performance management system 
  during the next four weeks. Also, write these objectives down for eventual communication 
  to and discussion with all team members. </p>
<h3>3. Define a mechanism for clear and consistent communications among team members.</h3>
<p>New leaders often assume that all group members know what the leaders know. 
  Consistent communication is the most important trait of a successful group. 
  Without communication, none of the other traits can occur. Successful groups 
  even over-communicate, such that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>All members regularly receive and understand similar information about the 
    group, for example, about the group&#8217;s purpose, membership, status and 
    accomplishments.</li>
  <li> These communications might be delivered through regular newsletters, status 
    reports, meetings, emails and collaboration tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Define a procedure for members to make decisions and solve problems.</h3>
<p>Successful groups regularly encounter situations where they must make decisions 
  and solve problems in a highly effective manner. Too often, the group resorts 
  to extended discussion until members become tired and frustrated and eventually 
  just opt for any action at all, or they count on the same person who seems to 
  voice the strongest opinions. Instead, successful groups: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Document a procedure whereby the group can make decisions and ensure that 
    all members are aware of the procedure.</li>
  <li> The procedure might specify that decisions are made, first by aiming for 
    consensus within a certain time frame and if consensus is not achieved, then 
    the group resorts to a majority vote. </li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Develop staffing procedures (recruiting, training, organizing, replacing).</h3>
<p>Too often, group members are asked to join the group and somehow to &#8220;chip 
  in.&#8221; Unfortunately, that approach creates &#8220;chips,&#8221; rather 
  than valuable group members. Instead, if group members go through a somewhat 
  organized, systematic process, then new members often believe that the group 
  is well organized and that their role is very valuable in the group. Successful 
  groups: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify what roles and expertise are needed on the group in order to achieve 
    the group&#8217;s purpose and plans &#8211; they staff according to plans, 
    not personalities.</li>
  <li> New group members go through a systematic process to join the group &#8211; 
    they understand the group&#8217;s purpose, their role, their next steps and 
    where to get help. </li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Determine the membership of the group. </h3>
<p>Consider the extent of expertise needed to achieve the goals, including areas 
  of knowledge and skills. Include at least one person who has skills in facilitation 
  and meeting management. Attempt to include sufficient diversity of values and 
  perspectives to ensure robust ideas and discussion. A critical consideration 
  is availability &#8211; members should have the time to attend every meeting 
  and perform required tasks between meetings. </p>
<h3>7. Determine time frames for starting and terminating the team, if applicable. 
</h3>
<p>Now consider the expertise needed to achieve the goals of the team, and how 
  long it might take to recruit and organize those resources. Write these times 
  down for eventual communication to and discussion with all team members.</p>
<h3>8. Determine the membership of the team. </h3>
<p>What expertise might the team need to achieve the goals of the group? For example, 
  an official authority to gather and allocate resources, or an expert in a certain 
  technology. Always consider if the members will have the time and energy to 
  actively participate in the team. </p>
<h3>9. Assign the role of leader &#8211; to ensure systems and practices are followed.</h3>
<p>The leader focuses on the systems and practices in the team, not on personalities 
  of its members. For example, the leader makes sure that all team members: a) 
  are successfully staffed, b) understand the purpose of the group and their role 
  in it, c) are active toward meeting that purpose and role, and d) utilize procedures 
  for making decisions and solving problems. (Note that the leader does not always 
  have to be a strong, charismatic personality &#8211; while that type of personality 
  can often be very successful at developing teams, it often can create passivity 
  or frustration in other members over time, thereby crippling the group.) </p>
<h3>10. Assign role of communicator &#8211; communication is the life&#8217;s 
  blood of teams!</h3>
<p>Communication is the most important trait of a successful team. It cannot be 
  left to chance. Someone should be designated to ensure that all members receive 
  regular communications about purpose, membership, roles and status. Communications 
  should also be with people outside the team, especially those who make decisions 
  or determine if the team is successful or not. </p>
<h3>11. Identify needs for resources (training, materials, supplies, etc.).</h3>
<p>Start from analysis of the purpose and goals. What is needed to achieve them? 
  For example, members might benefit from a training that provides a brief overview 
  of the typical stages of team development and includes packets of materials 
  about the team&#8217;s goals, structure and process to make decisions. Consider 
  costs, such as trainers, consultants, room rental and office supplies. How will 
  those funds be obtained and maintained?</p>
<h3>12. Identify the costs to provide necessary resources for the team. </h3>
<p>Consider costs, such as paying employees to attend the meeting, trainers, consultants, 
  room rental and office supplies. Develop a budget that itemizes the costs associated 
  with obtaining and supporting each of the resources. Get management approval 
  of the budget.</p>
<h3>13. Contact each team member. </h3>
<p>Before the first meeting, invite each potential team member to be a part of 
  the team. First, send him or her a memo, and then meet with each person individually. 
  Communicate the goals of the project, why the person was selected, the benefit 
  of the goals to the organization, the time frame for the team effort, and who 
  will lead the team (at least initially). Invite the team member to the first 
  meeting. </p>
<h3>14. Early on, plan team building activities to support trust and working relationships.</h3>
<p>Team building activities can include, for example, a retreat in which members 
  introduce themselves, exercises in which members help each other solve a short 
  problem or meet a specific and achievable goal, or an extended period in which 
  members can voice their concerns and frustrations about their team assignments. 
</p>
<h3>15. Carefully plan the first team meeting. </h3>
<p>In the first meeting, review the goals of the team, why each member was selected, 
  the benefit of the goals to the organization, the time frame for the team effort, 
  who will lead the team (at least, initially), when the team might meet and where, 
  and any changes that have occurred since the individual meetings. Have this 
  information written down to hand out to each member. At the end of the meeting, 
  ask each person to make a public commitment to the team effort. </p>
<h3>16. Regularly monitor and report on status of team members toward achieving 
  the goal.</h3>
<p>It is amazing how often a team starts out with a carefully designed plan, but 
  then abandons the plan once the initial implementation of the plan is underway. 
  Sometimes if the plan is behind schedule, team members conclude that the project 
  is not successful. Plans can change &#8211; just change them systematically 
  with new dates and approval of the changes. </p>
<h3>17. Support team meetings and the members&#8217; processes in the team. </h3>
<p>At this point, it is critical that supervisors of team members remain available 
  to provide support and resources as needed. The supervisor should regularly 
  monitor team members&#8217; progress on achieving their goals. Provide ongoing 
  encouragement and visibility to members. One of the most important forms of 
  support a supervisor can provide is coordination with other supervisors to ensure 
  that team members are freed up enough to attend meetings. </p>
<h3>18. Regularly celebrate team members&#8217; accomplishments!</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to avoid burnout is to regularly celebrate accomplishments. 
  Otherwise, members can feel as if they are on treadmill that has no end. Keep 
  your eye on small and recurring successes, not just the gold at the end of the 
  rainbow.</p>

<h2>Team Building - Does Team Building Actually Work?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.freshtracks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Fresh Tracks</a></p>
<p>An article in The Wall Street Journal* suggested that while team building exercises 
  may be fun (for some people), they really don&#8217;t do much to solve workplace 
  issues.<br />
  Team building doesn't just mean getting the team together</p>
<p>Team building doesn't just mean getting the team together</p>
<p>For example, sales executive Paul Garvey claimed that the most insightful team-building 
  exercise he ever participated in involved paintball, which in no way helped 
  to resolve the relationship issues back at the office. Speaking of his former 
  company, he said that colleagues would poach each other&#8217;s deals while 
  their manager played favourites. Someone decided a paintball exercise would 
  help. It didn&#8217;t, and merely reinforced the divisions and favouritism already 
  present.</p>
<p>Another instance of completely inappropriate team building involved the team 
  from a contractor on an Apollo space project. They were asked by their HR department 
  to participate in a role-playing exercise where they had to return safely from 
  the North Pole. Their day-to-day job involved helping astronauts return safely 
  from space. What additional insights into teamwork did HR think this role play 
  could teach them?</p>
<p>The point is that these weren&#8217;t team building programmes at all, rather 
  they were generic activities imposed upon teams without any real consideration 
  for what the team wanted, or needed.</p>
<p>Similarly, while it may be fun and friendly, a corporate fun day involving 
  inflatable suits where you hurl yourself at a Velcro wall, sumo wrestling a 
  colleague, bungee running, quad biking, karting or clay pigeon shooting, won&#8217;t 
  necessarily build team relationships or address any problems in the group. While 
  it may be just the right event for a seasonal celebration, especially if it 
  involves families or partners, this kind of &#8220;team build&#8221; is seen 
  mainly as an informal motivational activity. &#8221;They make us feel good,&#8221; 
  said Margaret Neale, Professor of Organizational behaviour at Stanford&#8217;s 
  Graduate School of Business. &#8220;What they don&#8217;t do is improve team 
  performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>For this, you need a more considered approach and above all, something where 
  the objectives are clearly stated and can be met. You need to take into account 
  specific issues that need to be addressed and the sorts or personalities involved 
  in the team. The resulting programme could well involve a ruthless battle for 
  a trophy in an inflatable Olympics arena, but for a hard-working, hard-playing 
  and highly competitive sales team, perhaps this might be exactly what&#8217;s 
  needed.</p>
<p>For most, however, while it may be fun to get out of the office, you can&#8217;t 
  expect that blasting each other with paint pellets is going to be much of an 
  exercise in resolving trust or communication issues. Perhaps a programme involving 
  something a bit more creative and less physical &#8211; indoors or outdoors 
  &#8211; with plenty of time for discussion is a good place to start. There are 
  always going to be those resistant to the very idea of &#8220;team building&#8221; 
  or others whose comfort zone is very small. Acknowledging this and creating 
  a programme that takes it into account is going to pay far bigger dividends 
  than forcing them to jump out of aeroplanes or role play in Arctic expeditions.</p>
