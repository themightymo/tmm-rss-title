  Appraisals</h1>

  Guide to Leadership and Supervision</a>.</p>
<p> Yearly performance reviews are critical. Organization's are hard pressed to 
  find good reasons why they can't dedicate an hour-long meeting once a year to 
  ensure the mutual needs of the employee and organization are being met. Performance 
  reviews help supervisors feel more honest in their relationships with their 
  subordinates and feel better about themselves in their supervisoral roles. Subordinates 
  are assured clear understanding of what's expected from them, their own personal 
  strengths and areas for development and a solid sense of their relationship 
  with their supervisor. Avoiding performance issues ultimately decreases morale, 
  decreases credibility of management, decreases the organization's overall effectiveness 
  and wastes more of management's time to do what isn't being done properly. Conduct 
  the following activities.</p>
<h3>1. <b>Design a legally valid performance review process</b></h3>
<p>Patricia King, in her book, <i>Performance Planning and Appraisal,</i> states 
  that the law requires that performance appraisals be: job-related and valid; 
  based on a thorough analysis of the job; standardized for all employees; not 
  biased against any race, color, sex, religion, or nationality; and performed 
  by people who have adequate knowledge of the person or job. Be sure to build 
  in the process, a route for recourse if an employee feels he or she has been 
  dealt with unfairly in an appraisal process, e.g., that the employee can go 
  to his or her supervisor's supervisor. The process should be clearly described 
  in a personnel policy.</p>
<h3>2. <b>Design a standard form for performance appraisals</b></h3>
<p>Include the name of the employee, date the performance form was completed, 
  dates specifying the time interval over which the employee is being evaluated, 
  performance dimensions (include responsibilities from the job description, any 
  assigned goals from the strategic plan, along with needed skills, such as communications, 
  administration, etc.), a rating system (e.g., poor, average, good, excellent), 
  space for commentary for each dimension, a final section for overall commentary, 
  a final section for action plans to address improvements, and lines for signatures 
  of the supervisor and employee. Signatures may either specify that the employee 
  accepts the appraisal or has seen it, depending on wording on the form.</p>
<h3>3. <b>Schedule the first performance review for six months after the employee 
  starts employment</b></h3>
<p>Schedule another six months later, and then every year on the employee's anniversary 
  date.</p>
<h3>4. <b>Initiate the performance review process and upcoming meeting</b></h3>
<p>Tell the employee that you're initiating a scheduled performance review. Remind 
  them of what's involved in the process. Schedule a meeting about two weeks out.</p>
<h3>5. <b>Have the employee suggest any updates to the job description and provide 
  written input to the appraisal</b></h3>
<p>Have them record their input concurrent to the your recording theirs. Have 
  them record their input on their own sheets (their feedback will be combined 
  on the official form later on in the process). You and the employee can exchange 
  each of your written feedback in the upcoming review meeting. (Note that by 
  now, employees should have received the job descriptions and goals well in advance 
  of the review, i.e., a year before. The employee should also be familiar with 
  the performance appraisal procedure and form.)</p>
<h3>6. <b>Document your input -- reference the job description and performance 
  goals</b></h3>
<p>Be sure you are familiar with the job requirements and have sufficient contact 
  with the employee to be making valid judgments. Don't comment on the employee's 
  race, sex, religion, nationality, or a handicap or veteran status. Record major 
  accomplishments, exhibited strengths and weaknesses according to the dimensions 
  on the appraisal form, and suggest actions and training or development to improve 
  performance. Use examples of behaviors wherever you can in the appraisal to 
  help avoid counting on hearsay. Always address behaviors, not characteristics 
  of personalities. The best way to follow this guideline is to consider what 
  you saw with your eyes. Be sure to address only the behaviors of that employee, 
  rather than behaviors of other employees.</p>
<h3>7. <b>Hold the performance appraisal meeting</b></h3>
<p>State the meeting's goals of exchanging feedback and coming to action plans, 
  where necessary. In the meeting, let the employee speak first and give their 
  input. Respond with your own input. Then discuss areas where you disagree. Attempt 
  to avoid defensiveness; admitting how you feel at the present time, helps a 
  great deal. Discuss behaviors, not personalities. Avoid final terms such as 
  &quot;always,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; etc. Encourage participation and be supportive. 
  Come to terms on actions, where possible. Try to end the meeting on a positive 
  note.</p>
<h3>8. <b>Update and finalize the performance appraisal form</b></h3>
<p>Add agreed-to commentary on to the form. Note that if the employee wants to 
  add attach written input to the final form, he or she should be able to do so. 
  The supervisor signs the form and asks the employee to sign it. The form and 
  its action plans are reviewed every few months, usually during one-on-one meetings 
  with the employee.</p>
<h3>9. <b>Nothing should be surprising to the employee during the appraisal meeting</b></h3>
<p>Any performance issues should have been addressed as soon as those issues occurred. 
  So nothing should be a surprise to the employee later on in the actual performance 
  appraisal meeting. Surprises will appear to the employee as if the supervisor 
  has not been doing his/her job and/or that the supervisor is not being fair. 
  It is OK to mention the issues in the meeting, but the employee should have 
  heard about them before. </p>
<h2><a name="why" id="why"></a>Why We Hate the Performance Review</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>Most employees in companies today are all too familiar with the concept of 
  the performance review. Just the mention of this often dreaded occurrence of 
  discussion with one&#8217;s supervisor where they get to critique every move 
  you&#8217;ve made during the year while you sit ideally by is sure to send negative 
  feelings throughout the mind&#8217;s of employees everywhere. The performance 
  review generally has a similar effect on managers and supervisors as well. So 
  why is this performance review so dreaded and loathed by many? A few of the 
  reasons are listed below.</p>
<h3>Employees - Why They Hate the Performance Review Process</h3>
<p>They have no control in the situation. Managers get to provide ratings and 
  comments on multiple areas of performance that are most often subjective in 
  nature. If an employee disagrees, they might get a small &#8220;employee comments&#8221; 
  area to provide their rebuttal all the while knowing that if they push too much 
  the person controlling their future still has control. </p>
<p>Reviews sheets are completed before the actual discussion occurs. Therefore 
  bringing up comments has little effect on the actual rating which is most often 
  tied to their annual increase which is usually only a few cents different from 
  the person with the next highest or lowest rating. </p>
<p>Employees are often forced to write a self evaluation prior to the meeting 
  as well. Unfortunately, these usually only serve as annoyance to employees because 
  the majority of the time it is ignored by the supervisor any way. </p>
<h3>Managers - Why They Hate the Performance Review Process</h3>
<p>Managers often dread the discussion of the employee performance review assuming 
  the discussion will turn into a battle with the manager left to convince the 
  employee that their ratings are accurate. Managers usually assume employees 
  think they perform better than they actually do.</p>
<p>Managers are busy with tasks and goals of their own . Taking the time to thoroughly 
  review a whole year&#8217;s worth of performance is time consuming. They often 
  rush through the forms because the HR department has a deadline they are struggling 
  to meet?</p>
<p>The forms are too complicated, long, short or don&#8217;t cover what is really 
  important to success in this department.</p>
<h3>So, What&#8217;s the Answer to Overcoming Negativity Around the Performance 
  Appraisal? </h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few tips to get you started:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Set clear expectations. Provide them on the first day of employment.</li>
  <li>Provide feedback all year. Create a culture where performance discussions 
    are a regular part of the work day and review meetings are held at frequent 
    intervals such as monthly.</li>
  <li>Ask first, tell later. Begin a performance discussion by asking the employee 
    to rate their performance.Have them provide examples of where they have met 
    and exceeded the expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not</strong> complete the form until you have the discussions. 
    Do monitor performance all year and have examples ready to discuss.</li>
  <li>Guarantee no surprises at the annual meeting. If you are waiting for annual 
    meeting to discuss performance, you lost your chance to be effective.</li>
</ol>
