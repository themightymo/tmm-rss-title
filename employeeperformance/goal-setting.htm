<p>Experts assert that goals assigned to employees should be directly aligned 
  with the goals from the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">strategic</a> 
  and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessplanning/index.htm">business 
  plans</a> of the organization, so the reader might benefit from scanning some 
  of the contents in those topics. Many organizations further refine those goals 
  by doing various <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">task 
  and job analysis</a> to identify what <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">competencies</a> 
  (knowledge, skills and abilities) are needed by the employee to achieve the 
  goals. The results of those activities often are itemized in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">job

<h3>Supervisors -- Regardless of Level -- Often Lack Understanding of Performance</h3>
<p>Performance is when an employee is achieving a goal in a highly effective and 
  efficient manner and when that goal is closely aligned with achieving the overall 
  goals of the organization. A common problem for new supervisors is having no 
  clear, strong sense of whether their employees are high performing or not. </p>
<p>Employees can be very busy in their roles, but that does not mean they are 
  high-performing if their roles are not directly contributing toward achieving 
  the overall goals of the organization. The first step toward solving this problem 
  is to establish clear performance goals. Some people have a strong negative 
  reaction toward setting goals because they fear goals as &#8220;the law&#8221; 
  that must be maintained and never broken. Some people fear they will never achieve 
  the goals. Others have disdain for goals because goals seem to take the &#8220;heart&#8221; 
  out of their work.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Using Performance Goals in the Workplace</h3>
<p>Despite the negative views that one can have about goals, they hold certain 
  strong advantages in the workplace. They: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide clear direction to supervisors and employees.</li>
  <li> Form a common frame of reference around which they can effectively communicate.</li>
  <li> Clearly indicate success, and can cultivate a strong sense of fulfillment 
    for those working toward achieving the goals. </li>
  <li>Help clarify the specific expectations of the supervisor and employee.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Employee Performance Gaps, Growth Gaps, Opportunity Gaps and Training Gaps</h3>
<p>Goals can be useful for specifying expectations and for setting measurements 
  of progress in working to fill four types of gaps: </p>
<h4>Performance gaps</h4>
<p>These gaps are identified during the employee performance management process. 
  Ideally, performance gaps are addressed by performance improvement plans. Performance 
  improvement plans are sometimes a last-ditch effort at helping a person to improve 
  his/her performance. Ideally, the performance problem is addressed through ongoing 
  feedback and adjustments during regular one-on-one meetings. In these plans, 
  goals are established to improve performance, and may include, for example, 
  increased effort on the part of the employee, support from his/her supervisor, 
  and certain training and resources to assist the person in his/her development. 
  Dedicated employees can greatly appreciate having specific performance goals 
  for them to achieve in order to keep their jobs, verify their competence to 
  their supervisor and accomplish overall professional development.</p>
<h4> Growth gaps </h4>
<p>These gaps are identified during career planning. Employees perceive certain 
  areas of knowledge and skills that they would like to accomplish in order to 
  qualify for certain future roles and positions. Employees often appreciate having 
  clear-cut goals that mark what they need to do to advance in their careers. 
</p>
<h4>Opportunity gaps </h4>
<p>These gaps are identified when a sudden opportunity arises for the employee. 
  If the person is highly interested in taking advantage of the opportunity, then 
  he or she will appreciate knowing exactly what goals must be achieved to take 
  advantages of the opportunity. Growth gaps and opportunity gaps are very similar. 
</p>
<h4>Training gaps </h4>
<p>These gaps are identified when hiring a new employee, during performance management 
  planning or career planning. Gaps are usually in terms of areas of knowledge, 
  skills or abilities (competencies). Training plans can be designed with clear-cut 
  training goals to give direction to the employee or trainer.<br />
  Whatever the type of goal, it is critical that the employee have strong ownership 
  and commitment to achieving the goal.</p>
<h3>Performance Goals Should Be SMARTER</h3>
<p>You can help ensure that goals are agreeable to supervisor and employee by 
  ensuring that they are highly involved in identifying the goals. When setting 
  goals with others, strive to describe them to be &#8220;SMARTER.&#8221; This 
  acronym stands for goals that are: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific</strong> -- For example, a goal to generate three types 
    of financial statements, including cash flow, budget-versus-actual and income 
    statement.</li>
  <li><strong> Measurable</strong> -- For example, to be able to assess if the 
    three types of statements were generated or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Achievable</strong> -- For example, the goal would be irrelevant 
    if the person had no access to the financial information from which to generate 
    the statements. </li>
  <li><strong>Relevant</strong> -- For example, the goal would not be useful if 
    the organization has no plans to ever make decisions based on the financial 
    statements.</li>
  <li> <strong>Timely</strong> -- The statements should be generated by a certain 
    deadline, for example, in time for the Board to review and approve the statements.</li>
  <li> <strong>Extending capabilities</strong> -- Ideally, the goal involves the 
    person&#8217;s learning more than they already knew about generating statements.</li>
  <li> <strong>Rewarding</strong> -- Ideally, the activities of generating the 
    financial statements would be fulfilling for the person to accomplish. If 
    goals seem insurmountable to the employee, then break goals down into smaller 
    goals, or sub-goals or objectives until they are SMARTER. </li>
</ul>
