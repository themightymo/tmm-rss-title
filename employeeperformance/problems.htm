  Problems</h2>

<p>(Note that if your organization's policies about performance management indicate 
  a specific procedure for handling performance issues, that procedure should 
  be followed very carefully. Otherwise, a court may interpret your official policies 
  to be modified by how you actually handled a performance issue and you may lose 
  protection from your related policies in court.) </p>
<p>1 . <b>Note that performance issues should always be based on behaviors that 
  were actually seen, not on characteristics that you or someone else senses or 
  intuits about the employee's personality.</b> . </p>
<p>2. <b>Convey performance issues to employees when you see first see the issues!</b><br />
  Don't wait until the performance review! Worse yet, don't ignore the behaviors 
  in case they &quot;go away.&quot;</p>
<p>3. <b>When you first convey a performance issue to an employee, say what you 
  noticed and would like to see instead.</b><br />
  Be specific about what you saw that you have a problem with. Ask the employee 
  for feedback. Ask the employee if there's any special training or more resources 
  they need to do their job. Explore if the job is configured so that must people 
  would probably fail, and so the job needs to be redesigned. Tell them that you 
  want the behavior to improve. If they react strongly and claim they will quit, 
  give them a day to think it over. In any case, remind them that you support 
  them in their role.</p>
<p>4. <b>Consider special circumstances.</b> <br />
  You can usually fire someone if they committed certain gross acts, such as theft, 
  blatant insubordination, a major impropriety, e.g., telling information to competitors 
  or spreading confidential information about clients, etc. However, if there 
  is poor performance or chronic absenteeism because of potential verified alcoholism 
  or depression, it's best to consult an expert to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>5. <b>Make notes about the first meeting and its results, and keep it in a 
  file for yourself. You might mention the situation to your board.</b><br />
  This note may come in handy later on if the performance problem persists. The 
  board will likely be a precious and objective asset to dealing with this situation, 
  especially if things with the employee get worse.</p>
<p>6. <b>If the problem occurs again over the next two months, immediately issue 
  them a written warning. Also, update the board.</b><br />
  In the memo, clearly specify what you saw, mention the previous meeting and 
  its date, say the behaviors have not improved, warn them that if this occurs 
  again over some period (e.g., the next month), they will be promptly terminated. 
  Meet with them to provide them the memo. If you are convinced that the employee 
  is trying hard, but can't improve, consider placing him or her elsewhere in 
  the organization. Attempt to have this meeting on other than on a Friday. Otherwise, 
  employees are left to ruminate about the situation without ready access to you 
  for at least three days.</p>
<p>7. <b>On the third occurrence, consider firing the employee</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="job" id="job"></a>Employee Commitment: Get Rid of &quot;It's Not 
  My Job!&quot;</h2>
<p>By <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<p>The attitude &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a rip about my job&#8221; happens every 
  single day.</p>
<p>Employees get this way when they are bored with their job, or feel like a faceless 
  cog in a big wheel or don&#8217;t know how &#8220;what they do&#8221; specifically 
  contributes to the goals of their department or business unit. So what causes 
  it? How can you, as a supervisor, prevent &#8220;It&#8217;s not my job&#8221; 
  from happening within your team or department?<br />
  Here are three ways to develop employee commitment.</p>
<h3>1. Communicate the importance of what they do.</h3>
<p>Every supervisor should be able to state a meaningful purpose for his department 
  and the work that is being done. Here is a short but powerful statement that 
  was developed by a manager for her five-person benefits group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Benefits are about people. It&#8217;s not whether you have the forms 
  filled in or whether the checks are written. It&#8217;s whether the people are 
  cared for when they&#8217;re sick, helped when they&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a statement with the focus on the end result&#8212;serving people&#8212;rather 
  than on the means or process&#8212;completing forms. How well do you communicate 
  the importance of what is being done in your department?</p>
<h3>2. Recognize the importance of recognition.</h3>
<p>The motto of many supervisors is: &#8220;Why would I need to thank someone 
  for doing something he&#8217;s paid to do?&#8221; Workers repeatedly tell, with 
  great feeling, how much they appreciate a compliment. They also report how distressed 
  they are when their supervisor is quick to criticize mistakes but not acknowledge 
  good work.</p>
<p>A pat on the back, simply saying &#8220;good going,&#8221; a dinner for two, 
  a note about them to senior executives, some schedule flexibility, a paid day 
  off, or even a flower on a desk with a thank-you note are a few of the hundreds 
  of ways supervisors can show their appreciation. Money may get people in the 
  door but it doesn&#8217;t keep them motivated to go the extra mile. </p>
<h3>3. Tap into the importance of involvement.</h3>
<p>There may be no single motivational tactic more powerful than asking for people&#8217;s 
  input. An accounting manager presented a list of customer complaints at a staff 
  meeting. She then broke the group into teams to find ways to eliminate these 
  service glitches.</p>
<p>Getting every one involved in problem-solving accomplished three goals. It 
  brought the customers to the center of the department&#8217;s day-to-day operations; 
  it lead to greater &#8216;buy-in&#8221; when changes had to be made in a process, 
  policy or procedures; and finally it said to everyone that they and their ideas 
  are valued.</p>
<p>As one very proud production line worker in an automotive plant said to me, 
  &#8220;They only looked at what we could do from our neck down&#8230;now it&#8217;s 
  for what we can do from our neck up.&#8221;<br />
  Management Success Tip:</p>
<p>It is true that most people must work to survive and money is certainly a motivator 
  &#8212; but up to a point. For your employees to achieve great things, they 
  need to experience purpose, recognition and involvement. As a supervisor you 
  can provide that. It costs you nothing. And you might gain greater productivity 
  and profitability.</p>
