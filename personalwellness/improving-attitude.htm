<h1>You've Got an Attitude (Improving Your Attitude)</h1>

<!--[index|Personal Wellness]-->

<p>A person's attitude represents how they feel or their state
of mind about something. For example, one can have a good (or
positive) attitude toward their work, usually meaning that they
feel good about their work, their job, their organization, etc.
Many features of working in an organization can cause a person
to have a poor attitude about their jobs and organizations (that
is, they feel bad about their jobs and organizations), eg, inadequate
compensation, conflicts with their supervisor, inconsistent or
conflicting communications from senior management, unfulfilling
work, hostile communications between employees, etc. Some people
adopt a poor attitude because that is their way &quot;of being
in the world,&quot; ie, they often resent their environment no
matter what is going on around them. Some people feel poorly about
themselves, which affects their attitude about their environment,
as well. In contrast, some people work hard to keep a positive
attitude. These people often have better overall health and can
effectively address major challenges in the workplace, as well.</p>
