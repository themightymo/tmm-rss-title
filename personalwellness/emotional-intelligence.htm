<p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize the emotions of yourself 
  and others around you, manage for potential affects of your emotions on others, 
  and consider all of the emotions in relations and in decision making and problem 
  solving. Emotional intelligence is a critical ingredient in self-leadership 
  and in leadership of others and it requires one to be self-aware and have strong 
  empathy for others.</p>

  <li>There are different definitions for emotional intelligence (EI), but it 
    is probably fair to generalize that it is the ability to recognize our emotions 
    and then manage our responses to those emotions in a manner that enhances 
    our health and relationships with others. There are some basic guidelines 
    that might be useful in enhancing your own EI. Consider the following basic 
    guidelines:</li>
  <li>Notice how you are feeling and be able to name the emotion, for example, 
    mad, glad, sad or bad. Be careful not to get confused between your thoughts 
    and feelings. Notice the difference between and then use &#8220;I feel &#8230;&#8221; 
    and &#8220;I think &#8230;&#8221; statements. </li>
  <li>Notice how you judge those emotions, for example, you might believe that 
    &#8220;it is scary and bad to feel angry.&#8221; </li>
  <li>Notice what situations typically evoke those emotions in you.</li>
  <li> Notice the difference between your emotions and your outward responses 
    to those emotions &#8211; what others would see you do and say. Ask yourself 
    how you choose to feel about something and whether your behavior is aligned 
    with that choice. </li>
  <li>Realize that it is OK to have strong emotional reactions. It is what you 
    do with those emotions that can be a problem for you and others. </li>
  <li>Notice how long you retain those emotions. What changes them?</li>
  <li> Notice what makes you happy and plan for those situations on a regular 
    basis.</li>
  <li> Notice how you make conclusions about other peoples&#8217; feelings. What 
    are they doing or saying?</li>
</ol>
