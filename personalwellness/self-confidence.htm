<h1>Nurturing Self-Confidence</h1>

<!--[index|Personal Wellness]-->

<p>Self-confidence is being certain and trusting about yourself
in regard to addressing certain tasks or all tasks. Self-confidence
is critical to effective performance in the workplace and is the
source of assertiveness, which is fully representing yourself
(your opinions, recommendations, etc.) to others. One's self-confidence
can be cultivated by using a variety of approaches, eg, ongoing
success when performing tasks, ongoing support and affirmation
from supervisors, successful coaching (from oneself and others)
in the workplace, etc.</p>

<p>Self-esteem is a one's overall belief in their value as an
individual, a human being. Thus, the concepts of self-esteem and
self-confidence are closely related.</p>
