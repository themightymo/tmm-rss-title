<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Job Satisfaction?</h2>
<p>Job satisfaction is in regard to one's feelings or state-of-mind regarding 
  the nature of their work. Job satisfaction can be influenced by a variety of 
  factors, eg, the quality of one's relationship with their supervisor, the quality 
  of the physical environment in which they work, degree of fulfillment in their 
  work, etc.</p>
<p>(To my knowledge, there is no strong acceptance among researchers, consultants, etc., that increased job satisfaction produces improved job performance -- in fact, improved job satisfaction can sometimes decrease job performance. For example, you could let someone sit around all day and do nothing. That may make them more satisfied with their &quot;work&quot; in the short run, but their performance certainly won't improve.)</p>

<h2><a name="career" id="career"></a>Career Satisfaction: Do You Have It?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<h3>Do you &#8220;work to live or live to work&#8221;?</h3>
<p>In a recent Leading News, e-newsletter, from Marshall Goldsmith, the premier 
  executive coach, asked that question. Why? Because if you figured how time you 
  spent at work &#8211; approximately one-third of our waking hours &#8211; then 
  you realize that your job has a significant impact on your life.</p>
<p>He created an exercise to help people evaluate their job satisfaction and, 
  mostly importantly, their career choice. There are three categories and you 
  are to estimate the percentage of your job that falls within each category.</p>
<h3>You Try It.</h3>
<p>The first category is &#8220;play.&#8221; This is job content that is fun and 
  what you would tend to do regardless of whether or not you were compensated 
  for it. We have all seen people readily agree to do a task that was beyond the 
  job description. Why? Because it was a task they viewed as fun, as an outlet 
  for untapped creativity or a channel for self-development. If I tell myself, 
  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to play,&#8221; then there is no resistance or creative 
  avoidance.</p>
<p>The second category is &#8220;work.&#8221; This is job content that is not 
  play. It&#8217;s work. This is an activity that, although not fun, you would 
  agree to do for reasonable compensation.</p>
<p>The third category is &#8220;misery.&#8221; Job content in this category is 
  not only not play, but it is drudgery, and at times pure h-ell. And we can find 
  all times of creative reasons to avoid and procrastinate.</p>
<p>How do you see the composition of your work experience concerning activities 
  that are categorized as play, work, and misery? Do you need to write yourself 
  a new job description?</p>
<p>Here are the typical survey results among professionals:</p>
<p> 15 percent of what professionals do is considered play;<br />
  75 percent of what professionals do is considered work;<br />
  10 percent of what professionals do is considered misery.</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>Most professional jobs can be molded or shaped to allow for individual situations 
  or for one&#8217;s growth and development needs. Think about ways to add things 
  to your job that will allow you to play more or take some things out that will 
  allow you to be more satisfied. Then go to your boss and make a case for it 
  &#8211; not that it will make you happier but that it can add to your productivity.</p>
<h2><a name="job" id="job"></a>Job Satisfaction: Is it Time to Stay or Leave?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<h3>Have you lost that &#8220;loving&#8221; feeling?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve survived the layoffs, cut wages, reorganizations and other company 
  changes. You&#8216;re stressed out, fed up and ready to bolt. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the economy is going nowhere, the analysts aren&#8217;t 
  sure if we&#8217;re in recovery, recession or something in-between and you&#8217;re 
  being told &#8220;you have a job, be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, should you stay or leave? Before you make that critical career decision, 
  take a deep breath, assess your situation and do a cost benefit analysis.</p>
<h3>First, consider the reasons to stay. For example:</h3>
<p>1. Relationships matter more than money.</p>
<p>You may think you can find a job that will pay you more, but you will be leaving 
  behind a wealth of relationships. When weighing your options, don&#8217;t forget 
  the value of the network, the friends and professional colleagues you have now.</p>
<p>2. You are doing well compared to your peers.</p>
<p>Research shows that many people under estimate their skills and their prospects 
  and over estimate others. Take the time to do a realistic assessment of what 
  you have to offer and its value in today&#8217;s marketplace.</p>
<p>3. The grass is not always greener.</p>
<p>People, who are desperate to get out of a job, tend to see potential opportunities 
  only outside their company. They enthusiastically take a new job and then realize 
  they&#8217;ve gone from the proverbial frying pan into the fire.</p>
<h3>Now, consider the reasons to leave. For example:</h3>
<p>1. Your relationship with your boss is damaged beyond repair.<br />
  You have tried to mend it but you&#8217;re getting stonewalled. Yes, she may 
  be a jerk but she is the boss and in a power struggle, you will probably lose.</p>
<p>2. Your values are at odds with the culture.<br />
  For example, your company is hierarchical and you want more influence over your 
  job. It&#8217;s very hard for one person to change a culture unless he&#8217;s 
  the CEO or has been brought in to change things.</p>
<p>3. Your stress level is way off the charts.<br />
  It&#8217;s affecting your physical or mental health and your relationships with 
  family and friends. You&#8217;re burnt out, burnt up and dread going to work.</p>
<h3>So what will it be &#8211; stay or leave?</h3>
<p>In looking at the reasons to stay and the reasons to leave, which will have 
  the best impact on your personal and career satisfaction? What will provide 
  you with the most benefit today? What about tomorrow?</p>
