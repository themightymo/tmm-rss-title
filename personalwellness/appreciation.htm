<h3>Why Is the Ability to Appreciate Accomplishments So Important?</h3>
<p>Particularly with personnel in small- to medium-size organizations, it is rare 
  that there is not a large amount of work to do. Because time is such a precious 
  commodity in these organizations, it is common that their people cannot provide 
  sustained effort to priorities and projects. Many times, they get put on &#8220;hold&#8221; 
  for a few weeks as people attend to other sudden demands for their time, for 
  example, developing a major proposal for a new customer, the Chief Executive 
  Officer&#8217;s leaving for vacation, preparing for their annual meeting, or 
  finishing a large product evaluation. For you and your employees, it can seem 
  that activities have stalled out completely. </p>
<p>For many of us, it can seem like we are stuck in a merry-go-round that never 
  goes anywhere and we cannot seem to get off. By ignoring our accomplishments, 
  we are ignoring vast portions of our lives and our work &#8211; our perspective 
  can become skewed and incomplete. That perspective can be a major obstacle to 
  the success of leaders. </p>
<h3>How Can You Maintain Appreciation for Appreciation?</h3>
<p>As a leader, you can make a big difference in your effectiveness and that of 
  your peoples&#8217; accomplishments if all of you have the ability to recognize 
  and appreciate your accomplishments regularly. Consider the following guidelines.</p>
<h3>1. Convey the importance of appreciation when you start working with others.</h3>
<p>Explain how important it is to recognize accomplishments as well as the tasks 
  yet to be done. Mention it is really important in small- to medium-sized organizations. 
</p>
<h3>2. Ask employees for ideas about how to regularly recognize completion of 
  tasks. </h3>
<p>Different cultures have different practices. Some might prefer a simple &#8220;Thank 
  you,&#8221; while others might prefer a ritual of some sort. Therefore, it is 
  important early in your leadership role to get ideas from your people. </p>
<h3>3. When planning, build in acknowledgement of completion in plans.</h3>
<p>Planning always results in a list of things to do. Too often, the design of 
  the plans does not include means to recognize accomplishments. Planning is one 
  of the best opportunities to regularly build in means to recognize accomplishments. 
</p>
<h3>4. Design project tasks so it is clear whether they were finished or not.</h3>
<p>This is often one of the biggest challenges in developing a sense of appreciation. 
  Ideally, goals, objectives and other tasks are designed to be SMART, an acronym 
  for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely. </p>
<h3>5. Regularly acknowledge the completion of the tasks or progress on tasks.</h3>
<p>Always seek to find opportunities to appreciate the work of your people. That 
  practice can be a powerful means to model behaviors that they learn from in 
  their lives and work. </p>
