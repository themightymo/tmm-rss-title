<p>I&#146;ve got your application here.<br />
You&#146;re a Minneapolis native?<br />
I ask these things as &quot;need to know.&quot;<br />
You see, here, we&#146;re &quot;participative&quot;!</p>

<p>Your predecessor&#146;s out the door.<br />
Problems too numerous to mention.<br />
Listen to me and you&#146;ll be fine,<br />
And you&#146;ll be here to get your pension.</p>

<p>I want weekly status reports.<br />
Fully describe how your past week went.<br />
Tell me all your work planned and done,<br />
And, oh yeah, &#147;practice empowerment&#148;!</p>

<p>You&#146;re empowered &#150; apply yourself!<br />
But do everything that I tell you!<br />
If you don't, you&#146;ll feel it later<br />
When I do your performance review!</p>

<p>See H.R. for the forms to sign<br />
And later I'll show you the budget.<br />
And after some experience,<br />
Then I&#146;ll show you how to, ah, &#147;fudge&#148; it.</p>

<p>Know the key factors in your life:<br />
The Company&#146;s sales and production,<br />
Its net income, its marketshare &#150;<br />
And understand &quot;globalization&quot;!</p>

<p>And, understand customers' needs.<br />
Yes, always give what must be given!<br />
You simply have to, there's no choice.<br />
You see, here, we're &quot;customer-driven&quot;!</p>

<p>Between you and your employees,<br />
Always &#147;honor the new covenant.&#148;<br />
If they doubt you, and you need help:<br />
Organization development!</p>

<p>Yes, if you&#146;re stuck, they&#146;ve courses in<br />
Whatever you think you are needing.<br />
Courses in time or stress management,<br />
Team building &#150; or even in Leading!</p>

<p>Our consultant says, &#147;We must change,<br />
And let &#145;change&#146; be our incantation<br />
If we&#146;re to meet our grandest goal:<br />
To &#145;transform our organization&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p>That damn H.R.! Their latest fad?<br />
&#147;To appreciate diversity!&#148;<br />
(You&#146;re short on your quotas, you know,<br />
So, now, bring in more minorities!)</p>

<p>Yes, we have &#147;soul in the workplace,&#148;<br />
But don&#146;t let your feelings delay us!<br />
Our company's ever-onward,<br />
And doing it, &#147;thriving on chaos!&#148;</p>

<p>You can be here from &quot;womb to tomb&quot; &#150;<br />
You just take what The Company gives!<br />
Commit yourself to its mission,<br />
To its strategies, its objectives!</p>

<p>Yes, dot your &quot;i&quot;s and cross your &quot;t&quot;s<br />
In all documents signed, filed or sent.<br />
With luck and visibility,<br />
You, too, can make Middle Management!</p>

<p>Me? Met one of my MBOs:<br />
I computed the budget today.<br />
Planned more than I ever needed<br />
So my year-end spending is OK.</p>

<p>I &#147;continuously improve&#148;!<br />
I bought all these new books off the shelf.<br />
I took the time and scanned them some,<br />
Then promptly &#147;reinvented myself.&#148;</p>

<p>I have my MBA, you know.<br />
Yes, I can take pride in my leisure!<br />
But, there's always something to do,<br />
A new policy, new procedure ...</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could relax, <br />
Take a minute and do what I please ...<br />
But then we&#146;d lose sight of our goal:<br />
To compete like those damn Japanese!</p>

<p>Well, that&#146;s all for today. I&#146;m done.<br />
You can go now. This is a good start.<br />
Have any questions, just ask me,<br />
Over you, right here on this org chart ...</p>

<p>----- </p>

<p><i>Disjointed, diffused, brain-dead and dumb,<br />
Dumped here in my tomb, stone alone.<br />
A third of my life, empty and numb. <br />
&quot;Good doggy! Keep fetching that bone!&quot;</i></p>
