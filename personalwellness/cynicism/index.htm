<p> Cynicism is distrust of the intentions of others, a belief that others are 
  not representing their true motives. Research indicates a growing cynicism among 
  managers and workers in America. However, there are few resources to address 
  this syndrome. Also, it seems, few practitioners (educators, consultants, trainers 
  and developers, human resource personnel, etc.) recognize and/or want to deal 
  with this cynicism. Consequently, many people, especially those who have gone 
  through many programs in the workplace, promptly resist attempts at organizational 
  change because they don't completely believe in the reasons for the change. 
  Hopefully, more practitioners will learn to 
<p>Literature indicates a high rate of current cynicism, which is expected to 
  continue into the future, yet there are few resources available to address this 
  issue. To better comprehend cynicism, the following provides a definition and 
  description, along with historical information. Then, reasons are explained 
  regarding why organization members resort to cynicism, and a description is 
  given regarding the general effect of cynicism in business and industry. Next, 
  recommendations are given to address this cynicism. The paper closes with observations 
  and a critique about this research effort, along with recommendations for further 
  study.

<h2>Cynicism in Business and Industry</h2>
<h3>Cynicism Is On the Rise</h3>
<p>Research over the past five years indicates that cynicism is on
the rise in American business and industry, which increasingly
hurts their competitiveness and ability to accommodate today's
needed organizational change. Paul J. Rosen (Hendrick, 1993, p.
E1:2), President of the American Institute of Stress, indicates
that recent, dizzying changes in technology and the economy are
causing unprecedented burnout, cynicism, sickness and absenteeism.</p>

<p>Organizational psychologist and consultant, Philip H. Mirvis,
and Professor Donald L. Kanter (1989, p. 377) found, in their
national survey of 649 workers, that one bold theme prevailed:
&quot;self-interest and opportunism mark today's wised-up employee.&quot;
They classified 43% of these workers as being cynical (p. 379),
and 40% of the managers and supervisors as being cynical, as well
(p. 381). In a later study (Mirvis and Kanter, 1991), they concluded
that more workers were cynical, rising from 43% to 48% (p. 50).
In addition, they found that 65% of American workers agree that
people will lie if they'll gain from it (p. 50), 41% of the population
doubts the truth of what management tells them (p. 52), and 49%
say that management will take advantage of them, given a chance
(p.52). </p>
<p>
Over the past 20 years, confidence in business has fallen from
70% to 15%, and ratings of management competence and trust have
fallen almost as among workers in the same period (Mirvis and
Kanter, 1991, p. 46). Mirvis (1991, p. 2) claims, &quot;It has
now reached the point where cynicism is chic and loyalty to the
company is for saps and suckers.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Future Does Not Look Any Brighter</h3>
<p>
Tomorrow's business leaders are already cynical. Writer Jerri
Stroud (1994, p. E1:2) reports that a recent Washington University
survey shows that &quot;business students are almost as cynical
about corporate managers as corporate people themselves.&quot;
Authors and business consultants, Lawrence Bradford and Claire
Raines (1992) indicate that among eight core values in &quot;twentysomethings&quot;
(the group of 48 million people between the ages 18 to 29), is
the value of cynicism. Some social scientists consider them the
&quot;why bother?&quot; generation. Writers David M. Gross and
Sophronia Scott (1990, p. 62) concur that twentysomethings reject
the values of baby boomers, and their major characteristic is
to avoid pain and rapid change. &quot;Maybe they are just a little
too cynical when it comes to the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Professors Fred H. Goldner, R. Richard Ritti, and Thomas P.
Ference (1977) suggest that as today's organizations become more
complex, members become more cynical. This does not bode well,
considering that our organizations are indeed becoming more complex
as they struggle to respond to increased competition, public expectations,
dynamic technologies, and a diverse workforce.</p>

<p>Writer Deirdre Wilson (1989) recounts for us how this increased
disillusionment is hurting American business' competitive edge,
as a result of workers' decreased commitment and productivity.
And as business and industry struggles to remain competitive,
organizational change efforts are often blocked by cynical managers.
Professor Dennis Jaffe and consultant Cynthia D. Scott (1992,
p. 139) explain that managers can undermine large-scale organizational
transformation through impatience, emotional illiteracy, elitism,
insecurity, poor modeling, anger, and alienation. Mirvis and Kanter
(1991) describe cynics as believing that the best way to handle
people is to tell them what they want to hear, management never
reveals the real reasons behind decisions, it doesn't pay to work
extra hard, and management is more interested in short-term profits
than the long-term.</p>

<h2>What is Cynicism?</h2>
<h3>A Definition</h3>
<p>
The dictionary (Merriam-Webster, 1993, p. 323) defines a cynic
as &quot; one who believes that human conduct is motivated wholly
by self-interest.&quot; This should not be confused with a &quot;skeptic,&quot;
as defined by the same dictionary to have &quot;an attitude of
doubt&quot; (p. 1212). Mirvis and Kanter (1989) are careful throughout
their work to remind us that cynicism is different from skepticism
which is healthy response to work and life. Skeptics are open
to change. Cynics aren't.</p>

<p>Cultures, as well as organization members, can be classified
as cynical. They operate only &quot;for the bottom line&quot;,
they scoff at change efforts and management fads, they tolerate
shoddy products and services (Mirvis and Kanter, 1989, p. 382). 
In their latter study (Mirvis and Kanter (1991, p. 61), they
describe cynical companies as those that &quot;embody expedient,
self-serving values, that support managers who engage in deceptive
and exploitative practices, and that communicate in a one-sided,
hyped-up, and disingenuous fashion to their employees.&quot;</p>

<p>A good summary description of the cynic comes from Mirvis and
Kanter (1991, pp. 50-2). Cynics &quot;agree that lying, putting
on a false face, and taking advantage of others are fundamental
to human character and conclude that, basically, people are just
out for themselves&quot; and that &quot;such cynical attitudes
about life are paralleled in attitudes about work.&quot; </p>
<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p>
In the fourth century B.C., a group of philosophers, followers
of Antisthenes, flouted &quot;popular opinion or public convictions
simply for the sake of doing so,&quot; particularly a prominent
member, Diogenes (Copleston, 1985, p. 189) . Greeks deemed these
followers &quot;disciples of the dog,&quot; or Cynics. Still,
Antisthenes was a serious follower of Socrates, a man of deliberate
and applied conviction, and Cynics were perceived as progressive
and taken seriously enough to involve in serious debate. As other
Greek philosophers (particularly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle)
became more widely known and followed, Cynics soon died out. However,
in the third century, A. D., during the moral corruption of Rome,
Cynicism was revived as a school of thought, but this time it
&quot;tended to lose its serious character of emphasis on independence,
suppression of desire and physical endurance, and to give itself
rather to mockery of convention and tradition and prevailing beliefs
and modes of behaviour&quot; (Copleston, 1985, p. 142). This impression
and use of the term &quot;cynicism&quot; remains today.</p>

<p>Probably the best known work in regard to cynicism is The Prince
(Machiavelli, 1952). The book was written by Machiavelli when
giving advice to the current Italian prince, describing how to
advance self-interest by pragmatically using any means available
to advance one's ends. The book remains a seminal work in studying
the art of political persuasion.</p>

<h3>The Demographics of Cynicism</h3>
<p>
Mirvis and Kanter (1991) indicate that higher income and education
levels typically are associated with a wider extent of employment
choices and freedom, and, consequently, less cynicism. Research
indicates young people expect more from society than they get.
Young, poor, undereducated, minority and blue-collar workers generally
have higher levels of cynicism than older, less poor, more educated,
Caucasian, white-collar workers, particularly those in the healing
and teaching professions. Men are perceived more frequently as
being cynical than women. Middle-aged, or boomers, are not as
cynical as younger people. Those over 55 are the most cynical,
probably because they have less education, lower incomes, and
have been hit hard in recent layoffs. Profit-making organizations
had higher levels of cynicism.</p>

<h3>Outlook of the Cynic</h3>
<p>
In their latter research effort, Mirvis and Kanter (1991) found
a strong correspondence between people's general perceptions of
society and leadership and their more specific views of their
own organization, managers and co-workers. Consequently, it's
important to understand the cynic's outlook on life. Mirvis and
Kanter (1989) &quot;see selfishness and guile at the base of human
nature. They agree that people will tell a lie if they can gain
by it, that people pretend to care about one another more than
the really do, and that people may claim to be honest and moral
but act otherwise when money is at stake.&quot; They often consider
their view as &quot;realistic.&quot;</p>

<p>Cynics don't trust management, find the pay system to be fair,
think they have fair chance for advancement, don't believe management
listens to them or value their jobs (Mirvis and Kanter, 1989).
Cynical managers &quot;are skilled in controlling information
and exercising power through operatives&quot; (Mirvis and Kanter,
1989, p. 381) In their mind, they 'made it the hard way,' and
anyone who has not is weak, naive, inept, or just plain stupid&quot;
(Mirvis and Kanter, 1989, p. 381).</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1989) go on to convey that cynics appear
aloof and unfeeling, and treat people as if they were machines.
Cynics are open and vocal about how the game is played, they see
through company politics and thrive on inside dope. They yield
cynicism like a sword.</p>

<h2>Why Do Organization Members Resort to Cynicism?</h2>
<h3>What's the Use of Cynicism?</h3>
<p>
Mirvis and Kanter (1991) explain that cynicism is a way to cope
with what's perceived by the cynic to be an unfriendly, unstable,
and insecure world. Cynicism provides a ready and convenient explanation
for a perception of continued disappointment and disillusionment.
And it lets one indulge in their anger and resentment, often acting
it out in the workplace.</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1989, p. 381) explain that cynics use cynical
attitudes to &quot;emotionally protect themselves from what they
imagine to be the slings and arrows of hustlers and high-ups.&quot;
&quot;They blame the 'system' for their disappointments and failings.&quot;
A cynic can continue to function in most organizations, conducting
the day-to-day duties of his or her role. Depending on the nature
of how they implement their cynical views and motives, they may
even advance up the corporate ladder, based on effective finger-pointing
and back-biting. If they crave the acceptance of others, successive
promotions may feed this personal need. It's only after other
members recognize the insidious effects of the behavior of the
cynic, that &quot;intervention&quot; can occur, often in the form
of performance problem identification and response.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Mirvis and Kanter explain (1989) because
of the obstructionist and covert nature of their behavior, cynics
are often perceived as gripers, back-biters, and poor performers.
Consequently, they do not succeed in the organization. This, of
course, is perceived by the cynic as further manipulation and
unfairness by management. And the cycle goes on.</p>

<h3>What Causes Cynicism?</h3>
<p>Again, Mirvis and Kanter put it best (1989, p. 383) the recipe
is simple: &quot;hype up people's hopes, disappoint them, and
then take advantage of them until they become disillusioned.&quot;
In their latter study, Mirvis and Kanter (1991) explain there
are three key ingredients to cynicism, 1) unrealistically high
expectations of oneself and others, 2) the experience of disappointment
in oneself and others (and the resulting feelings of frustration
and defeat), and 3) disillusionment, and being deceived by others.</p>

<p>These researchers purport that cynicism in American workers
has been cultivated a variety of factors, many of them demographical
and sociological (1991). Over the past 20 years, there has been
widespread organizational pain and frustration as a result of
the loss of over 20 million jobs in the 1980s as companies were
cutting back, downsizing (&quot;rightsizing&quot;), merging and
acquiring more than ever before. Today's youth have not found
the same job opportunities or equivalent compensation as their
parents. The media has had a continued and widespread effect through
its singular focus on duplicitous authorities and unresponsive
organizations. The Reagan era saw the rich get richer, and America
turn into a debtor nation as never before. Greed and avarice came
into fashion. Concurrently, the S &amp; L scandal, Congressional
scams, and unethical business practices caste a pallor over the
ideals of American workers. CEO's have been reported to be making
up to 500 times the lowest salary in the organization. Surveys
indicate that a majority of working people perceive their pay
and promotion systems as unfair, and that they aren't involved
enough in organizational decisions.</p>

<p>The seeds of cynicism may have been planted in many of today's
managers as far back as Watergate and Viet Nam. Writer Tara Shioya
(1992, p. A1:1) relates that &quot;many people born between 1961
and 1981, of all political persuasions, say (Nixon's resignation)
planted in their minds the seeds of what would later become a
profound and widespread cynicism.&quot;</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1989) describe four aspects of company life
that most often disillusion people, including perceptions that
the 1) pay system is rigged, 2) management can't be trusted, 3)
company doesn't care and 4) the organization's time is at a premium.
Effective responses to these concerns, respectively, include widely
communicating the rationale and structure of the pay system, making
hard truths testable and verifiable, bringing community into the
workplace, and giving organization members more control over their
time.</p>

<h2>Effect of Cynicism on Business and Industry</h2>
<p></p>

<p>The effect of cynicism can be disastrous, particularly if the
cynic is a manager. Mirvis and Kanter (1989, p. 382) explain that
the attitude of the cynical manager &quot;leads to a workplace
environment dominated by a feeling of temporariness, an absence
of a lasting vision of what the company and its products ought
to be.&quot; Cynical managers convey their attitudes by running
the business only for the bottom line, treating long-term strategies
as subordinate to those of the short-term, treating employees
as &quot;hands,&quot; and tolerating shoddy products. And in managing
in a cynical fashion, they insidiously instill cynicism in their
employees and organizational culture. Members live by the law
of the jungle.</p>

<p>None of this makes for effective member participation in organizational
change efforts. Consultants Carol Sanford and Pamela Mang (1992,
p. 157) convey that &quot;it takes equal effort on the part of
operators (non-managers) to overcome patterns, one of the most
common being the fear and/or cynicism that this is just another
'program of the month'.&quot; Members perceive change as being
done solely in the interest of management. Resulting lack of cooperation
in organizational change efforts results in further insincerity
and even anger from management, thereby entrenching the status
quo and continuing to severely damage the organization.</p>

<p>Cynicism leads to a generalized mistrust of authority, to disparagement
of management communications and directions, and ultimately to
denigration of the leadership and mission of the enterprise. This
is directly counter to the requirements for several key aspects
of effective organization development actions. As explained by
Professors Thomas G. Cummings and Christopher G. Worley (Cummings
and Worley, 1993), it's vital that the organization development
agent establish an effective and trusting relationship with relevant
change agents in the organization. This isn't possible with a
cynic, considering their mistrustful nature. Do to this lack of
trust, other organization development activities are blocked,
including establishing a diagnostic contract, obtaining valid
data, accomplishing organizational members' ownership in feedback
data, overcoming resistance to change, and managing the dynamics
of and sustaining the change. And it's certainly unlikely that
successful intervention and implementation will take place, considering
the need for organization members to provide their ongoing commitment
and support.</p>

<p>The disastrous effects of organizational cynicism are beginning
to be recognized. Writer Barry Stephen (1994, p. A17) relates
that Vice President Gore, after a Georgetown University seminar
that compared past management theories and practices with new
ideas, urged American executives &quot;to abandon the cynicism
of the workplace culture&quot;; otherwise plans to reinvigorate
the nation's bureaucracy would not succeed.</p>

<h2>Recommendations to Address Cynicism</h2>
<h3>Recommendations for Business and Industry</h3>
<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1991) identify six work-related factors that
influence work attitudes, including 1) contextual factors (organizations
size, shape, job mix, etc.), 2) employment content (working conditions,
work groups, pay practices, etc.), 3) demographics (structural
and psychological), 4) psychographics (values and lifestyles),
5) life content (family structure, income, etc.), and 6) the general
state of the economy, politics, and society. Among these factors,
the second, employment content, is usually the best predictor
of work attitudes and subject of praise or criticism. Cummings
and Worley (1993, pp. 165-167) classify issues in employment content
as human process and human resource issues, and suggest a several
organization development interventions for each type of issue.</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1991) believe that organizations must address
this increasing cynicism by managing more fairly, and operating
in an open, honest, straightforward, and particularly, realistic
manner. Employees must be able to participate in governance, provide
regular reality checks to management, have positive role models,
and perceive an open and honest pay system.</p>

<p>Finally, give employees something to believe in. The use of
corporate mission and values statement may prove to be useful
here, but the major factor is if they are widely distributed,
and actively and consistently implemented.</p>

<p>Professors Eric. D. Poole, Robert M. Regoli, and Roy Lotz (1989)
suggest that increasing a sense of professionalism may reduce
cynicism and work alienation in police chiefs. Regoli, Poole,
and Lotz (1981) found that generally only one professional dimension
-- a sense of calling -- reduced prison guard's cynicism. They
suggested that prisons work overall to try to make work an end
in itself. Professors Robert M. Regoli, John P. Crank, and Robert
G. Culbertson (1989) investigated police cynicism, job satisfaction,
and work relations of police chiefs in departments of different
sizes and concluded that the larger the organization, the more
likely to have more cynical police chiefs, largely due to the
less direct communications, control and clarity of directions
than in smaller departments.</p>

<p>One must be careful not to extrapolate conclusions about effective addressing 
  cynicism in business and industry from these prison and police studies, because 
  of the markedly different cultures, including the nature of systems, structures, 
  communication and control.</p>
<h2>Author's Observations, Critique and Response</h2>
<p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
I strongly suspect there will be soon be a noticeable increase
in interest and research in this area, as more organizations attempt
effective organization development diagnoses, intervention, and
implementations. </p>
<h3>Limits of this Research</h3>
<p>
While remaining keenly interested in cynicism, I continue to be
frustrated with the lack of available research regarding cynicism
in business and industry. Despite the increase of cynicism in
business and industry, there is little research on cynicism, including
what it is, what causes it, how it effects organizations, and
what can be done to effectively address it. Mirvis and Kanter
remain the primary researchers in regard to this topic. Most of
the cynicism-related research is in regard to the phenomena in
the police, prison and nursing professions. As mentioned above,
one must be careful not to readily extrapolate information from
these studies to apply to business and industry. </p>
<p>
In addition, findings of this research must be interpretive and
suggestive, rather than definitive, considering the limited number
of research applications (primarily two surveys via Mirvis and
Kanter), large number of influences and consequent research variables
that must be considered in understanding cynicism, and the lack
of longitudinal data from which to draw reliable conclusions.</p>

<h3>Recommendations for Further Research</h3>
<p>
I recommend that more research be applied to verifying Mirvis'
and Kanter's findings, despite many of their findings sounding
quite intuitive and reasonable. I also suggest that this research
be system-based, that is, it should consider the organizations'
systems, structures and processes as they effect the output of
organization members.</p>
