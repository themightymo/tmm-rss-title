<h1>Work-Life Balance -- Balancing Your Work and Personal Life</h1>

<!--[index|Personal Wellness]-->

<p>The topic of work-life balance applies to a person's effort
to be effective in their worklife and in their personal life,
as well. This topic wasn't as important in the past as it is today
because, in the past, people often were able to attend primarily
to one major role in their life (for example, to working in &quot;the&quot;
company or housekeeping), rather than to several (for example,
to the current employer and one's career and being a mother and
being happy as an individual). Organizations are recognizing that,
to cultivate and support productive employees, the organization
must assist employees to learn how to achieve and maintain suitable
work-life balance.</p>
