  <p><i>Every man builds his world in his own image. He has the
  power to choose, but no power to escape the necessity of choice.</i><br />
  - Ayn Rand, philosopher</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept of authenticity has received a significant amount
of attention recently as people search for meaning and happiness,
particularly in their work lives. How one chooses to try to live
more authentically depends on their own perspective on authenticity.
Like many other popular concepts, different people have different
views about authenticity and many people feel very strongly about
their own views. Some people might assert that an individual is
being authentic if they are being completely honest and participating
in the here-and-now, eg, an honest conversation with a friend,
completely focused on cleaning out the garage, etc. There are
others who assert that authenticity involves many other features,
including, eg, always being centered with themselves and others,
living in a completely integrated fashion with their own values
and principles, always feeling complete meaning or sense of purpose
in their lives, etc.</p>

<p>The concepts of &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot;
can seem almost the same. However, the major philosophical movement
called existentialism has studied authenticity for centuries and
helps us understand more abut what authenticity is, along with
its relationship to the concept of meaning. Existentialists assert
that if an individual is not living authentically in their lives,
then they lose meaning and can fall into chronic anxiety, boredom
and despair. People might pursue &quot;quick fixes&quot; to avoid
the responsibility of living authentically, eg, quick fixes such
as anesthetizing themselves with alcohol or drugs, living in fantasies,
etc. Others might even assert that it's inauthentic to pursue
any approach (programs, books, etc.) that promises to help people
transcend (escape?) the responsibilities -- and sometimes drudgery
-- of day-to-day living.</p>

<p>Regardless of others' perspectives on authenticity, it's important for people 
  in management to live and work as authentically as possible -- a goal that is 
  usually often difficult to achieve, particularly in large organizations. As 
  mentioned above, how one chooses to live a more authentic life depends on their 
  perspective. A person might choose to appreciate more their own current approach 
  to life, or meditate on a regular basis, or journal (write down) their thoughts, 
  or engage in regular retreats, or sign up for a more complete program, etc.</p>
<h2><a name="remain" id="remain"></a>Major Benefits of Authenticity</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/"
target="_blank">Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Peter Block, in his book <em>Flawless Consulting, </em>asserts that authenticity 
  is one of the critical aspects of successful consulting (along with successfully 
  carrying out the phases of consulting). There are several reasons for the importance 
  of authenticity.</p>
<h3>1. Encourages clients to be open, honest and direct in the here-and-now. </h3>
<p>The collaborative consultant wants the client to be as open and honest as possible. 
  The consultant can encourage open and honest behavior in others by modeling 
  that behavior themselves. This helps the consultant to fully understand the 
  client and provide useful feedback that the client will hear, as well. </p>
<p>Authenticity from your client also provides extremely valuable feedback to 
  you. Frequently, you do not have sufficient opportunity to continually learn 
  about yourself, particularly in settings with your clients. Clients who choose 
  to be authentic around you are offering you a precious gift that can be used 
  by you to cultivate a collaborative consulting relationship with them and others.</p>
<h3>2. Builds client&#8217;s trust and confidence in your relationship.</h3>
<p>You can build a strong relationship with your client by showing them that you 
  trust them enough to be able to handle the truth. In turn, they will do the 
  same thing for you. Trust and confidence are critical ingredients for a successful 
  working relationship between you and your client. </p>
<h3>3. Deals with issues before the issues fester. </h3>
<p>When people express themselves honestly in the here-and-now, they are much 
  more likely to report issues as soon as they notice them. This ensures that 
  issues are addressed when they occur, rather than festering until they show 
  themselves as major forms of resistance to change during the project. </p>
<h3>4. Considers important &#8220;data&#8221; about the client&#8217;s situation.</h3>
<p>Information that you gather from your other senses is important data about 
  your client&#8217;s situation. The more open and honest that you can be about 
  your own perceptions, the more likely that the data from your senses will be 
  accurate. Many times that data can be used to more accurately understand your 
  client&#8217;s situation. </p>
<h3>5. Ensures organizational change efforts remain relevant, realistic and flexible.</h3>
<p>Plans rarely are implemented as planned. Authentic behavior from your clients 
  helps all parties involved to accurately perceive and talk about any changes 
  in the project so, as a result, plans can be updated with those changes and 
  thereby remain up-to-date. Perhaps Terry, in his book, <em>Authentic Leadership, 
  </em>puts it best: &#8220;authenticity self-corrects.&#8221; </p>
<h2><a name="key" id="key"></a>Key Guidelines to Authentic Behavior</h2>
<p>Block and various schools of psychology, for example, Carl Rogers&#8217; self-directed 
  therapy, describe the following core characteristics of authentic behavior. 
  Considering their descriptions, authentic behavior is more attainable than many 
  believe and it might help you to work easier rather than work harder in your 
  projects for change. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Honest -- Speak the truth. </li>
  <li>Direct -- Speak in terms that are clear, concise and focused.</li>
  <li> About here-and-now -- Speak about what is going on right now. </li>
  <li>From you -- Report your own experience of the here-and-now.</li>
  <li> Non-judgmental of others -- Speak about what you are experiencing around 
    others, not of your judgments of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless you are authentic in a supportive manner, clients might feel like you 
  are being aggressive. Aggressive behavior is perceived as demanding, forceful, 
  arrogant and even hostile. That can cause discomfort, alienation, confusion 
  and distrust between you and your clients. Experienced consultants have learned 
  to employ authentic communication in a manner that is completely honest, yet 
  remains supportive and respectful. </p>
<p>Note that authentic behavior does not always mean the consultant&#8217;s speaking 
  the truth about anything and everything all the time. Sometimes the consultant 
  senses that the client is not yet ready to hear about the consultant&#8217;s 
  speculations, for example, about causes of issues or the client&#8217;s role 
  in those issues. Sometimes these speculations would simply overwhelm and confuse 
  the client. <br />
  In every case, it is up to the consultant&#8217;s judgment as to how much they 
  &#8220;think out loud.&#8221; However, usually there is more of a downside to 
  not being authentic than the downside of sharing your thoughts and impressions 
  with your clients. </p>
