<h2>Description</h2>
<p>

The following framework can be filled in by readers to design
a logic model (or diagram) for their organization and for each
of its programs. Guidelines and examples are provided to help
the reader. This logic model is referenced from the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/outcomes-evaluation-guide.htm">Basic Guide to Outcomes-Based Evaluation for
Nonprofit Organizations With Very Limited Resources</a>.</p>
<h2>Purpose of a Logic Model</h2>
<p>

A logic model is a top-level depiction the flow of
materials and processes to produce the results desired by the
organization or program. The model can be very useful to organize
planning and analysis when designing the organization and its
programs or when designing outcomes-based evaluations of programs.
It can also be useful for describing organizations and programs
(for example, in grant proposals).</p>

<h2>What to Include and What Not to Include</h2>
<p>

Logic models can be in regard to whatever application in which
the designer chooses to use them. However, when using logic models
to analyze or describe organizations and programs, it's often
best to use logic models to depict major, recurring items in the
organization or programs -- rather than one-time items. For example,
you might not choose to do a logic model for the one-time, initial
activities to build an organization or program (constructing the
building, registering with state and federal authorities, etc.).
However, you might benefit more from using logic models to analyze
and describe the major, recurring activities that occur in the
organization or program (once they're built) to continue to produce
the results desired for clients and the community.</p>

<h2>Size and Level of Detail</h2>
<p>

The logic model should be of a size that readers can
easily study the model without extensive reference and cross-comparisons
between pages. Ideally, the logic model is one or at most two
pages long. The level of detail should be sufficient for the reader
to grasp the major items that go into an organization or program,
what occurs to those inputs, the various outputs that results
and the overall benefits/impacts (or outcomes) that occur and to
which groups of people.</p>

<p>Note the  content of program logic models is often more
specific than models for organizations. This level of specificity
is often quite useful for program planners.</p>

<h2>Definitions of Basic Terms</h2>
<p>

Logic models typically depict the inputs, processes,
outputs and outcomes associated with an organization and its programs.
Don't be concerned about your grasping the &quot;correct&quot;
definition of each of the following terms. It's more important
to have some sense of what they mean -- and even more important
to be consistent in your use of the terms.</p>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
These are materials that the organization or program takes
in and then processes to produce the results desired by the organization.
Types of inputs are people, money, equipment, facilities, supplies,
people's ideas, people's time, etc. Inputs can also be major forces
that influence the organization or programs. For example, the
inputs to a nonprofit program that provides training to clients
might include learners, training materials, teachers, classrooms,
funding, paper and pencils, etc. Various laws and regulations
effect how the program is conducted, for example, safety regulations,
Equal Opportunity Employment guidelines, etc. Inputs are often
associated with a cost to obtain and use the item -- budgets are
listings of inputs and the costs to obtain and/or use them.</p>

<h3>Processes (or Activities or Strategies or Methods)</h3>
<p>
Processes are used by the organization or program to manipulate
and arrange items to produce the results desired by the organization
or program. Processes can range from putting a piece of paper
on a desk to manufacturing a space shuttle. However, logic models
are usually only concerned with the major recurring processes
associated with producing the results desired by the organization
or program. For example, the major processes used by a nonprofit
program that provides training to clients might include recruitment
of learners, pretesting of learners, training, post-testing and
certification.</p>

<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p>
Outputs are usually the tangible results of the major
processes in the organization. They are usually accounted for
by their number, for example, the number of students who failed
or passed a test, courses taught, tests taken, teachers used,
etc. Outputs are frequently misunderstood to indicate success
of an organization or program. However, if the outputs aren't
directly associated with achieving the benefits desired for clients,
then the outputs are poor indicators of the success of the organization
and its programs. You can use many teachers, but that won't mean
that many clients were successfully trained.</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>
Outcomes are the (hopefully positive) impacts on those
people whom the organization wanted to benefit with its programs.
Outcomes are usually specified in terms of:<br />
a) learning, including enhancements to knowledge, understanding/perceptions/attitudes,
and behaviors<br />
b) skills (behaviors to accomplish results, or capabilities)<br />
c) conditions (increased security, stability, pride, etc.)</p>

<p>It's often to specify outcomes in terms of short-term, intermediate
and long-term.</p>

<h2>Basic Example of a Logic Model</h2>
<p>

The following example is intended to further portray
the nature of inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes.</p>

<p>The logic model is for an organization called the Self-Directed
Learning Center (SDLC).</p>

<p>Logic models for programs are often more detailed. Note that
the more comprehensive and descriptive your logic model</p>
