and Evaluation</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This document provides guidance toward basic planning and implementation
of an outcomes-based evaluation process (also called outcomes
evaluation) in nonprofit organizations. This document provides
basic guidance -- particularly to small nonprofits with very limited
resources.</p>

<p>NOTE: This free, basic, online guide makes occasional references
to certain pages in the United Way of America's book, <i>Measuring
Program Outcomes: A Practical Approach</i> (1996). That United
Way book is an excellent resource! However, it can be somewhat
overwhelming for nonprofits that have very limited resources.
This free online guide (that are reading now) can help nonprofits
carry out their own basic outcomes evaluation planning. This online
guide can also help small nonprofits to make the most of that
United Way book -- however, you <i>do not</i> have to have that
United Way book in order to carry out your own basic outcomes
evaluation plan by using this online guide. (Still, small nonprofits
are encouraged to get the United Way book, for example, to later
round out basic evaluation plans developed from this online guide
and/or to learn more than provided in this basic guide about outcomes
evaluation. To get the United Way book, call 703-212-6300 and
ask about item #0989.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Outcomes-based evaluation is but one type of evaluation
-- there are many types of evaluations. The reader would gain
deeper understanding about outcomes-based evaluation by reading
about the broader topic of evaluation. To do so, read <a href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Guide to Program Evaluation</a>. This online
basic guide about outcomes-based evaluation was designed by modified
the Basic Guide to Program Evaluation.</p>

<h2>Reasons for Priority on Implementing Outcomes-Based Evaluation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are decreasing funds for nonprofits</li>
  <li>Yet there are increasing community needs</li>
  <li>Thus, there is more focus on whether nonprofit programs are
  really making a difference -- and outcomes evaluation focuses
  on whether programs are really making a difference for clients</li>
  <li>Previous evaluation measures were on, for example, how much
  money spent, number of people served and on client satisfaction
  -- these measures don't really assess impacts on clients</li>
  <li>Outcomes evaluation looks at impacts/benefits to clients
  during and after participation in your programs</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor29824"></a>

<h2>Basic Principles for Small Nonprofits to Remember Before Starting</h2>

<p>Nonprofit personnel do not have to be experts in outcomes-based
evaluation in order to carry out a useful outcomes evaluation
plan.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In most major activities in life and work, there is a &quot;20%
  of effort that generates 80% of the results&quot;. This basic
  guide will give you the direction to accomplish that 20% needed
  to develop an outcomes evaluation plan for your organization.</li>
  <li>Once you've carried out the guidelines in this basic guide,
  you can probably let experience and funders help you with the
  rest of your outcomes evaluation planning, particularly as you
  implement your evaluation plan during its first year.</li>
  <li>In life (particularly for us adults), problems exist often
  because we&#146;re making things far too complex, not because
  we're making things far too simple. Often, people who are new
  to evaluation get &quot;mindcramp&quot;, that is, they think
  too hard about evaluation. It's actually a fairly simple notion
  -- just don't think so hard about it!</li>
  <li>Start small, start now and grow as you&#146;re able.</li>
  <li>Ready, fire, aim!</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />

<h2>What is Outcomes-Based Evaluation?</h2>

<h3>A Basic Definition</h3>

<p>As noted above, outcomes evaluation looks at impacts/benefits/changes
to your clients (as a result of your program(s) efforts) during
and/or after their participation in your programs. Outcomes evaluation
can examine these changes in the short-term, intermediate term
and long-term (we'll talk more about this later on below.)</p>

<h3>Basic Components and Key Terms in Outcomes Evaluation</h3>

<p>Outcomes evaluation is often described first by looking at
its basic components. Outcomes evaluation looks at programs as
systems that have inputs, activities/processes, outputs and outcomes
-- this system's view is useful in examining any program!</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Inputs</b> &#150; <br />
  These are materials and resources that the program uses in its
  activities, or processes, to serve clients, eg, equipment, staff,
  volunteers, facilities, money, etc. These are often easy to identify
  and many of the inputs seem common to many organizations and
  programs.</li>
  <li><b>Activities</b> &#150; <br />
  These are the activities, or processes, that the program undertakes
  with/to the client in order to meet the clients' needs, for example,
  teaching, counseling, sheltering, feeding, clothing, etc. Note
  that when identifying the activities in a program, the focus
  is still pretty much on the organization or program itself, and
  still is not so much on actual changes in the client.</li>
  <li><b>Outputs</b> &#150; <br />
  These are the units of service regarding your program, for example,
  the number of people taught, counseled, sheltered, fed, clothed,
  etc. The number of clients served, books published, etc., very
  often indicates nothing at all about the actual impacts/benefits/changes
  in your clients who went through the program -- the number of
  clients served merely indicates the numerical number of clients
  who went through your program.</li>
  <li><b>Outcomes</b> &#150; <br />
  These are actual impacts/benefits/changes for participants during
  or after your program<br />
  -- for example, for a smoking cessation program, an outcome might
  be &quot;participants quit smoking&quot; (notice that this outcome
  is quite different than outputs, such as the &quot;number of
  clients who went through the cessation program&quot;)<br />
  -- These changes, or outcomes, are usually expressed in terms
  of:<br />
  -- -- knowledge and skills (these are often considered to be
  rather short-term outcomes)<br />
  -- -- behaviors (these are often considered to be rather intermediate-term
  outcomes)<br />
  -- -- values, conditions and status (these are often considered
  to be rather long-term outcomes)</li>
  <li><b>Outcome targets</b> &#150; <br />
  These are the number and percent of participants that you want
  to achieve the outcome, for example, an outcome goal of 5,000
  teens (10% of teens in Indianapolis) who quit smoking over the
  next year</li>
  <li><b>Outcome indicators</b> &#150; <br />
  These are observable and measurable &#147;milestones&#148; toward
  an outcome target. These are what you'd see, hear, read, etc.,
  that would indicate to you whether you're making any progress
  toward your outcome target or not, for example, the number and
  percent of teen participants who quit smoking right after the
  program and six months after the program -- these indicators
  give you a strong impression as to whether 5,000 teens will quit
  or not over the next year from completing your program.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Take a few minutes and really notice the differences
between:<br />
-- Outputs (which indicate hardly anything about the changes in
clients -- they're usually just numbers)<br />
-- Outcomes (which indicate true changes in your clients)<br />
-- Outcome targets (which specify how much of your outcome you
hope to achieve)<br />
-- Outcome indicators (which you can see, hear, read, etc. and
suggest that you're making progress toward your outcome target
or not)</p>

<h2>Common Myths to Get Out of the Way Before You Start Planning</h2>

<h4>Myth: Evaluation is a complex science. I don&#146;t have time
to learn it!</h4>

<p>No! It&#146;s a practical activity. If you can run an organization,
you can surely implement an evaluation process!</p>

<h4>Myth: It&#146;s an event to get over with and then move on!</h4>

<p>No! Outcomes evaluation is an ongoing process. It takes months
to develop, test and polish -- <i>however,</i> many of the activities
required to carry out outcomes evaluation are activities that
you're either already doing or you should be doing. Read on ...</p>

<h4>Myth: Evaluation is a whole new set of activities &#150; we
don&#146;t have the resources</h4>

<p>No! Most of these activities in the outcomes evaluation process
are normal management activities that need to be carried out anyway
in order to evolve your organization to the next level.</p>

<h4>Myth: There&#146;s a &quot;right&quot; way to do outcomes
evaluation. What if I don&#146;t get it right?</h4>

<p>No! Each outcomes evaluation process is somewhat different,
depending on the needs and nature of the nonprofit organization
and its programs. Consequently, each nonprofit is the &quot;expert&quot;
at their outcomes plan. Therefore, start simple, but start and
learn as you go along in your outcomes planning and implementation.</p>

<h4>Myth: Funders will accept or reject my outcomes plan</h4>

<p>No! Enlightened funders will (at least, should?) work with
you, for example, to polish your outcomes, indicators and outcomes
targets. Especially if your's is a new nonprofit and/or new program,
then you very likely will need some help -- and time -- to develop
and polish your outcomes plan.</p>

<h4>Myth: I always know what my clients need &#150; I don't need
outcomes evaluation to tell me if I'm really meeting the needs
of my clients or not</h4>

<p>You don&#146;t always know what you don&#146;t know about the
needs of your clients &#150; outcomes evaluation helps ensure
that you always know the needs of your clients. Outcomes evaluation
sets up structures in your organization so that you and your organization
are very likely <i>always</i> focused on the current needs of
your clients. Also, you won&#146;t always be around &#150; outcomes
help ensure that your organization is always focused on the most
appropriate, current needs of clients even after you've left your
organization.</p>

<h2>Planning Any Type of Evaluation Includes Answers to These
Very Basic Questions</h2>

<p>Evaluation often seems like a &quot;heavy&quot;, complex activity
to those who are not familiar with the real nature of evaluation.
Actually, planning any kind of evaluation often requires answers
to some very basic questions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What decisions do you want to be able to make as a result
  of your evaluation?</li>
  <li>Who are primary audiences for the results?</li>
  <li>What kinds of info are needed?</li>
  <li>When is info needed?</li>
  <li>Where get that info and how?</li>
  <li>What resources are available to get the info, analyze it
  and report it?</li>
  <li>How report that info in useful fashion?</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor144337"></a>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 1: Getting Ready</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Read Step 1 (Chapter 1) of UW book <i>Measuring Program Outcomes:
  A Practical Approach</i> (1996) if you have it (otherwise, you'll
  still benefit from this section on this web page)</li>
  <li>You can very likely draft your own version of most of your
  outcomes evaluation plan and then have others review your drafts
  of those sections of the plan. (This &quot;short-cut&quot; approach
  to outcomes evaluation planning might be questioned by some experts
  on outcomes -- but then small nonprofits rarely have the resources
  to fully carry out the comprehensive and detailed steps often
  recommended by outcomes evaluation resources.)</li>
  <li>Remember that you don&#146;t have to be an expert to start
  the planning process -- each plan is different -- ultimately,
  you're the expert at your process and your plan</li>
  <li>Do consider getting a grant to support development of your
  plan, eg, maybe $3,000 to $5,000, particularly to have evaluation
  expertise to review your plans and your methods of data collection
  -- if you can't get this grant, you still can proceed with your
  plan</li>
  <li>DO tap the many resources available to help you (useful online
  resources are listed below)</li>
  <li>Now pick one program to evaluate that has a reasonably clear
  group of clients and clear methods to provide services to them
  -- in other words, make sure that you have a program to evaluate!</li>
  <li>NOTE: Soon, you should train at least one board member and
  staff member about outcomes -- consider using this very basic
  online guide</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor177348"></a>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 2: Choosing Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Note that a logic model for your program is depiction of
  inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes (short-term, intermediate
  and long-term) regarding your program. Take a look at the information
  in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_model" target="_blank"
  class="textlink">Introduction to Program Logic Model</a></li>
  <li>Reread the myths listed above &#150; don&#146;t worry about
  competing the &#147;perfect&#148; logic model &#150; ultimately,
  you&#146;re the expert here</li>
</ul>

<h3>Now Identify Your Outcomes (including short-term, intermediate
and long-term)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Now fill in a logic model for the program to which you want
  to apply outcomes-based evaluation -- see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/logic-model-guide.htm"
  class="textlink">the example logic model and framework</a> --
  BUT first read the next several bullets below in this section:</li>
  <li>To identify outcomes, consider: &#147;enhanced &#133;&#148;,
  &#147;increased &#133;&#148;, &#147;more &#133;&#148;, &#147;new
  &#133;&#148;, &#147;altered &#133;&#148;, etc.</li>
  <li>Note that it can be quite a challenge to identify outcomes
  for some types of programs, including those that are preventative
  (health programs, etc.), developmental (educational, etc.), or
  &quot;one-time&quot; or anonymous (food shelves, etc.) in nature.
  In these cases, it's fair to give your best shot to outcomes
  planning and then learn more as you actually apply your outcomes
  evaluation plan. Also seek help and ideas about outcomes from
  other nonprofits that provide services similar to yours. Programs
  that are remedial in nature (that is, that are geared to address
  current and observable problems, such as teen delinquency, etc.)
  are often easier to associate with outcomes.</li>
  <li>Start with short-term outcomes</li>
  <li>Regarding identifying short-term outcomes, think 0-6 months:<br />
  -- Imagine your client in the program or a day after leaving
  the program<br />
  -- What knowledge and skills do you prefer? Actually see?</li>
  <li>Regarding identifying intermediate outcomes, think 3-9 months:
<br />
  -- Imagine your client 3-9 months after leaving the program<br />
  -- What behaviors do you prefer? Actually see?</li>
  <li>Regarding long-term outcomes, think 6-12 months:<br />
  -- Imagine your client 6-12 months after leaving the program<br />
  -- What values, attitudes, status would you prefer to be the
  fullest extent of benefit for the client? Actually see?</li>
  <li>Now &#147;chain&#148; the short-term, intermediate- and long-term
  outcomes by applying the following sentence to them:<br />
  -- &quot;if this short-term occurs, then the intermediate occurs,
  and if this intermediate occurs, then this long-term occurs --
  AGAIN, don't worry about getting it perfect -- trust your intuition</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor177579"></a>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 3: Selecting Indicators</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Read Step 3 in UW book <i>Measuring Program Outcomes: A Practical
  Approach</i> (1996) if you have it (otherwise, you'll still benefit
  from this section on this web page) &#150; especially look at
  examples on pages 66-67.</li>
  <li>Identify at least one indicator per outcome (note that sometimes
  indicators are called performance standards)</li>
  <li>When selecting indicators, ask:<br />
  -- What would I see, hear, read about clients that means progress
  toward the outcome?<br />
  -- Include numbers and percent regarding the client's behavior
  , eg, &quot;2,000 of the participants (50%) of our participants
  will quick smoking by the end of the program&quot; and &quot;3,000
  of the participants (75%) of our participants will quick smoking
  one month after the program&quot;<br />
  -- If is your first outcomes plan that you've ever done or the
  program is just getting started, then don't spend a great deal
  of time trying to find the perfect numbers and percentages for
  your indicators</li>
  <li>Fill in your indicators in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/outcomes-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Outcomes-Based Evaluation
  Plan</a>. Also, carry over the outcomes you identified from the
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/logic-model-guide.htm"
  class="textlink">example logic model</a> to the basic evaluation
  plan.</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor177793"></a>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 4: Planning Data/Information</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Read Step 4 in UW book <i>Measuring Program Outcomes: A Practical
  Approach</i> (1996) if you have it (otherwise, you'll still benefit
  from this section on this web page) -- especially look at<br />
  -- Page 86 (+/-&#146;s of data sources) <br />
  -- Page 88 (major data collection methods)<br />
  -- Pages 90-93</li>
  <li>A useful resource at this point might be <a href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm#anchor1585345"
  class="textlink">Overview of Useful Methods to Collect Information</a></li>
  <li>Now might be the best time to get some evaluation expertise,
  for example, a consultant or utilize a local nonprofit service
  provider to help you review your drafted outcomes and indicators.
  The expert is also worth their &quot;weight in gold&quot; when
  reviewing methods to collect data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get Your Work Reviewed Now By Others</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you&#146;ve drafted outcomes and indicators yourself,
  get them reviewed by:<br />
  -- Board members<br />
  -- Staff<br />
  -- Client in program? Finished with the program?<br />
  -- Evaluation consultant?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identify Data Sources and Methods to Collect Data</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For each indicator, identify what information you will need
  to collect/measure to assess that indicator. Consider:<br />
  -- Current program records and data collection<br />
  -- What you see during the program<br />
  -- Ask staff for ideas</li>
  <li>Is it practical to get that data?<br />
  -- What will it cost?<br />
  -- Who will do it?<br />
  -- How can you make the time?</li>
  <li>When to collect data?<br />
  -- Depends on indicator<br />
  -- Consider: before/after program, 6 months after, 12 months
  after</li>
  <li>Data collection methods:<br />
  -- Questionnaires?<br />
  -- Interviews?<br />
  -- Surveys?<br />
  -- Document review?<br />
  -- Other(s)?</li>
  <li>Get evaluation consultant/expertise?</li>
  <li>Pretest your data collection methods (eg, have a few staff
  quickly answer the questionnaires to ensure the questions are
  understandable)</li>
  <li>Write a brief procedure to specify:<br />
  -- What data is collected?<br />
  -- Who collects it?<br />
  -- How they collect it?<br />
  -- When they collect it?<br />
  -- What do they do with it?</li>
</ul>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<p><a name="anchor178047"></a></p>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 5: Piloting/Testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If your's is a small nonprofit, then it's very likely that
  you don't have nearly the resources to invest in applying your
  complete outcomes evaluation process in order to test it out.</li>
  <li>In that case, then the first year of applying your outcomes
  process is the same as piloting your process.</li>
  <li>During the first year, notice problems and improvements,
  etc.</li>
  <li>Document these in your evaluations plan.</li>
  <li>If something happens to you so that you leave the organization,
  the organization should not have to completely recreate an outcomes
  plan. Be sure that write down any suggestions to improve the
  plan.</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor178333"></a>

<h2>Planning Your Outcomes Evaluation -- Step 6: Analyzing/Reporting</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Strongly consider getting evaluation expertise now to review,
  not only your methods of data collection mentioned above, but
  also how you can analyze the data that you collect and how to
  report results of that analyses.</li>
  <li>Before you analyze your data, <i>always</i> make and retain
  copies of your data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analyzing Your Data</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For dealing with numerical data with numbers, rankings:<br />
  -- Tabulate the information, i.e., add up the ratings, rankings,
  yes's, no's for each question. <br />
  -- For ratings and rankings, consider computing a mean, or average,
  for each question. <br />
  -- Consider conveying the range of answers, e.g., 20 people ranked
  &quot;1&quot;, 30 ranked &quot;2&quot;, and 20 people ranked
  &quot;3&quot;.</li>
  <li>To analyze comments, etc. (that is, data that is not numerical
  in nature):<br />
  -- Read through all the data<br />
  -- Organize comments into similar categories, e.g., concerns,
  suggestions, strengths, etc.<br />
  -- Label the categories or themes, e.g., concerns, suggestions,
  etc.<br />
  -- Attempt to identify patterns, or associations and causal relationships
  in the themes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting Your Evaluation Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Level and scope of information in report depends for whom
  the report is intended, e.g., funders, board, staff, clients,
  etc.</li>
  <li>Be sure employees have a chance to carefully review and discuss
  the report before sent out</li>
  <li>Funders will likely require a report that includes executive
  summary &#150; the summary should highlight key points from the
  evaluation, and not be a Table of Contents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example of Evaluation Report Contents</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Title Page (name of the organization that is being, or has
  a product/service/program that is being, evaluated; date)</li>
  <li>Table of Contents</li>
  <li>Executive Summary (one-page, concise overview of findings
  and recommendations)</li>
  <li>Purpose of the Report (what type of evaluation(s) was conducted,
  what decisions are being aided by the findings of the evaluation,
  who is making the decision, etc.)</li>
  <li>Background About Organization and Product/Service/Program
  that is being evaluated<br />
  -- a) Organization Description/History<br />
  -- b) Product/Service/Program Description (that is being evaluated)<br />
  -- -- i) Problem Statement (in the case of nonprofits, description
  of the community need that is being met by the product/service/program)<br />
  -- -- ii) Overall Goal(s) of Product/Service/Program <br />
  -- -- iii) Outcomes (or client/customer impacts) and Performance
  Measures (that can be measured as indicators toward the outcomes)<br />
  -- -- iv) Activities/Technologies of the Product/Service/Program
  (general description of how the product/service/program is developed
  and delivered)<br />
  -- -- v) Staffing (description of the number of personnel and
  roles in the organization that are relevant to developing and
  delivering the product/service/program)</li>
  <li>Overall Evaluation Goals (eg, what questions are being answered
  by the evaluation)</li>
  <li>Methodology <br />
  -- a) Types of data/information that were collected<br />
  -- b) How data/information were collected (what instruments were
  used, etc.)<br />
  -- c) How data/information were analyzed<br />
  -- d) Limitations of the evaluation (eg, cautions about findings/conclusions
  and how to use the findings/conclusions, etc.)</li>
  <li>Interpretations and Conclusions (from analysis of the data/information)</li>
  <li>Recommendations (regarding the decisions that must be made
  about the product/service/program)</li>
  <li>Appendices: content of the appendices depends on the goals
  of the evaluation report, eg.:<br />
  -- a) Instruments used to collect data/information<br />
  -- b) Data, eg, in tabular format, etc.<br />
  -- c) Testimonials, comments made by users of the product/service/program<br />
  -- d) Case studies of users of the product/service/program<br />
  -- e) Logic model<br />
  -- f) Evaluation plan with specified outcomes, sources to collect
  data, data collection methods, who will collect data, etc.</li>
</ul>
