<h1>Some Novel Notions for Support to Nonprofits</h1>

<!--[index|Training and Development]-->
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD, Authenticity Consulting, LLC</a>.</p>

<p>Many nonprofit service providers agree that nonprofits will experience
challenges and stresses unlike those experienced before. Experts cite changes
in funding (devolution, etc.), demographics, values, technology, etc. )
For a very good overview of these changes, see the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.us.kpmg.com/ps/march97/orgtrans.html%20" target="_blank">Peat
Marwick</a> report located at http://www.us.kpmg.com/ps/march97/orgtrans.html
). </p>

<p>As the nature of nonprofit leadership must change to accommodate changes
in the world, so must the nature of training and development programs. We
trainers and developers continue to assert that leaders must &quot;think
out of the box&quot;, but too many of us are still entrenched in our own
narrow views of training and development. </p>

<p>The following table depicts some rather novel forms of training and development
for nonprofits. </p>

<p><table width="550" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" HEIGHT=
"1437">
<tr>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="34%"><p align="center"><b>notion asked for from nonprofit executive directors</b>
</td>
<td width="59%"><p align="center"><b>purpose the idea would serve</b></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>incubator service</td>
<td>for new nonprofits to help them get off the ground until they are largely
self-sufficient; would included facilities and basic materials (plans, policies,
etc.)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>comprehensive assessment instrument </td>
<td>get perspective on overall situation; (see &quot;Organizational Fitness&quot;
topic in the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org">Nonprofit Managers'
Library</a>&quot;)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>one-time orientation on 1) role of E.D. and 2) systems overview of the nonprofit
organizations</td>
<td>establish firm knowledge and perspective on the role of the E.D., board
and organization; systems view conveys wise perspective on the ebbs and
flows of organizations</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>low-cost or free library of basic how-to information and materials needed
to run a nonprofit</td>
<td>provide highly affordable and therefore accessible resources for a firm
&#147;foundation&#148; of materials, to ensure appropriate structures, etc.
(this is done now with the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org">Nonprofit
Managers' Library</a>)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>ongoing E.D. training focused on systems view of nonprofit organization
(the interplay of major organizational functions)</td>
<td>provide a much more integrated and realistic perspective to leaders (than
typically done by one-shot courses) about their organizations so they are
better able to lead, diagnose and develop their organizations</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>seminars on E.D. &amp; board state-of-the-art topics</td>
<td>describe and discuss current and expected trends in nonprofit management</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>retreat center</td>
<td>many assert that nonprofit leaders quickly get burned out, yet few services
are provided to address burnout; a retreat center would provide yearly renewal,
reflection, action planning and follow-up (to be accountable to peers);
nonprofits leaders need &#147;emotional intelligence&#148; training, as
well</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>dialogue groups </td>
<td>for networking, ongoing reflection, to gain larger perspective and enhance
meaning; and cultivate skills in appreciate inquiry </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>highly focused, peer-based support and problem solving groups for ongoing,
low-cost problem solving and support</td>
<td>(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/circles/index.html">All About Circles</a>)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>consulting panels of local elders (wisdom circles)</td>
<td>one-time &#147;deep&#148; consulting and problem solving and &#147;centering&#148;;
integrates wisdom of community with community needs</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>cadre of &#147;certified&#148; nonprofit consulting professionals	</td>
<td>provide intensive organization development services to organizations in
trouble/pain; there are many consultants, but not enough who really understand
the nature of nonprofits, particularly small ones</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>workshops for service providers</td>
<td>train the trainers about nonprofits, holistic development, integrating interventions,
etc. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>emergency Helpline</td>
<td>provide prompt response and referral to highly stressed leaders; service
providers assert that nonprofits must collaborate but how many service providers
collaborate among themselves, e.g., to provide a Helpline?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>14</td>
<td>award &#147;certification&#148; to &#147;graduates&#148;</td>
<td>this would indicate levels of the consultants' proficiency to nonprofits
</td></tr>
