<h2>Designing Your Web Page -- Preparation</h2>
<p>
&middot; Your Web page is a communications tool -- it is not a product by
itself<br />
&middot; Therefore, plans to build a good Web page should be part of planning
for client services<br />
&middot; Websites are easy to build -- challenge is making it logical and
simple to follow<br />
&middot; First ask yourself some basic Web-planning questions:<br />
1. What do you want to accomplish?<br />
- Getting word out? (information-oriented, with &#147;contact us&#148; so
they can e-mail you)<br />
- Build mailing lists, etc.? (they provide information to you)<br />
- Building relationships? (interactive between you and Web page reader)<br />
- Earned income over the Internet? (e.g., selling books, &#147;e-commerce&#148;)<br />
- A specific interface to specific services? </p>

<p>2. Who is your intended audience?<br />
- &#147;What is my reader trying to solve?&#148;</p>

<p>3. Where will you get the necessary expertise? <br />
- Designing / drawing the page<br />
- Technically programming the page<br />
(this is not as hard as it used to be --<br />
use &#147;home made&#148; home pages)</p>

<p>4. Who will conduct client services?<br />
- Updating information on the page, etc.<br />
- Answering e-mail messages, etc.<br />
- Testing for broken links</p>

<h2>Naming Your Website</h2>
<h3>Pick a name (up to 24 characters?)</h3>
<p>&middot; Think long-term when picking a name<br />
&middot; Name should be descriptive of your organization&#146;s overall
services<br />
&middot; Pick a name that&#146;s easy to type in ...<br />
&middot; To register a name, go to http://www.networksolutions.com/ -- that
site will tell you if the name currently exists or not<br />
&middot; If you pick a name that substantially resembles someone else&#146;s,
they may sue you and have you remove the name</p>

<h3>Suffixes</h3>
<p>
&middot; &quot;.com&quot; identifies user as commercial entity<br />
&middot; &#147;org&quot; for non-commercial entities,<br />
&middot; &quot;gov&quot; for governmental bodies<br />
&middot; &quot;.edu&quot; for educational institutions, and <br />
&middot; &quot;.net&quot; for network services<br />
&middot; if outside the United States is usually an abbreviation for the
user&#146;s country</p>

<h2> Why Websites Fail</h2>
<p>
&middot; The following is based on the work of Michael Gilbert, editor of
the &#147;Nonprofit Online News&#148;<br />
&middot; He identifies five types of problems that Websites have<br />
1. 	Upside Down Site -- content is good but is buried under an impenetrable
hierarchy<br />
2.	Dead Website --  it&#146;s never updated. A variation is the Dead on
the Outside <br />
 ---- is updated, but you&#146;d never know it<br />
3.	Disconnected Website -- all the communication is one way, from the page
to you<br />
4.	Cool Website -- &#147;Las Vegas&#148; effect -- so enamored with technology,
it says nothing<br />
5.	Stingy Website -- gives nothing of value<br />
All of these problems are caused by focusing on the Website as a product
rather than means of client services</p>

<h2>Simple Guidelines About Page Format</h2>
<p>
&middot; Visit many Websites -- pick which ones you like and think about
why you like them<br />
&middot; Pay attention to their coloring scheme, placement of text and images<br />
&middot; Have short, simple pages <br />
&middot; Be consistent with images, colors and formatting of text<br />
&middot; Be careful (avoid?) use of scrolling text and images, and blinking
images<br />
&middot; Be careful (avoid?) background images<br />
&middot; Try get all images or text on a page to fit in one screen<br />
&middot; Don&#146;t overdue frames and graphics!<br />
&middot; Try put conclusions at the top of the page<br />
&middot; Have link to home page on every page<br />
&middot; Remember that diverse clients, countries, etc. are reading your
Web page<br />
&middot; Always tell visitors how to contact you<br />
&middot; Consider a &#147;site map&#148; - this tells users about the overall
arrangement of all of your pages<br />
&middot; Consider a &#147;table of contents&#148; or header at the top of
each page<br />
&middot; Test your page with several browsers, e.g., Netscape, Internet
Explorer, American Online and CompuServe -- try a laptop, too<br />
- Do color, images and text appear as you<br />
   preferred?<br />
- How long does it take to download your<br />
  page -- if more than five seconds, too long?<br />
&middot; Update your site regularly with new information -- announce updates<br />
&middot; Avoid &#147;Under Construction&#148;!<br />
&middot; Have someone review your site for you -- they get lost? any confusion?</p>

<h2>Simple Guidelines About Page Content</h2>
<p>
Here are Some Emerging Criteria for Evaluating Web Page Information:<br />
1.  Accuracy? - is the information really <br />
     believable?<br />
2.  Authority? - sound hollow? half-hearted?<br />
3.  Objectivity? - too much hype?<br />
4.  Current? - if anything is out of date, it all is<br />
5.  Coverage? - mention all of your services?</p>

<p>Think about your clients -- how do they speak? what do they value? what
would they want from your page? Write to that audience ...</p>

<p>Design for disabled client?  large fonts, minimal scrolling and clicking
...</p>

<h2>Simple Guidelines About Promoting Your Site</h2>
<p>
&middot; Announce your site to various search engines and directories<br />
- &#147;SubmitIt!&#148; at http://submit-it.com/<br />
- &#147;Postmaster2&#148; at http://www.NetCreations.com/postmaster/registration/try.html<br />
&middot; Monitor your traffic -- find out how many &#147;hits&#148; you&#146;re
getting per week<br />
&middot; Consider link relationships with other sites -- you link to them,
they link to you<br />
&middot; Use signature files -- mention your Website at the end of your
e-mail messages<br />
&middot; Join online newsgroups and participate -- your signature files
is spread all over<br />
&middot; Put your URL on all of your letterhead, invoices, business cards,
etc.<br />
&middot; Consider issuing a free newsletter (watch copyright terms, etc.)</p>
