<h2>Situations
When a Consultant is Useful</h2>

The following are typical situations when an organization might
need a consultant.<br />
1. The organization has no expertise in the area of need.<br />
2. The time of need is considered short-term, e.g., less than
a year, with a general start and stop time.<br />
3. The organization's previous attempts to meet their own needs
were not successful.<br />
4. Organization members continue to disagree about how to meet
the need and bring in a consultant to provide expertise or facilitation
skills to come to consensus.<br />
5. Leaders want an objective perspective, i.e., someone without
strong biases about the organization's past and current issues.<br />
6. A consultant can do work that no one else wants to do.<br />
7. An outside organization demands that a consultant be brought
in, e.g., a funder wants to ensure the organization is well suited
to spend the funder's money.<br />
8. The organization wants a consultant to lend credibility to
a decision that's already been made (this situation would be looked
at by many experienced consultants as highly unethical).<br />
<br />

<a name="anchor1893673"></a>
<h2>Where
to Get Consultants</h2>

1. Contact
professional associations, e.g., networks of organization development
practitioners, facilitators, trainers, fundraisers, accountants,
lawyers, computer users, etc.<br />
2. Contact local large corporations; they often have community
service programs and can provide a wide range of management and
technical expertise.<br />
3. Consult the local telephone company's Yellow Pages under the
category &quot;Consultant&quot; and &quot;Volunteering.&quot;<br />
4. Call a local university or college and speak to someone in
the college of Human Resources, Training and Development, or Business
Administration. <br />
5. Ask other organizations for ideas, particularly those that
have similar services and head-count size, for contacts and references.<br />
6. Nonprofits in Minnesota, see the &quot;Directory of Services
and Resources for Minnesota Nonprofits&quot; from the Minnesota
Council of Nonprofits (642-1904).<br />
(Note that nonprofits can often get consultants to provide services
on a pro bono basis. It's worth asking, especially if the consultant
is in strong agreement with the community's need for the nonprofit's
services.)<br />

<h2>How
You Can Make a Consultancy as Productive as Possible</h2>
<i>(This section includes advice
graciously provided by Barbara Davis, 317 South Hamline, St. Paul,
Minnesota 55105)</i>
<br />
1. Know what you want to do, and make sure your agency is prepared
for it.<br />
2. Try to reach internal agreement (board and staff) about the
consultancy.<br />
3. Don't become dependent on a consultant.<br />
4. If possible, don't limit the consultant to recommending action;
get the consultant involved in implementing recommendations.<br />
5. Fix causes, not symptoms.<br />
<br />

<h2>Getting
and Hiring the Best Consultant </h2>

<i>(This section includes
advice graciously provided by Barbara Davis, 317 South Hamline,
St. Paul, Minnesota 55105)<br /></i>
1. Give interested people
the information they need to understand your needs by using a
&quot;request for proposal&quot; (RFQ) or through direct conversation.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/smpl_rfq.htm">Sample Request for Proposal</a>.)<br />
2. Get a written proposal from every interested party. <br />
3. Get a bid on the fee and reimbursable expenses.<br />
4. Look at more than one proposal and examine them all carefully.<br />
5. Interview the best prospects and check their references. <i>(Consider
their extent of expertise, listening skills, ability to adapt
to the nature of your organization, ability to coach to ensure
the organization can address the problem in the future, etc.)</i><br />
6. Don't pick someone based only on price.<br />
7. Write a good contract including (see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/smplcntr.htm">Sample
Agreement for Services</a>):<br />
&middot; a list of &quot;deliverables&quot;<br />
&middot; a project completion date<br />
&middot; a payment schedule<br />
&middot; checkpoints at which you can evaluate programs<br />
&middot; a &quot;bail-out&quot; clause<br />
&middot; name of person in your agency who has the authority to
agree to expenditures or approve work<br />
&middot; agreement on reimbursable expenses<br />
&middot; understanding on who will do the actual consulting<br />

<h2>Additional
Advice</h2>

(orient consultant, evaluate project, avoid
IRS penalties)<br />
<h3>1. Help Consultants to Understand Your Organization:</h3>
There are a few basic techniques which can greatly help the consultant
to understand your organization, particularly if they are brought
in to work organization-wide and non-technical issues.<br />
<br />
<i>a) Help them understand your service(s), market(s) and stakeholder(s).</i>
For example, provide them copies of your strategic plans, budgets,
policies, most recent annual report, organization charts, and
advertising/promotions/sales literature. If there is a full range
of these types of documents, your organization probably values
careful documentation when making important decisions, and will
likely prefer the same from the consulting project. If these documents
appear to be very comprehensive and include a great deal of graphs,
figures, and numbers, your organization probably highly values
careful research, analysis, and conclusions, and will prefer the
same in the consultation project.<br />
<br />
<i>b) Give them a sense for the overall nature of your organization,</i> e.g.,
Are staff highly independent and work alone or do they prefer
working in teams? Do you go for consensus on decisions even if
it takes a long time to get or do you want timely closure on decisions?
Are their strong traditions you require based on the diversity
of your workforce? How does the staff feel about using consultants?<br />
<br />
<i>c) Give them a sense for the overall priorities of your organization,</i>
e.g., you might attempt to identify the general life stage of
your nonprofit, e.g., start-up, developing/building, stabilizing,
declining, etc. The stage will indicate your overall priorities,
as well, e.g., getting any help you can get, grabbing market share
and/or more clients and/or more revenue, developing a wide range
of careful documentation, divesting resources while ensuring client
needs are met, etc.<br />
<br />
<h3>2. Include Frequent Evaluations, Including Project Follow-Up</h3>
The extent of the consultant's and clients' participation in evaluating
the project is often an indicator of how much they really see
themselves responsible for the overall, long-term quality of the
consulting project.<br />
<br />
a) <i>The consulting project should be evaluated regularly</i>,
including briefly at the end of each meeting (about the process
used in that meeting), at mid-point in the planning effort, and
at its end. Specify in the contract that certain deliverables
(e.g., tangible products, such as reports, presentations, project
reviews, etc.) be delivered during the project. Ideally, the project
is evaluated at three months and six months after completion of
the project, particularly about whether the consultant's recommendations
were implemented or not and whether the project's goals were reached
or not.<br />
<br />
b) <i>Establish criteria early on from which the overall consulting
effort can be evaluated at the mid-point and end of the project.</i>
Establish criteria by having you and the consultant specify
what constitutes a successful consulting project and process.
Get descriptions to be as detailed as possible to later know if
the project was clearly a success or not.</p>

c) <i>Don't base evaluations mostly
on feelings</i>. Avoid this mistake by specifying, as much as
possible, <i>behaviors</i> that will reflect a successful consulting
project.<br />
<br />
<h3>3. If IRS Disagrees Service Provider is &quot;Independent
Contractor,&quot; You May Pay Penalties and Taxes</h3>
<i>The Issue</i><br />
A major, recent issue found during IRS audits is nonprofits arranging
to use what they term as &quot;independent contractors,&quot;
but what the IRS concludes are &quot;employees.&quot; In these
cases, the IRS demands the nonprofit pay back taxes and penalties.
Consequently, a client must be very careful when entering into
a relationship with a service provider to ensure the relationship
will be deemed an &quot;independent contractor&quot; relationship
by the IRS. <br />
<br />
<i>Background</i><br />
As background, one aspect of the arrangement between a client
and consultant is that the client typically does not have to pay
benefits and workers compensation, match Social Security payments,
and withhold income taxes. Consequently, the IRS is quite concerned
that clients accurately classify their service providers as &quot;employees&quot;
or &quot;independent contractors.&quot; There appears to be no
clear distinction between the two in the law, and each situation
is settled on a case-by-case basis. However, there are certain
guidelines a nonprofit can follow to minimize the likelihood that
IRS will deem a service provider to be an employee.<br />
<br />
<i>Guidelines to Minimize Likelihood of IRS Penalties and Taxes</i><br />
Whether a service provider is an employee or an independent contractor
depends primarily on the extent of control the client organization
has over the service provider: the less control in the relationship,
the less likely the IRS will deem the service provider an employee.
Consider the following actions when attempting to define the relationship
with an independent contractor:<br />
1. Carefully specify your relationship with the service provider
in a written document.<br />
2. The terms of the relationship (specific services, fees, project
start and stop dates, etc.) should all be specified in the contract.<br />
3. Attempt to arrange fees to be based on results or tasks, rather
than on time.<br />
4. In the document, specify the relationship to be with an independent
contractor who is responsible to pay their own taxes.<br />
5. The service provider should have all or considerable discretion
in how services are carried out, including the process and scheduling.
<br />
6. The service provider should be responsible to obtain and pay
for their own training to carry out the services.<br />
7. The service provider should not be required to carry out his
or her services at the offices of the client.<br />
8. The service provider should have or be making obvious efforts
to advertise and retain business with other clients.<br />
9. The service provider should have their own place of business.<br />
10. Note that the more a service provider appears as a manager
(i.e., makes operating decisions, supervises people, is responsible
for resource allocations, etc.), the more likely the service provider
will be deemed an &quot;employee&quot; by the IRS.<br />
