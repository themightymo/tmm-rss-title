<i>This sample Agreement for Services, or Contract, is for a project that
began with a Request for Proposal where the Great Scott Arts Association,
a new organization in Mosquito Falls, MN, was seeking a consultant or consultants
to assist in its initial set-up and in the analysis of possible administrative
and performing space.</i><br />
<br />
1. Terrific Consulting (hereafter called Contractor) agrees to provide the
following products and services to the Iceberg County Art Center (hereafter
called Client):<br />
<br />
A. Information gathering: Contractor will review the following information
compiled by Client:<br />
1). information on attendance at past events<br />
2). samples of past promotional pieces and any recent press coverage<br />
3). samples of past membership flyers<br />
4). financial information from the past three or four years<br />
<br />
Contractor will also inquire into the availability of any recent market
studies on the Iceberg area done by the city government or other groups
working on the Iceberg's economic development.<br />
<br />
Contractor will also confer by phone with the part-time coordinator and
two or three Client board members to get their view of the issues facing
Client.<br />
<br />
B. Member survey: Contractor will design a one-page membership survey. Client
will be responsible for duplicating the survey, sending it out to the membership
and tallying the responses.<br />
<br />
C. Contractor will design a &quot;community leader interview&quot; format.
Client's board members will call on community leaders and conduct interviews.
Contractor will summarize the finding and merge them with the survey responses,
giving Client a written report on how it is perceived by members and community,
and what people think it should be doing.<br />
<br />
D. Contractor will travel to Iceberg for a one-day stay to meet for half
a day with Client's board to discuss:<br />
1). the survey findings, Client's audiences or &quot;publics&quot;, Client's
&quot;position&quot; in the community, the &quot;messages&quot; that Client
wants to communicate to people, past promotional efforts and possible changes
to make in the future.<br />
2). the management training needs of Client's staff, board and committee
chairs. Contractor will present a format to use in writing job descriptions
and teach Client how to use it. The group will also develop an organizational
chart for Client, identifying the various committees, board officers, committee
chairs and others with particular management responsibilities.<br />
3). Client's fundraising needs and opportunities. Contractor will explore
how much Client wants to raise, and what Client is willing to do to raise
it, including Client's membership program, grant opportunities and the possibility
of more individual fundraising.<br />
<br />
E. Before leaving, Contractor will give some &quot;homework&quot; assignments
to Client. They would likely include preparation of some job descriptions
and a clear annual fundraising goal.<br />
<br />
F. Contractor will write:<br />
1) a regular promotional schedule based on the goals identified at the meeting
above<br />
2) a review of Client's job descriptions with suggested revisions<br />
3) recommended management training opportunities<br />
4) if feasible, an annual calendar of management tasks<br />
5) recommendations for raising more contributions<br />
<br />
This work will be completed no later than December 31, 1999, and will be
conducted by Contractors' agent, Edmund E. Expert.<br />
<br />
It is understood that circumstances arising during the consulting project
may require the activities described above to be replaced with other activities
of an equivalent value. Such changes will be based on mutual agreement of
both parties, which may be recorded as an addendum to this agreement, or
as a letter from one party to the other.<br />
<br />
2. Client agrees to:<br />
A. participate as requested in consulting activities. This includes calling
meetings, providing meeting sites and amenities, and providing information
requested by Contractor. Client's entire board will be involved in this
process, not just the coordinator. Client will also be asked to duplicate,
distribute and tally the results of a membership survey, to conduct communicate
leader interviews and to complete the homework assignments.<br />
<br />
B. pay Contractor a fee not to exceed $1,405,000 plus expenses. Expenses
to be billed include travel ($.25 per mile for auto travel), lodging and
meals while in Iceberg, long-distance phone calls, and any copying and mailing
services, outside of normal communication with Client. Lodging and meal
expenses will be documented with receipts.<br />
<br />
The payments will be made in three installments: $400,000 at the signing
of this contract; $400,000 upon completion of the Iceberg meeting described
above; and $605,000 upon completion of this project. The project will be
considered complete when the written report described above is submitted.<br />
<br />
C. authorize Amy Administrator to approve Contractor's work and any expenses
Contractor wishes to incur on behalf of Client.<br />
<br />
3. Either Party may terminate this agreement with thirty days' written notice.
If the agreement is terminated, Contractor will present Client with a statement
of account showing all fees paid to that time, and itemizing work performed.
If work performed exceeds fees paid to date, Client will pay Contractor
for such work at the rate of $40,000 an hour. If fees paid exceed work performed
to date, Contractor will return unearned fees to Client.<br />
