<p>The Great Scott Arts Association,
a new organization in Mosquito Falls, MN, is seeking a consultant or consultants
to assist in its initial set-up and in the analysis of possible administrative
and performing space. See the associated &quot;Agreement for Services&quot;
which would typically follow this proposal, assuming the client finds a
consultant that he or she likes and enters into an agreement with them.<br />
<br />
<h3>Situation </h3>
The GSAA was established in 1991 to assist several existing cultural groups
in Mosquito Falls and to promote and coordinate arts activities in the area.
Mosquito Falls is a town of 7500 people about 30 miles north of Saint Marvin,
on Highway 10. Cultural organizations in Mosquito Falls include a community
theater, community orchestra, the county historical society and a separate
history museum, a small concert series, a community art school and a Comprehensive
Arts Planning Program (CAPP) group, among others. To date, GSAA has nonprofit
and tax-exempt status and a board of directors, but no staff or office space.<br />
No maximum budget for the consultancy has been established at this time.<br />
<br />
<h3>Tasks to be accomplished</h3>
Continue development of the Association and plan for its future<br />
&middot; work with a task force of member organizations to determine what
joint needs the GSAA should address and how and to write GSAA by-laws<br />
&middot; implement a general membership structure and campaign<br />
&middot; design a GSAA newsletter and publish the first issues<br />
&middot; develop annual GSAA budget projections for three years<br />
<br />
Develop a building use plan (in concert with member organizations):<br />
&middot; determine organizations' individual space needs<br />
&middot; determine how space should best be used<br />
&middot; develop sample schedules of events to be held in the space<br />
&middot; develop recommendations on GSAA's role in operating the space,
if any<br />
&middot; develop a list of policy issues that should be dealt with before
any building is acquired (i.e., should tenant organizations pay rent? how
should space be allocated?)<br />
&middot; meet with representatives of other institutions interested in the
space to determine the feasibility of shared use<br />
<br />
Research possible funding sources for building remodeling and GSAA operations<br />
&middot; conduct the necessary library research to identify possible Minnesota
and national funding sources, both private and public<br />
&middot; gather guidelines from possible funders<br />
&middot; communicate with most likely funders to gauge their interest<br />
&middot; develop initial plans for seeking organizational and individual
funds from the Mosquito Falls community<br />
<br />
