<h1>Join / Form Peer Learning Group</h1>

<p>One of the most powerful and low-cost (even free) sources of
help is a peer learning group. You might join a current group
or form your own group -- often, it's much easier than you think.</p>

<p>Members in a group are considered to be peers because each
is equal in helping themselves and others to share ongoing support,
feedback, materials and accountability to get things done --and
learn at the same time.</p>

<p>Group members can meet face-to-face or by means of telecommunications
(via phone, email, Web, etc.). Also, members often can schedule
their own meetings and where those meetings will be held.</p>

<p>The format and process used by the peer group depends on the
purpose of the group, whether it be for goal attainment, problem
solving, training, support or networking. For example, peer groups
might be discussion groups, study groups or peer coaching groups.</p>

<p>Often, the best groups are small in size (6-10 members), keep
has the same members in each meeting, use a standard agenda, and
meet for a few hours at least once a month. Someone from outside
the group can be assigned to facilitate or all groups members
can take responsibility for facilitating. Some groups might decide
to have a different group member facilitate each meeting.</p>

<p>The following links are to additional resources about peer
learning, including about the many benefits, where you can learn
more, how to choose the best program, some organizations that
provide peer learning programs, and materials from which you could
form your own peer learning group.</p>

<h2>Form Your Own Peer Group</h2>

<p>To form your own group, first think about the purpose or application
of the group. Usually, there are two major different kinds of
groups:<br />
1) Those where all members learn about the same topic or skill
(training groups), for example, around a common topic in the Free
Management Library. <br />
2) Those where members address the same problem/goal or each addresses
their own (coaching groups). For example, Tom works on strategic
planning, Susan works on time management, Jack works on career
development, etc.</p>

<p>In a training group, you would gather any 6-8 people who are
interested in the same topic or skill. In a coaching group, you
would gather 6-8 people, ideally who have similar roles or positions
in their life and/or work.</p>
