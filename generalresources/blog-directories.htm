<h2>About Business Blogs</h2>

<p>Before you look at any of the lists of blogs later on below,
it might be useful for you to understand what is involved in writing
a blog or even consider doing your own blog. See<br />

<p><b>NOTE:</b> We don't include links to individual, specific
blogs below. There are just too many -- and too many don't survive
past their first year. Instead, we only include links to indices
of blogs, that is, links to organizations that maintain lists
of individual blogs. If you want to publicize your blog, we recommend
that you submit them to one or more of the indices below.</p>

<h2>Indices of Blogs -- Sites That List and Categorize Numerous
Blogs</h2>

<p>The number of blogs has exploded over the past several years.
Many blogs do not last past the first year. Consequently, it's
quite difficult to identify and monitor individual blogs for this
Library.</p>

<p>Instead, the following list is to numerous services that monitor
and organize blogs into relevant categories. Some of the services
also list how long certain blogs have existed and how many visitors
that blog receives each day.</p>

<p>Search the various categories to find several blogs in which
you are interested. You might select individual blogs based on
how long they have lasted and how many visitors regularly visit
that blog.</p>
