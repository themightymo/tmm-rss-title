<h1>Free, Online Discussion Groups</h1>

<p>One of the most convenient means to get quick, useful advice is to join a free, online discussion
  group in which to pose your questions.  There are 1,000s of these groups and that number
  continues to grow rapidly.  There are a variety of names for the groups, for example,
  listservs, egroups and eforums.  Some people have strong feelings about which name should be used
  and why the names are different. Usually, groups have a home page which includes description of the 
  purpose of that group, and how you can participate in it. <br />
  <br />Groups use a wide range of technologies to support discussions.
  One of the first types was Usenet, or newsgroups, usually having
  names with words separated by periods, e.g., "alt.activism" or "soc.org.nonprofit."
  Often, these groups need special types of news readers, many of which are available for free
  on the Internet.  (The following link might be helpful, <a class="textlink" href="http://www.newsfeeds.com/" target="_blank">usenet groups</a>.  
  Also see <a class="textlink" href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/finding-groups/general.html" target="_blank">finding groups</a>.)  
  More recently, new customized software packages make it even easier to find the best newsgroups for you
  and help you to participate in them.
  <br />
  <br />The following lists by no means includes all groups. However, many of the major 
  ones are listed below. New ones are often announced in some or all of the 
  following, as well.
