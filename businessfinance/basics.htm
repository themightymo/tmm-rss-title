<h2><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description</h2>
<p>The following basic overview will give you some overall perspective
on the basic processes involved in financial management in small
for-profit businesses in the United States. Key terms to learn
are bolded. You'll learn more about the key terms later in subsequent
sections when you return to</p>

<p>The following activities described on this page occur regularly
as part of the yearly <b>accounting cycle</b>. The accounting
cycle includes bookkeeping, generating financial statements and
analyzing information from the statements.</p>

<p>NOTE: Sole proprietorships do not have boards of directors,
whereas corporations do. Therefore, any mention of boards of directors
in the following, pertains to corporations.</p>

<h2><a name="basic" id="basic"></a>Basic Bookkeeping Activities</h2>
<p>Bookkeeping is basically recording various financial transactions.
Bookkeeping activities can often by done by someone who's doing
basic clerical work in the business.</p>

<h3>Fiscal Policies and Procedures Manual (or Accounting Procedures
Manual)</h3>

<p>As your business grows, it helps to develop a set of procedures
for how your business manages its finances, including how the
following activities are carried out by your business. You and
your employee will be able to work from the manual to carry out
financial management activities. You can also hire a finance professional
to review the manual to ensure it's up to date.</p>

<h4>Type of Accounting System and Recording of Financial Transactions</h4>

<p>Accounting starts with basic <b>record keeping (or bookkeeping)</b>.
When your organization is just getting started, your bookkeeping
system will probably be based on what's called a <b>cash-basis
accounting system</b>, rather than <b>accrual-basis system</b>.
Many organizations, when starting out, use the cash-basis system
and a checkbook to track transactions. In the &quot;memo&quot;
portion of the checkbook, they note if the amount depicted on
the check is an expense or revenue, and where the amount came
from or is going to. As your organization grows, you'll begin
using ledgers to track transactions, for example, you'll <b>post</b>
cash receipts to a <b>cash receipts journal</b> and checks you
write to a <b>cash disbursements</b> journal.</p>

<p>As your nonprofit grows and as you begin using the accrual
method, you'll likely need more types of journals, for example,
a Cash Receipts Journal, Cash Disbursements Journal, Payroll Journal,
Accounts Receivable Ledger, Accounts Payable Ledger, Sales Journal,
Purchases Journal and General Ledger.</p>

<p>(In an accrual-basis system, you post entries when you earn
the money and when you owe it. Small organizations usually do
not have the resources to use an accrual-based system. However,
financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis. As a compromise,
many organizations use the cash-based basis to record entries
in journals, but get help to convert to an accrual-based basis
to generate financial statements.)</p>

<p>You can do postings using a <b>single-entry</b> or <b>double-entry
method</b>. Double-entry works from a basic accounting equation
&quot;assets = liabilities + capital&quot;. The double-entry method
makes sure that your books are always in balance. Every transaction
has two journals entries, a <b>debit</b> and a <b>credit</b>.
Each transaction effects both sides of the equation.</p>

<p>You'll post your cash disbursements in a <b>journal of entry</b>.
Each posting might refer to accompanying documents that you keep
in a file somewhere. For example, postings about cash receipts
might refer to invoices that you sent to a customers which prompted
them to write checks to your business (checks which you posted
cash receipts). For example, postings about cash disbursements
might refer to invoices that were sent to your business which
prompted you to write checks (checks which you posted as cash
disbursements.) When you make a deposit to the bank, you'll file
the bank's deposit receipt in a file.</p>

<p>Other record keeping might include posting (probably in an
accounts receivable journal) what people owe you (<b>accounts
receivable</b>), (and posting in an accounts payable journal)
what you owe other people (<b>accounts payable</b>) and posting
in another type of journal what <b>assets</b> (inventories, cash,
facilities, equipment, etc.) you own. This information will also
be used to compute and pay your <b>taxes</b> at the end of the
year.</p>

<h4>Manual or Automated Accounting System</h4>

<p>Your initial record keeping system will probably be based on
a manual system (where you make entries and total them by hand)
or you might use a computer system. You might even choose to outsource
your record keeping system to another business that manages your
bookkeeping activities (along with other financial management
activities) for you.</p>

<p>A computer-based system greatly automates entry of transactions,
updating of ledgers, generation of financial statements and financial
analysis (more on these later), and generation of reports needed
for filing taxes, etc. The only drawback to using a computer is
that you might underestimate the importance of knowing how your
accounting processes really work -- that's an advantage of doing
the bookkeeping yourself, if only for a few months. You should
also generate your own financial statements and financial analysis
at least for a couple of months. Having this knowledge and experience
helps you develop an instinct for getting the most out of your
financial resources.</p>

<p>(We'll talk more about that back in the topic , after we've
reviewed the rest of the information on this page.)</p>

<h4>Accounts and Chart of Accounts</h4>

<p>You'll post each entry according to the category, or <b>account</b>,
of the transaction. Each account will be associated with an <b>account
number</b>. These numbers are referenced when developing your
financial statements (more on those later). You'll refer to a
<b>chart of accounts</b> which will tell you what account number
to use when you post an entry. You can design your own chart of
accounts, including coming up with your own account numbers. The
chart should organize account numbers in the general categories
of assets, liabilities, capital, income, and expenses. The account
numbers you come up with should depend on the particular kinds
of revenues and expenses you expect to have most frequently.</p>

<h4>Budgets (Financial Forecasting)</h4>

<p>You'll have a an <b>operating budget</b> (or <b>annual
budget</b>), which shows planned revenue and expenses,
usually for the coming year. Budget amounts are usually divided
into major categories, for example, salaries, benefits, computer
equipment, office supplies, etc. You might also have <b>cash budgets</b>,
which depicts the cash you expect to receive and pay over the
near term, for example a month. You also might have <b>capital
budgets</b>, which depict expenses to obtain or develop, and operate
or maintain major pieces of equipment, for example, buildings,
automobiles, computers, furniture, etc. Development of the budgets
is usually driven by the chief executive. In the case of corporations,
the board treasurer can take a strong role in developing and presenting
the budget to the rest of the board. The board is responsible
to authorize the yearly budgets.</p>

<p>Usually, each month (after you've done trial balancing -- more
on that later), you'll update your budget report to include actual
revenue and expenses. Then you can compare your planned revenue
and expenses to your actual revenue and expenses. This will give
you a good idea whether your operating according to plan or not,
including where you need to cut down on expenses and build up
on revenue.</p>

<h4>Petty Cash</h4>

<p>You'll have a lot of small, recurring expenses that you'll
need to pay right away, for example, to buy a computer power cord,
stamps, etc. You'll probably work from a <b>petty cash</b> fund.
You might establish this fund by writing a check to the fund,
and noting on the check that it goes to the &quot;petty cash&quot;
fund. You'll withdraw from the fund by filling out a voucher that
describes who took the money, how much, for what and on what date.</p>

<h4>Trial Balances</h4>

<p>Usually, once a month, you'll <b>do trial balances</b>. This
activity usually starts by totaling the entries from the journal(s)
into a <b>general ledger</b>. (As your business grows,
you may use other types of ledgers, too, for example for equipment,
payroll, etc.) When using double-entry accounting, you'll add
up totals on both sides of the ledger to make sure that total
debits equal total credits.</p>

<p>You'll make sure that the individual postings and totals are
correct by comparing each to its accompanying documentation. For
example, your recording of cash disbursements will be compared
to your bank's monthly checking statement that indicates what
checks you wrote over the month. Your recording of cash disbursements
will also be compared to accompanying invoices and other forms
of billing to your business, to verify there was a need for each
check that was written to pay bills.</p>

<h4>Internal Controls</h4>

<p>You will have various forms of <b>internal controls</b> to
ensure the business is following its plans, minimize the likelihood
of mistakes, avoid employee thefts, etc. There are a wide range
of internal controls. For example, you'll be careful about whom
you hire. You might have authorization lists about who can access
which areas of the building, types of information, etc.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, you'll carry over totals to various financial
reports, including your budget, to see if your financial activities
are according to plan or not. To minimize employee theft, the
business's mail will be opened by one person who logs in each
check that is received. This person will be someone other than
the person who deposits the checks to the bank. Disbursements
of large amounts, for example, over $500, may require a secondary
signature, for example, from the board treasurer in the case of
corporations.</p>

<p>Another form of financial control is an <b>audit</b>. An audit
is a comprehensive analysis, by a professional from outside the
business, of your financial management procedures and activities.
The auditor produces a report, with a variety of supplements,
that indicates how well your business is managing its resources.
It's usually good practice to have an audit, whether you're required
to or not.</p>

<h2><a name="state" id="state"></a>Financial Statements</h2>
<p>In order to know how your business is doing, you'll do some
ongoing financial planning and analysis. In this planning and
analysis, you'll likely use your bookkeeping information to produce
various financial statements, including a cash flow statement,
and profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement and a balance sheet.</p>

<p>Your <b>cash flow statement</b> depicts changes in your cash during the year. 
  Your <b>profit and loss statement</b> depicts the changes in your assets over 
  the past year. This statement is particularly useful to tell you if you are 
  operating with extra money or at a deficit. This gives you a pretty good impression 
  of your rate of revenues and spending. It signals areas of concern, as well. 
  Your <b>balance sheet</b> depicts the overall value of your business at a given 
  time (usually at the end of the year), including by reporting your total assets, 
  subtracting your total liabilities and reporting the resulting net assets. Investors 
  often want to see the balance sheet. You'll learn a lot more about financial 
  statements, including examples, later on back in the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor561142">

<h2><a name="anal" id="anal"></a>Financial Analysis</h2>
<p>By themselves, numbers usually don't mean much. But when compare
them to certain other numbers, you can learn a lot about how your
business is doing. For example, you can compare the planned expenses
depicted on your budget to your actual expenses in order to see
if your spending is on track.</p>

<p>Another form of comparison is by using ratios. A ratio is a
comparison made by mathematically dividing one number by the other.
The interpretation of results from various types of comparisons
depends on the nature of the business. For example, a wholesale
business might have different types and ranges of expenses than
a retail business. You'll learn a more about financial analysis
back in the topic 
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor558944">

</p>

<h2><a name="report" id="report"></a>Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>The types of frequency of reports depend on the nature of the
business and its situation. For example, if the business is in
some sort of crisis, management, bankers, etc., may require frequent
reports of various types.</p>

<p>In the case of corporations, your board typically will require
regular financial reports at each board meeting. When your business
just gets started, the chief executive might prepare and present
financial reports to the board. When the business develops, a
board finance committee can be a big help. The committee, led
by the board treasurer, ensures that reports are complete and
helps present them to other members of the board.</p>

<p>The board may require a cash flow statement, profit and loss
statement and balance sheet at each meeting. They also may request
descriptions of finances for upcoming, major initiatives. They
may request information prior to filing taxes. They will certainly
need to see any results from financial audits. You'll learn a
more about financial reporting back in the topic
