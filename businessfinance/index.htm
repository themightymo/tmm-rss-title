<h1>All About Financial Management in Business</h1>

<!--[index|Financial Management (For-Profit)]-->
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter 
  McNamara, MBA, PhD</a><br />
Applies to for-profits unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>New business leaders and managers have to develop at least
basic skills in financial management. Expecting others in the
organization to manage finances is clearly asking for trouble.
Basic skills in financial management start in the critical areas
of cash management and bookkeeping, which should be done according
to certain financial controls to ensure integrity in the bookkeeping
process. New leaders and managers should soon go on to learn how
to generate financial statements (from bookkeeping journals) and
analyze those statements to really understand the financial condition
of the business. Financial analysis shows the &quot;reality&quot;
of the situation of a business -- seen as such, financial management
is one of the most important practices in management. This topic
will help you understand basic practices in financial management,
and build the basic systems and practices needed in a healthy
business.</p>

<h3>Role of Treasurer and Board Finance Committee</h3>

<p>If your small business is a corporation, you would do well
to find someone experienced in financial management and encourage
them to be your board treasurer (your board chair has this responsibility
to find someone suitable, as well). Therefore, it's important
to understand the role of the board treasurer. <br />

<h3>Getting an Accountant or Bookkeeper, If Needed</h3>

<p>If you are inexperienced in financial management, then you
should get an accountant initially to help you set up your bookkeeping
system, generate financial statements and do some basic financial
analysis. But don't count on an accountant to completely take
over your responsibility for financial management! The accountant
can help you set up a bookkeeping system, generate financial statements
and analyze them, but you have to understand financial data to
the extent that you can understand the effects of your management
decisions, the current condition of your business and how decisions
will effect the financial condition of your business in the future.

to Look for When Hiring an Accountant</a></p>

<p>You should carefully consider whether you should hire an outside

attention to the hiring of independent contractors.<br />

<h3>Buy Accounting Software to Help You?</h3>

<p>Strongly consider getting a software package to manage your
books! There are a number of very useful software packages that
will help you automate bookkeeping, generation of financial statement
and their analysis. Note that an accounting software package can
greatly reduce the time to enter and manage accounting transactions,
and generate financial statements. However, you still should have
at least a basic understanding of the accounting process for your
organization, including what journals are used and what general
accounts exist. You must have good understanding of financial
statements and how to analyze them -- an accounting package cannot
do this for you!<br />

<h3>Getting a Bank and Banker</h3>

<p>You'll need to start a business account at a bank. Probably
the best way to find a good bank is to ask for advice and references
from other small businesses, especially those that are of the
size and nature of yours. If you're just starting out, you probably
don't have much money. You may be able to get buy with a non-interest-bearing
checking out that has no, or minimal, fees. The following links

<h3>Classification of Accounts (for Chart of Accounts)</h3>

<p>In accounting, different types of financial transactions (eg,
paying telephone bills, copier bills, getting money from sales,
getting money from interest income, etc.) are assigned specific
numbers (account numbers) which help to record and track those
types of transactions. Businesses might create their own list
(or chart) of accounts or adopt a chart used by other organizations.
In any case, you should have some basic impression of a chart
of accounts. The following links will help you. <br />

<h2>Addressing Financial Controls and Risk Management</h2>

<p>Financial controls exist to help ensure that financial transactions
are recorded and maintained accurately, and that personnel don't
unintentionally (or intentionally) corrupt the financial management
system. Controls range from very basic (eg, using a checkbook
and cash register tapes to more complex, eg, yearly financial
audits). <br />

<h2>CRITICAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN YEARLY ACCOUNTING CYCLE</h2>

<p>Now that you have a basic sense of the overall accounting and
financial management process, we'll look at the key parts at the
beginning of the overall process, including budgeting, managing
cash and credit.</p>

<p><a name="anchor123"></a></p>

<h2>Financial Planning</h2>

<p>Financial planning works from the strategic and business plans
to identify what financial resources are needed to obtain and
develop the resources to achieve the goals in the two types of
plans. Typically, financial planning results in very relevant
and realistic budgets -- budgets are addressed later on in this
topic. So be sure to consider business planning for each of your
products and services.</p>

<h2>Budgeting and Managing a Budget</h2>

<p>A budget depicts what you expect to spend (expenses) and earn
(revenue) over a time period. Amounts are categorized according
to the type of business activities, or accounts (for example,
telephone costs, sales of catalogs, etc.). Budgets are useful
for planning your finances and then tracking if you're operating
according to plan. They are also useful for projecting how much
money you'll need for a major initiative, for example, buying
a facility, hiring a new employee, etc. There are yearly (operating)
budgets, project budgets, cash budgets, etc. The overall format
of a budget is a record of planned income and planned expenses
for a fixed period of time. <br />

<h2>Managing Cash Flow</h2>

<p>As a new business, your biggest challenge is likely to be managing
your cash flow -- probably the most important financial statement
for a new business is the cash flow statement. The overall purpose
of managing your cash flow is to make sure that you have enough
cash to pay current bills. Businesses can manage cash flow by
examining a cash flow statement and cash flow projection. Basically,
the cash flow statement includes total cash received minus total
cash spent. Cash management looks primarily at actual cash transactions.

<h3>Managing Your Checking Account</h3>

<p>For a new business, your check register very likely will be
your primary means to record and track cash. Whether yours is
a new business or an established business, you'll need to know
how to manage your bank account. See<br />

<h2>Budget Deviation Analysis</h2>

<p>You learned above that a budget depicts what you expect to
spend (expenses) and earn (revenue) over a time period. Budget
deviation analysis regularly compares what you expected, or planned,
to earn and spend with what you actually spent and earned. The
budget deviation analysis can help greatly when detecting how
well you're tracking your plans, how much to accurately budget
in the future, where there may be upcoming problems in spending,
etc. A budget deviation analysis report might include columns
with titles:</p>

<p><table width="738" height="72" border="0" cellspacing="0" 
cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">Planned for Month</td>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">Actual for Month</td>
    <td width="25%">

    (planned minus actual)</td>

<h2>ACTIVITIES IN YEARLY ACCOUNTING CYCLE: Financial Statements
and Analysis</h2>

<p><a name="anchor561142"></a></p>

<h2>Financial Statements</h2>

<p>To really understand the current and future conditions of your
business, you have to look at certain financial statements. These
statements are generated by organizing and analyzing numbers from
your accounting activities. You should understand the two primary
financial statements, the Profit and Loss Statement (or Income
Statement) and the Balance Sheet. (Some sources believe that there
are other primary statements, too, such as the cash flow statement
or change in capital, etc. However, the Income Statement and Balance
Sheet are the two standard statements for any business.) The following
links will give you an overview of these two key statements, and
we'll soon get into them in more detail later on below. Here are
several perspectives on the statements. <br />

<h3>Profit and Loss (Income) Statements</h3>

<p>These &quot;P and L&quot; statements depict the status of your
overall profits. These statements include much money you've earned
(your revenue) and subtract how much you've spent (your expenses),
resulting in how much you've made money (your profits) or lost
money (your deficits). Basically, the statement includes total
sales minus total expenses. It presents the nature of your overall
profit and loss over a period of time. Therefore, the Income Statement
gives you a sense for how well the business is operating. <br />

<h3>Balance Sheets</h3>

<p>Whereas the P and L statement depicts the overall status of
your profits (or deficits) by looking at income and expenses over
a period of time, the balance sheet depicts the overall status
of your finances at a fixed point in time. It totals your all
your assets and subtracts all your liabilities to compute your
overall net worth (or net loss). This statement are referenced
particularly when buying or selling a business, or applying for
funding. Here are several perspectives. <br />

<h2>Financial Analysis</h2>

<p>Financial analysis can tell you a lot about how your business
is doing. Without this analysis, you may end up staring at a bunch
of numbers on budgets, cash flow projections and profit and loss
statements. You should set aside at least a few hours every month
to do financial analysis. Analysis includes cash flow analysis
and budget deviation analysis mentioned above. Analysis also includes
balance sheet analysis and income statement analysis. There are
some techniques and tools to help in financial analysis, for example,
profit analysis, break-even analysis and ratios analysis that
can substantially help to simplify and streamline financial analysis.
How you carry out the analysis depends on the nature and needs
of you and your business. The following links will help you get
a sense for the &quot;territory&quot; of financial analysis.</p>

<h3>Break-Even Analysis</h3>

<p>The break-even analysis uses information from the income statement
and cash flow statements to compute how much sales much be accomplished
in order to pay for all of your fixed and variable expenses. Fixed
expenses are expenses that you'd have regardless of the level
of sales of products or services (eg, sales, rent, insurance,
maintenance, etc.). Variable expenses are incurred according to
the level of sales of products or services (eg, sales commissions,
sales tax, freight to ship products, etc.). Break-even analysis
can help you when projecting when you'll make a profit, deciding
how much to charge for a product, setting a sales goal, etc. <br />
