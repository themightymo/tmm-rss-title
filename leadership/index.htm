<p>Leading is about setting direction and ensuring that that direction
is followed. Leading can apply to leading oneself, other individuals,
groups, organizations and societies. The nature of how leading
is done depends on the context of the situation, one one's perspective,
and on the nature and needs of those involved. There is a rich
history and body of research regarding leadership. This module
aims to make that accessible to you.</p>

<h2><center>INTRODUCTION</center></h2>

<a name="anchor102113"></a>
<h2>How to Approach This Topic</h2>

<h3>Leadership -- Very Human Activity -- and as Diverse and Robust
as any Human Activity</h3>

<p>Many people today are seeking to understand -- and many people
are writing about -- the concepts and practices of leadership.
There are a great many reasons for the strong popularity of the
topic, including that people, groups and organizations are faced
with changes like never before. Effective leadership is required
to understand and navigate through the many changes.</p>

<p>There has been an explosion of literature about leadership
lately. Leading is a very human activity -- we're all human --
so there are many people who consider themselves experts on leadership.
Unfortunately, many people make strong assertions about leadership
without ever really understanding a great deal about leadership.
Understanding leadership requires more than reading a few articles
or fantasizing about what great leaders should be. The contents
of this topic aim to give the reader a broad understanding of
the background, contexts and approaches to leadership.</p>

<p>The reader might best be served to explore the topic of leadership
by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, by getting a basic sense of the system of an organization,
  including its functions and roles, and how they are integrated.
  See the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/org_thry/org_thry.htm"
  class="textlink">Introduction to Organizations.</a></li>
  <li>Next, get a basic sense of the functions of management (leading
  is one of them) and how they are integrated in order to lead
  an organization. See the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Introduction to Management.</a></li>
  <li>Next, scan the topics in this topic of leadership in order
  to realize that there are definitions of leadership, different
  theories and models and traits of leadership, and different domains
  of leadership -- each domain requiring different competencies
  or qualities in order to lead in that domain.</li>
  <li>Finally, get a sense for how your abilities in leadership
  can be developed in an informal or formal way. See the topic
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/development/index.htm" 
  class="textlink">Leadership Development.</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Learn How to Read Literature About Leadership</h3>

<p>Before you proceed to understand more about leadership, you
might read about:<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/development/understanding.htm">Leadership
Cube -- The Many Dimensions of Leadership</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/development/literature.htm">Guidelines
to Understanding Literature About Leadership</a></p>

<p>NOTE: Some people use the term &quot;leadership&quot; (the
capability to lead) to refer to governance or executive management
(both are roles in an organization). If you're seeking information
about those roles, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/chiefexecutives/index.htm"
class="textlink">Chief Executive Role</a> and/or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm"
class="textlink">Boards of Directors</a>.</p>

<a name="anchor103654"></a>
<h2>What's a Leadership Theory vs.
Model vs. Style?</h2>

<p>Leadership is often explained by using these terms. In the
context of explaining leadership, the terms can be quite confusing
because they are used interchangeably. Here's how you might think
of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A philosophy is a broad, general belief or set of beliefs.
  For example, many describe &quot;servant leadership&quot; as
  a philosophy or practice (there's more about servant leadership
  in this Library topic).</li>
  <li>A theory is a suggestion or speculation about why something
  is occurring and it might be based on a variety of philosophies,
  i.e., &quot;when this happens, then the following happens&quot;
  or &quot;in this situation, the following is best to have or
  to do .&quot; For example, the traits theory suggests that certain
  features are needed in someone to be a great leader.</li>
  <li>A model is description of how something happens or should
  happen - it often is depiction of a certain theory. For example,
  the Situational Leadership Model (Blanchard and Hershey) depicts
  a situational theory of leadership, and depicts when to tell,
  sell, participate or delegate.</li>
  <li>A style is the nature of how someone acts when enacting a
  certain theory or model, e.g., to be autocratic, participative
  or laissez-fair (hands off) in leadership style.</li>
</ul>

<h2><center><a name="anchor293932"></a>DEFINITIONS OF LEADERSHIP</center></h2>

<a name="anchor160512"></a>
<h2>Definitions of Leadership</h2>

<p>Many people believe that leadership is simply being the first,
biggest or most powerful. Leadership in organizations has a different
and more meaningful definition. Very simply put, a leader is interpreted
as someone who sets direction in an effort and influences people
to follow that direction -- the people can be oneself, another
individual, a group, an organization or a community. How they
set that direction and influence people depends on a variety of
factors that we'll consider later on below.</p>

<p>Here's another definition:<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/leadership/2010/04/06/leadership-defined/" target="_blank">Leadership
Defined</a><br />
<a href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leader/leadcon.html">Concepts
of Leadership</a><br />

target="_blank">Leadership (an Introduction)</a></p>

<p>To really comprehend the &quot;territory&quot; of leadership,
you should briefly scan some of the major theories, notice various
styles of leadership and review some of the suggested traits and
characteristics that leaders should have. The rest of this library
should help you in this regard.</p>

<h2>Is Leading Different than Managing?
(Pros and Cons)</h2>

<p>Traditional views of management associate it with four major
functions: planning, organizing, leading and controlling/coordinating.
However, many educators, practitioners and writers disagree with
this traditional view.</p>

<a name="anchor508177"></a>
<h3>Views that Leading is Different
Than Managing</h3>

<p>The following articles offer views different from the traditional
view that leading is a major function of management.<br />

the Delicate Balance Between Leadership and Management</a></p>

<a name="anchor508500"></a>
<h3>View That Separating &quot;Leading&quot;
from &quot;Managing&quot; Can Be Destructive</h3>

<p>Another view is that to be a very effective member of an organization
(whether executive, middle manager, or entry-level worker), you
need skills in the functions of planning, organizing, leading
and coordinating activities -- the key is you need to be able
to emphasize different skills at different times.</p>

<p>Yes, leading is different than planning, organizing and coordinating
because leading is focused on influencing people, while the other
functions are focused on &quot;resources&quot; in addition to
people. But that difference is not enough to claim that &quot;leading
is different than managing&quot; any more than one can claim that
&quot;planning is different than managing&quot; or &quot;organizing
is different than managing&quot;.</p>

<p>The assertion that &quot;leading is different than managing&quot;
-- and the ways that these assertions are made -- can cultivate
the view that the activities of planning, organizing and coordinating
are somehow less important than leading. The assertion can also
convince others that they are grand and gifted leaders who can
ignore the mere activities of planning, organizing and coordinating
-- they can leave these lesser activities to others with less
important things to do in the organization. This view can leave
carnage in organizations. Read:<br />

<h2>DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LEADERSHIP <br />
AND THE COMPETENCIES / QUALITIES NEEDED IN EACH</h2>

<a name="anchor601114"></a>
<h2>Understanding Leadership Competencies
and Qualities</h2>

<h3>Challenge of Identifying Competencies Needed by Leaders</h3>

<p>The particular competencies (knowledge, skills and abilities)
or qualities that a person needs in order to lead at a particular
time in an organization depend on a variety of factors, including:<br />
1) Whether that person is leading one other individual, a group
or a large organization;<br />
2) The extent of leadership skills that person already has;<br />
3) That person's basic nature and values (competencies should
be chosen that are in accordance with that nature and those values);<br />
4) Whether the group or organization is for-profit or nonprofit,
new or long-established, and large or small;<br />
5) The particular culture (or values and associated behaviors)
of whomever is being led.</p>

<p>The above considerations can make it very challenging when
trying to determine what competencies someone should have in order
to be a better leader. Perhaps that's why leadership training
programs in institutions typically assert a set of standard competencies,
for example, decision making, problem solving, managing power
and influence, and building trust.</p>

<h3>Don't Get Hung Up On Categories -- Different People Will Categorize
Topics Differently</h3>

<p>If the reader had the opportunity to review a variety of leadership
development programs, he or she would notice a wide variety of
approaches to categorizing topics. Don't get hung up on the &quot;right&quot;
way to categorize the topics.</p>

<h3>Competencies Are Cumulative from Leading Individuals to Organizations</h3>

<p>Leading in successively larger contexts (from individuals to
groups to organization-wide efforts) requires successively larger
sets of competencies. For example, &quot;core&quot; competencies
are the minimum needed in leading others, whether other individuals,
in groups or organization-wide efforts. To really be effective
at leading other individuals, one should have the core competencies
plus certain other competencies to lead individuals, etc</p>

<a name="anchor326128"></a>
<h2>Understanding and Using Competency
Models</h2>

<p>A competency model is an integrated approach, a framework,
that can be used to identify the competencies (new knowledge,
skills and abilities) and qualities required by leadership in
various contexts. Consider the following articles.</p>

<h2>Core Competencies to Lead In
Any Domain</h2>

<p>Whether you're leading yourself, others, teams, organizations
or communities, there are certain skills that you need to have.
Certainly, there's a wide variety of perspectives on which skills
to have, but most people would probably believe the following
are necessary. Other core competencies are listed later on in
this overall topic, especially in regard to certain domains.</p>

<h2>Domain: Leading Groups and
Teams</h2>

<p>Note that some experts believe that the dynamics of a collection
of about 12 people or less is quite different than a collection
of 12 or more -- 12 or more becomes more like what we think of
as an &quot;organization&quot; with a distinct culture. Many people
think of a &quot;team&quot; as apart from a group -- they think
of a team as a collection of people with a specific purpose and
organized to achieve certain goals.</p>

<p>Remember that the competencies and qualities that are required
to lead groups and teams also require that a person can effectively
lead themselves and other individuals. So be sure to read the
above sections about those topics.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Perspectives on Leadership</h2>

<p>Before reading and of the following, it's important to get
a sense of the overall &quot;territory&quot; of leadership, so
be sure to at least scan the sections of topics (listed at the
top of this page). There is a great deal of anecdotal information
about leadership -- much of it more in the realm of spiritual
development than leadership. It's insufficient to learn about
leadership merely by reading a few articles.</p>
