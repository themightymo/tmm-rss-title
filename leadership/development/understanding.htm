<h1>Understanding All Aspects of Leadership - 20 Different Perspectives on Leadership</h1>

<!--[index|Leadership]-->

<h2>Great Confusion About the Term &quot;Leadership&quot;
Today</h2>
<p>Discussions about leadership today have become so frequent and impassioned 
  that they have become almost evangelical in tone. Leading is a very human activity 
  -- everyone's human -- so everyone's got lots of advice about leading. Leadership 
  development has almost become spiritual development, rather than professional 
  development. In our advice, we associate any desirable trait to what leaders 
  should be. It's difficult to publish a book about business with having the term 
  &quot;leadership&quot; in the title. While this trend has reminded us of the 
  critical importance of leadership and sometimes greatly inspired us on to greater 
  achievements in life and work, it also has diffused the concept of leadership 
  to the extent that the term has become almost useless in really helping people 
  to become more effective in organizations.</p>

<h2>Leadership Cube <font size="-2">(TM)</font></h2>

<p>
Different people tend to talk about leadership from many
different perspectives and not even realize that they are doing
so. It is very simplistic to generalize about leadership as if
the term applies the same way in every situation. Understanding
the concept of leadership requires more than reading a few articles
or fantasizing about what great leaders should be. To really understand
leadership, one must understand &quot;Leadership Cube.&quot; The
Cube represents at least 20 different perspectives on leadership.</p>

<p>The Cube includes the following dimensions: <br />
1) five domains of leadership<br />
2) two contexts of leadership<br />
3) two orientations of leadership</p>

<p>Imagine each of these 3 dimensions along one side of a box,
or cube. That would produce a cube with 20 smaller cells (5 times
2 times 2 = 20). Each of the 20 cells represents a unique perspective
on leadership. You might consider some or all of the cells the
next time that you use the term &quot;leadership&quot; in your
studies, writings, research, discussions, etc.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
    Relationship-oriented</td> 
    <td width="50%">
    Participation, empowerment, relationships, etc.</td> 
  </tr>

<p>NOTE: The orientation of leadership is adapted from the Hersey-Blanchard situational 
  model of leadership in &quot;Management of Organizational Behavior: Utilizing 
  Human Resources&quot;, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1982.</p>
