<h2>Spirituality in the Workplace - What is Spirituality at Work?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/spirituality/contacting-linda-ferguson/" target="_blank">Linda 
  Ferguson</a></p>
<p>In my travels around the country providing workshops on the topic of working 
  spiritually, I&#8217;ve found consistently that people are looking for ways 
  to have their work make a difference and to feel energized in a richer way in 
  their work. I want to explore here a few ways that you might examine spirituality 
  in your work. </p>
<p>I provide a framework in my first book, &#8220;Path for Greatness&#8221;, for 
  aligning your gifts, passion and purpose so you can be of service for the world. 
  (to see more about my book on Spirituality at Work go to: http://www.amazon.com/Path-Greatness-Work-Spiritual-Service/dp/1552124983/ref=tmm_pap_title_0 
</p>
<p>First idea to explore is &#8211; what feeds you spiritually? You need to continually 
  till your spiritual soil so that you can keep energized and inspired. Take some 
  time now and write down 3 things you do each week or every day to renew yourself.</p>
<p>Second, what does spirituality mean to you? What three words do you use to 
  describe times when you feel spiritual? See how you can integrate those words 
  and ideas into your work day. In my workshop I have people write out all the 
  words they can to describe a spiritual experience. Those words may include joy, 
  peace, bliss, serenity etc. I then ask, &#8216;Would you like to work in a place 
  that has this?&#8217; To a person, they all say yes. </p>
<p>OK then, how do you help create this in your work? What small step can you 
  take to bring such feelings into your workplace? Please share your ideas here 
  on this post of how you work spiritually or how you&#8217;ve seen others do 
  this.</p>
<p>Three words that I like to use for working spiritually are: wholeness, meaning 
  and connection. When we feel a sense of our own wholeness, we come from a place 
  of greater authenticity and energy. We generally find greater meaning in what 
  we do when we are doing it for a larger purpose than feeding ourselves or our 
  organization. Think of how you can be your best FOR the world.</p>
<p>Finally, when we connect to others in a deeper way, we often feel greater compassion 
  or joy in our relationship with them. We can strengthen all that we do when 
  we connect with our own Source of inspiration, in whatever ways we connect with 
  this Source.</p>

  Bower</a></p>
<p>Research shows the impact spirit in the workplace can have for individuals 
  and organizations. Here are five key outcomes that everyone can benefit from:</p>
<p> <strong>Boosts morale.</strong> Engaging in practices that support spirit 
  in the workplace can uplift the spirits of everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>Influences satisfaction. </strong>Since spirit in the workplace encourages 
  each individual to bring their whole self to both work and home, it increases 
  the satisfaction level in both areas.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthens commitment.</strong> Being aligned with an organization 
  that fosters the essence of who you are enables you to feel and display a tremendous 
  sense of loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Increases productivity. </strong>When you feel a greater sense of connection 
  to your work, you are more motivated to produce good work. Which in turn increases 
  the overall productivity of an organization.</p>
<p><strong>Improves the bottom line. </strong>According to a nation-wide study 
  on spirituality in the workplace, organizations which integrate another bottom-line 
  into its practices &#8211; like spirituality &#8211; actually increase the financial 
  bottom-line. These organizations believe that spirituality could ultimately 
  be the greatest competitive advantage.</p>
<p>For example, Southwest Airlines is often described in terms that would identify 
  it as a spirit-driven organization. This was the only airline to be profitable 
  after the September 11th tragedy that had an incredible financial impact on 
  the airline industry and continues to remain profitable. They have a triple 
  bottom line &#8211; People, Performance &amp; Planet. &#8220;It takes a lot 
  of dedication, perseverance, and hard work to do the right thing for our Customers, 
  Employees, and Planet. We began operations in 1971 with a revolutionary idea 
  that everyone should be able to afford to fly instead of drive and to enjoy 
  the Safety, comfort, and convenience of air travel. For the past 38 years, we 
  have devoted ourselves to meeting that goal. &#8221;</p>
<p>Since 1987, when the Department of Transportation began tracking Customer Satisfaction 
  statistics, Southwest has consistently led the entire airline industry with 
  the lowest ratio of complaints per passengers boarded. Many airlines have tried 
  to copy Southwest&#8217;s business model, and the Culture of Southwest is admired 
  and emulated by corporations and organizations in all walks of life.</p>
<p>According to their Southwest Cares Report: Doing the Right Thing, &#8220;To 
  better understand why we at Southwest try to do the right thing, it is important 
  to understand how we do business and how we integrate our Core Values into everything 
  we do. It is the Southwest Culture that sets us apart.</p>
<p>The 35,000+ Employees of Southwest Airlines are the heart and soul of our Company. 
  Doing the right thing for these Employees includes providing them with a stable 
  work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth. As 
  we &#8220;Live the Southwest Way,&#8221; our Employees are recognized through 
  several Employee recognition programs for the hard work and caring Spirit they 
  show to each other and our Customers. Not only do we work hard with what we 
  call a Warrior Spirit, we work smart.&#8221; Part of living the Southwest way 
  is also by having a servant&#8217;s heart and a fun LUVing attitude.</p>
<h2><a name="reasons" id="reasons"></a>Reasons for the Spirituality in the Workplace 
  Movement</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/spirituality/contacting-janae-bower/" target="_blank">Janae 
  Bower</a></p>
<p>There are many reasons that contribute to this movement around spirit in the 
  workplace. Here are a few reasons I&#8217;ve found on why it began.</p>
<p>Employees want more from their organizations and organizations demand more 
  from their employees. With all the corporate downsizing and restructuring, employees 
  who are left tend to work longer hours. As a result, they want to bring more 
  of their outside self to work. As organizations continue to struggle to find 
  and keep talented employees, they need to offer more than just &#8220;a job.&#8221; 
  Employees yearn to feel part of a mission, to add value and to contribute in 
  a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Previous movements in the 1980&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s such as the new age, 
  work/life balance, simplicity and others have paved the way for this one as 
  well as newer ones like the green movement.</p>
<p>Different generations are contributing to it as well. The majority of the population, 
  78 million baby boomers, are reaching mid-life and looking at spiritual issues 
  such as: What is my legacy? What is my purpose? What is really important to 
  me? Generation Xers are driven toward a what&#8217;s-in-it-for-me mentality 
  and are willing to make organizational changes to meet those needs for work-life 
  balance. Generation Y is the other dominate generation with 76 million. This 
  value-based, team-focused generation is influencing the workplace in many positive 
  ways, one being wanting flexible workplaces that provide meaning and growth 
  opportunities.</p>
<p>In general it is also a reflective time in society as we experienced the first 
  decade of the millennium. As we are living this momentous time in history, society 
  as a whole is reflecting on matters related to spirituality, ethics and humanity.</p>

<h2>Spirituality Beyond the Workplace - Getting to What Matter Most</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/spirituality/contacting-janae-bower/" target="_blank">Janae 
  Bower</a></p>
<p>Have you figured out how to get the heart of what matters most amidst the chaos 
  of our overstuffed lives? Lately I&#8217;ve been using this affirmation as a 
  reminder in my pursuit of what is most important in my work and life. &#8220;I 
  make time for what matters most.&#8221; This affirmation helps me to know that 
  while I can&#8217;t get to everything that I want to on my daily to do list, 
  I am intentionally carving out time for those most critical things each day. 
  Sometimes that includes making time for being and not doing.<br />
  Stephen Covey refers to this concept as his third habit to put first things 
  first. For Brendon Burchard, author of Life&#8217;s Golden Ticket, it&#8217;s 
  about living each day fully by being able to say yes to these three questions. 
  &#8220;Did I live? Did I love? Did I matter?&#8221; Val Kinjerski, PhD, shares 
  another perspective of how important it is to fight for what really matters. 
  Check her out as she speaks about it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAlT4g7kQdE/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I determine what matters most:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Finding IT:</strong> How to Lead with your Heart. First you have 
    to discover what matters most to YOU by finding the deeper meaning, joy, and 
    purpose of life.</li>
  <li><strong>Living IT: </strong>How to Create and Live an Inspired Life. Next 
    you need to decide how you&#8217;ll live. When you understand how to live 
    the inspired life principles from the insideout, you will learn how to live 
    your life the way you ought to be; full and richly.</li>
  <li><strong>Giving IT </strong>Away: How to Make a Difference. The final aspect 
    is to determine your legacy. How will you be inspired to leave your mark by 
    giving away your time, talent and treasures to serve others and be part of 
    something larger than yourself?</li>
</ul>
