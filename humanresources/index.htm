<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a name="anchor7214"></a>
<h3>Human Resources Applies to Any Size
of Organization</h3>

<p>
<a href="#anchor7214">This Topic Applies to Any Size of Organization</a></p>

<p>All organizations have people -- they have human resources.
Regardless of the size of an organization or the extent of its
resources, the organization survives -- and thrives -- because
of the capabilities and performance of its people. The activities
to maximize those capabilities and that performance are necessary
regardless of whether the organization refers to them as Human
Resource Management, Human Resource Development or Human Resources
-- or has no formal name for those activities at all.</p>

<p>Those activities are the responsibility of all people in the
organization. Thus, members of organizations, regardless of size
or resources, will benefit from using the resources referenced
from this topic.</p>

<a name="anchor7860"></a>
<h3>Human Resource Guidelines Apply to
For-Profits and Nonprofits</h3>

<p>
<a href="#anchor7860">These Human Resource Guidelines Apply
to For-Profits and Nonprofits</a></p>

<p>The vast majority of resources in this topic apply to nonprofits
as well as for-profits. There's a misconception that there is
a big difference in managing human resources in for-profit versus
nonprofit organizations. Actually, they should managed similarly.
Nonprofits often have unpaid human resources (volunteers), but
we're learning that volunteers should be managed much like employees
-- it's just that they're not compensated with money; they're
compensated in other ways. Managing volunteers is very similar
to paid staff -- their roles should be carefully specified, they
should be recruited carefully, they should be oriented and trained,
they should be organized into appropriate teams or with suitable
supervisors, they should be delegated to, their performance should
be monitored, performance issues should be addressed, and they
should be rewarded for their performance. Also, organizations
should consider the risks and liabilities that can occur with
volunteers, much like with employees. So nonprofit organizations
should consider the resources in this topic as well.</p>

<a name="anchor8103"></a>
<h3>Clarifying Some Terms -- Human Resource
Management, Human Resources, HRD, Talent Management</h3>

<p>The <b>Human Resource Management (HRM) function</b> includes
a variety of activities, and key among them is responsibility
for <b>human resources</b> -- for deciding what staffing needs
you have and whether to use independent contractors or hire employees
to fill these needs, recruiting and training the best employees,
ensuring they are high performers, dealing with performance issues,
and ensuring your personnel and management practices conform to
various regulations. Activities also include managing your approach
to employee benefits and compensation, employee records and personnel
policies. Usually small businesses (for-profit or nonprofit) have
to carry out these activities themselves because they can't yet
afford part- or full-time help. However, they should always ensure
that employees have -- and are aware of -- personnel policies
which conform to current regulations. These policies are often
in the form of employee manuals, which all employees have.</p>

<p>Some people distinguish a difference between HRM and <b>Human
Resource Development (HRD), a profession</b>. Those people might
include HRM in HRD, explaining that HRD includes the broader range
of activities to develop personnel inside of organizations, e.g.,
career development, training, organization development, etc.</p>

<p>The HRM function and HRD profession have undergone tremendous
change over the past 20-30 years. Many years ago, large organizations
looked to the &quot;<b>Personnel Department</b>,&quot; mostly
to manage the paperwork around hiring and paying people. More
recently, organizations consider the &quot;HR Department&quot;
as playing a major role in staffing, training and helping to manage
people so that people and the organization are performing at maximum
capability in a highly fulfilling manner. There is a long-standing
argument about where HR-related functions should be organized
into large organizations, eg, &quot;should HR be in the Organization
Development department or the other way around?&quot;</p>

<p>Recently, the phrase &quot;<b>talent management</b>&quot; is
being used to refer the activities to attract, develop and retain
employees. Some people and organizations use the phrase to refer
especially to talented and/or high-potential employees. The phrase
often is used interchangeably with HR -- although as the field
of talent management matures, it's very likely there will be an
increasing number of people who will strongly disagree about the
interchange of these fields.</p>

<p>Many people use the phrase &quot;Human Resource Management,&quot;
&quot;Human Resource Development&quot; and &quot;<b>Human Resources</b>&quot;
interchangeably, and abbreviate Human Resources as <b>HR</b> --
HR has become a conventional term to refer to all of these phrases.</p>

<p>Thus, this Library uses the phrase &quot;Human Resources&quot;
and the term &quot;HR,&quot; not just for simplicity, but to help
the reader to see the important, broader perspective on human
resources in organizations -- what's required to maximize the
capabilities and performance of people in organizations, regardless
of the correct phrase or term to be applied when doing that.</p>

<h2>Role of Human Resources Function in Organizations</h2>
<h3><a name="ask" id="ask"></a>Ask HR-What is it like to work in HR</h3>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>

<p>A question I frequently get from those individuals outside of HR is, &#8220;What 
  is it like to work in HR?&#8221; Well, the answer to that question can vary 
  greatly by HR professional and organization. </p>
<p>Human Resources (HR) can include a broad spectrum of specialties within organizations. 
  Some examples of specialties include recruiting, payroll, policy, safety, training 
  and development, and performance management. In smaller organizations, the HR 
  professional may handle all of those specialties and in larger organizations, 
  each specialty is most likely its own department. </p>
<p>The roles within HR can vary greatly as well as with many departments from 
  the purely administrative to the executive. Another related and perhaps more 
  important question that is often discussed is, &#8220;what should HR be doing?&#8221; 
  For me, HR&#8217;s primary purpose is to ensure that the right people are working 
  in the right places to accomplish the organization&#8217;s goal. </p>
<p>In other words, HR is responsible to develop programs that will attract, select, 
  develop, and retain the talent needed to meet the organizational mission. So 
  whether you are an HR department of one or a combination of multiple departments 
  that include hundreds of employees, your primary responsibility is talent management. 
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick test to see if your programs are aligned and focused on 
  the primary purpose of HR. See if you can answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the primary mission of the organization?</li>
  <li>What talent is needed to meet the mission?</li>
  <li>Which programs do you have in the following areas:<br />
    Identifying and Attracting Talent?<br />
    Selecting and Hiring Talent?<br />
    On boarding Talent?<br />
    Developing Talent?<br />
    Retaining Talent?</li>
  <li>How is program success measured?</li>
  <li>In what areas do we need to improve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can&#8217;t answer these questions, you have some work to do.</p>

<h2>Challenges Facing Human Resources Function</h2>
<h3><a name="seven" id="seven"></a>If You Want a Seat at the Table, Learn the 
  Business </h3>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>

<p>In many companies HR does not occupy a seat at the strategic planning table. 
  Who&#8217;s to blame?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is hotly debated and often clear lines are drawn 
  between those in HR and those in other functions. Many HR professionals blame 
  the leaders for not seeing the value of their function to the organization, 
  while some managers see HR as the roadblock to doing what needs to be done.</p>
<p>In a 2005 article written by Fast Company Magazine&#8217;s Keith Hammonds, 
  Keith purports all the reasons &#8220;Why We Hate HR.&#8221; If the title itself 
  isn&#8217;t enough to put a HR professional on the defense, then providing the 
  declaration that &#8220;HR people aren&#8217;t the sharpest tacks in the box&#8221; 
  as the first reason certainly will. His assertion in the article is that those 
  who enter the HR field are not business people and are ill-equipped to understand 
  business. He quotes a Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) study that 
  identified which coursework HR professionals found most beneficial to their 
  success in the field to support his message that the majority of those working 
  in the field do not see understanding business as necessary to their success. 
  The results showed that coursework in communications, business law, and ethics 
  were most beneficial.</p>
<p>A recently released SHRM survey of HR leaders indicates the same finding. The 
  respondents in the U.S. indicated that strategic thinking is one of the top 
  five competencies needed for senior HR leaders; however, business knowledge 
  was not listed. While the lineage of the field of HR coupled with the introduction 
  of legislation to protect employers may have contributed to stereotypes that 
  exist in the field about the HR profession, our failure as HR professionals 
  to recognize that we are business people charged with the company&#8217;s most 
  valuable assets will certainly continue to harbor those stereotypes we so emotionally 
  defend. If you want a seat at the table, learn the business of business and 
  speak the language of the executive team.</p>

<h2>&quot;Talent Management&quot; -
New Movement in Human Resources?</h2>

to refer to the activities of attracting, developing and retaining
employees -- three activities also addressed in the sections below.

<h2>MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND TALENT MANAGEMENT</h2>

<p><a name="anchor722590"></a></p>

<h2>Getting the Best Employees</h2>

<p>Regardless of the nature of the organization, it must identify
the most important roles in the organization and then recruit,
orient, train and organize people to effectively perform those
roles.</p>

suitable policies and procedures for compensating employees and

<p><a name="anchor723072"></a></p>

<h2>Training and Developing Employees</h2>

<p>Development is more than conveying information to employees
-- it's guiding and supporting them to evolve that information
into knowledge that can be applied as skills in order to achieve
the goals of the organization and its people -- and it's guiding
and supporting those people to learn at the same time.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Compliance to Regulations</h2>

<p>Fortunately, compliance is no longer is seen by many as the
primary role of Human Resources -- it's just one of the roles.
However, compliance is as important today as ever, especially
considering the diversity of people in the workplace, including
their diverse values, opinions and perspectives.</p>

<h2>Nonprofit Human Resources</h2>

<p>As noted in the introduction to this topic, guidelines to managed
human resources in nonprofits are very similar to those to manage
in for-profit. See the above paragraph <a href="#anchor240277"
class="textlink">These Human Resource Guidelines Apply to For-Profits
and Nonprofits.</a> After reviewing the above resources, nonprofits
could review the resources from the following link -- the resources
