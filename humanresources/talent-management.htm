<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Talent Management?</h2>
<p>The phrase &quot;talent management&quot; is fairly new and usually refers to 
  the activities to attract, develop and retain employees. Some people and organizations 
  use the phrase to refer especially to talented and/or high-potential employees. 
  The phrase often is used interchangeably with the field of Human Resource Management 
  -- although as the field of talent management continues to mature, it's very 
  likely there will be an increasing number of people who will strongly disagree 
  about the interchange of these fields. At least for now, this Free Management 
  Library considers the topic of Talent Management to be similar to Human Resources 
  Management. Thus, the various aspects and subtopics of Talent Management are 
  those listed in the topic of <a href="http://managementhelp.org/humanresources/index.htm"
class="textlink">Human Resources and Talent Management</a>. The links immediately 
  below provide more overviews of talent management.</p>
<h2><a name="need" id="need"></a>Do We Need Innovation in Talent Management?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>A recent survey conducted by SHRM indicated that human capital is one of the 
  biggest challenges in the next ten years for business. Recruiting and retaining 
  top talent should already be a number one priority of your talent management 
  strategy; however, the challenge will be in adjusting the strategy to accommodate 
  changes in the workforce. The real challenge for the HR professionals and business 
  will be in developing innovative strategy to meet the new normal of the business 
  world. Unfortunately, in HR innovation seems to be a missing skill. And questioning 
  long held beliefs in talent management seems to be an even less common skill 
  or practice found in today&#8217;s HR departments.</p>
<p>As a profession, we tend to get wrapped up in the compliance piece of the job 
  and forget about what it means to recruit and retain talent. In the most recent 
  issue of SHRM magazine, there is a great article on the biggest missteps in 
  performance management. The information is solid and the article is filled with 
  great advice. It lists information that seems to be often forgotten by managers 
  in the workplace le reminding HR folks of all the little things managers do 
  that drive us crazy. By being written from the vain of legal compliance, it 
  reinforces that our job is so filled with compliance that we might not even 
  realize that we have a greater responsibility in our roles as the drivers of 
  talent management. </p>
<p>We owe it to our organizations to focus on innovative and creative strategies 
  that will attract and retain the talent needed to meet the needs of the organization. 
  We have to start by questioning everything we do in our current strategy and 
  see if it actually yields the results that you have been taught that it does. 
  And for all of you in HR who believe our mission is about the people, you should 
  realize that by taking care of the people in your strategy, you will retain 
  them and that is the win-win we always strive for in this profession. </p>
<p>If you want a place to start, look outside of the HR department. Start with 
  the talent.</p>
