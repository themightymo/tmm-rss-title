<h1>Nonprofit-Specific Human Resource Management</h1>

<p>Written by Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Authenticity

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There's a common misperception that human resource management
in nonprofits is very different from human resource management
in for-profits. Actually, the activities are very similar in both
types of organizations, except that nonprofits often include human
resources (staff members) who are volunteers-- staff members who
are not paid compensation. Note that Board members of nonprofits
are volunteers, but usually are not considered to be staff members.
Those who know a great deal about nonprofits also know that the
activities to effectively manage paid staff in nonprofits are
very similar to those required to effectively manage volunteers
in nonprofits, except for the topic of paying volunteers.</p>
