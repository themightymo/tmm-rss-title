<h2>Do I Need Help to Get Started (with taxes, payroll, etc.)?</h2>

<p>(If you're just getting started with your new nonprofit, then
see the section <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-nonprofit.htm"
class="textlink">Starting a Nonprofit</a>.)</p>

<h3>You Can Do Much of the Work Yourself -- But Get Tax Advice
and Guidance</h3>

<p>You should strongly consider getting some help with your taxes.
You can do much of the work yourself, but you should have some
basic guidance and advice from a tax advisor who understands nonprofit
matters. For example, it's very important how you characterize
your plans when filing for incorporation with your state or for
tax-exemption with the IRS. In addition, there are various reports
and filings you likely have to submit. When you're tax-exempt,
you're likely to also be exempt from a variety of other taxes,
including state, property and sales taxes. A nonprofit-knowledgeable
tax advisor can help you a great deal. Ask other nonprofits for
references to good tax advisors. Ask a local funder. Call the
accounting aid association. Note that, in Canada, you can get
tax-exempt status at the provincial or federal level.</p>

<h3>Using a Payroll Service</h3>

<p>As a new nonprofit, you should strongly consider using a payroll
service. This type of service can work with your tax advisor (or
provide tax advice, as well) to ensure regular and accurate withholdings
for various types of taxes. The service can also produce the reports
needed to file your yearly taxes. You might get a recommendation
for a service by calling your local association of certified public
accountants or several nonprofits that are similar in nature to
yours.</p>

<h2>Importance of Good Record Keeping</h2>

<p>Good tax management starts with good record keeping, especially
financial records. You should have a basic sense about<br />

Statements</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor648922"></a></p>

<h2>Getting Tax Exempt Status</h2>

<p>You do not have to get tax-exempt status. However, you should
seriously consider this because it allows you to avoid paying
federal taxes on your income (within certain limits and types
of income). It also helps you to raise money more easily.</p>

<p>NOTE: Obtaining tax-exemption if often one of the steps visited
when formally starting up your nonprofit. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-nonprofit.htm"
class="textlink">Starting a Nonprofit</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Most states also allow tax-exempt nonprofits to also be exempt from some 
  types of income, sales and property taxes. To find out which taxes you might 
  be exempt from, contact your Attorney's General office in your state.</p>

target="_blank" class="textlink">list of types of tax-exempt organizations</a>
to note (most of) the IRS's wide variety of organizations and
classifications of tax-exempt nonprofits.</p>

<p>Nonprofit organizations file for tax-exemption by using IRS
Publication 557, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf"

<h3>Where to Get More Forms</h3>

<p>Any needed federal forms can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/index.html"

&amp; Other Non-Profits</a>.</p>

<h3>Sample 501(c)(3) Application</h3>

<p>There are a variety of tax-exempt classifications. The 501(c)(3)
is one of the most well known, and is for &quot;charitable organization&quot;.
Note that this classification does not necessarily mean that the
nonprofit is also charitable and/or tax-deductible. <br />

<h2>Federal, State, Sales, Payroll Taxes, etc.</h2>

<p>Tax-exempt organizations usually do not have to pay federal
taxes on income. In addition, many states provide exemptions to
income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, etc. It would be extremely
difficult to track and report any standard guidelines about these
various types of taxes across the states. The best way to find
out what taxes you have to pay is to contact your Secretary of
State's office.</p>

<h3>Using a Payroll Service</h3>

<p>(As noted above, if you are a new business, you should strongly
consider using a payroll service.)</p>

<h2>Unrelated Business Income Taxes (UBIT)</h2>

<p>The IRS limits the amount the revenue a nonprofit can make
that is not directly associated with the mission of the nonprofit.
This is in order to prevent nonprofits from unfairly competing
with for-profit organizations. <br />

<h2>Be Careful: When Hiring, Need Independent Contractor or Employee?</h2>

<p>The IRS seems increasingly skeptical about business use of
independent contractors. The IRS is concerned, for example, that
businesses might be avoiding employment taxes by using independent
contractors instead. Therefore, businesses must be careful when
determining if they should hire a contractor or an employee. The
following link will help you in this regard.<br />
