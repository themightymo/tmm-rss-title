<h2>Scope of Information in this Library Topic</h2>

<p>This library could include thousands of links to tax-related
sites. As with other topics in the library, there are enough links
included below to cover the basics and help the reader find more
information if needed. Regarding federal taxes (the type of taxes
most written about), the most comprehensive overviews are included
in IRS Publications 17 and 334 (links to these are included below).
Many federal tax-related links on the Web are to articles that
are basically a rewrite of information that's already in these
two publications. Other types of taxes are reviewed below, too</p>

<h2>Educate Yourself -- Key Publications For You to Get Started</h2>

<p>Whatever the condition of your business finances, always pay
your taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) states that small
businesses pay four kinds of taxes: Income tax, Self-employment
tax, Employment taxes, and Excise taxes. The form of business
determines what kinds of taxes you'll pay. (More on this later.)</p>

<p>If the nature of your business is fairly consistent from year
to year, you may be able to manage your business taxes by yourself.
However, you may be better off the first year to hire a tax advisor.
BUT, you should still be aware of the basic process -- time spent
studying taxes is time spent saving money! There are several basic
publications from the IRS that you should get and review. The
following 2 publications take about 3 hours to go through -- it
will be some of the best time you spend to save money for your
business. The following section &quot;Basics -- Overviews of Small
Business Tax Management&quot; will help you, as well.</p>

<h3>Know the Legal Description of Your Business</h3>

<p>It matters whether you're a sole proprietorship, partnership,
corporation (and which type of corporation), limited liability
corporation, etc. You probably know this already if you have registered
your business with your state. Otherwise, review the materials
in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/enterprise-corporate-laws.htm">Enterprise

<h3>Using a Payroll Service</h3>

<p>As a new business, you should strongly consider using a payroll
service. This type of service can work with your tax advisor (or
provide tax advice, as well) to ensure regular and accurate withholdings
for various types of taxes. The service can also produce the reports
needed to file your yearly taxes. You might get a recommendation
for a service by calling your local association of certified public
accountants or several businesses that are similar in nature to
yours. Your local Chamber of Commerce may know several good sources,
as well.</p>

<h2>Special Topic -- When Hiring, Need Independent Contractor
or Employee?</h2>

<p>The IRS seems increasingly skeptical about business use of
independent contractors. The IRS is concerned, for example, that
businesses might be avoiding employment taxes by using independent
contractors instead. Therefore, businesses must be careful when
determining if they should hire a contractor or an employee. The
following link will help you in this regard.<br />
