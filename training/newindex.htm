<p>Training and development -- or &quot;learning and development&quot; as many 
  refer to it now -- is one of the most important aspects of our lives and our 
  work. (Many people view &quot;training&quot; as an activity that produces the 
  result or outcome of &quot;learning&quot; -- and learning is typically viewed 
  as new knowledge, skills and competencies or abilities.) In our culture, we 
  highly value learning. Yet, despite our having attended many years of schooling, 
  many of us have no idea how to carefully design an approach to training and 
  development. This topic in the Library provides an extensive range of information 
  about training and development, including to depict how the many aspects of 
  training and development relate to each other. Also, this topic explains how 
  training and development can be used, informally or formally, to meet the nature 
  and needs of the reader.</p>
