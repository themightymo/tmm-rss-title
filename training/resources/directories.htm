<h2>What's an Online Directory?</h2>

<p>Online directories are usually very large repositories of information
in regard to one overall topic. Readers can search the directories
for specific subtopics or various ways to get the subtopic (for
example, via online newsletter, Website, etc.). Online directories
are sometimes referred to as learning or knowledge portals (although
these terms are still being defined somewhat.)</p>

<p>The following directories were generously suggested by John
Simkin of <a class="textlink" href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/" target="_blank">Spartacus
Educational</a> on January 20, 2000. Comments from John:<br />
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have had a large number of requests concerning Google and
  good directory websites for education. I would suggest that you
  all [people providing online educational resources!] register
  your website with <a class="textlink" href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
  (at http://www.google.com).</p>
  <p>I have found the following website directories very good.
  Most require you to fill out a form. When they are maintained
  by one individual I have also enclosed their email address. The
  BBC website is the most visited website in Britain (160 million
  page impressions a month). It is not easy to get on there but
  it is well worth the effort.</p>
