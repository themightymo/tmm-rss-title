<h2><a name="prep" id="prep"></a>Preparation for Evaluating Training Activities 
  and Results</h2>
<p>The last phase of the ADDIE model of instructional design, or systematic training, 
  is evaluation. However, the evaluation really should have started even during 
  the previous phase -- the implementation phase -- because the evaluation is 
  of both the activities of the trainer as they are being implemented and of the 
  results of the training as it nears an end or is finished. Evaluation includes 
  getting ongoing feedback, e.g., from the learner, trainer and learner's supervisor, 
  to improve the quality of the training and identify if the learner achieved 
  the goals of the training.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before progressing through the guidelines in this topic, the reader would 
    benefit from first reviewing the information about formal and systematic training, 
    especially the ADDIE model, at <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-isd-and-addie.htm">Formal 
    Training Processes -- Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and ADDIE</a>. </li>
  <li>Then scan the contents of the fourth phase of the ADDIE model systematic 
    planning of training, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/implementing-training.htm">Implementing 
    Your Training Plan</a>. (This evaluation phase is the fifth phase of the ADDIE 
    model.) </li>
  <li>Also, note that there is a document, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm">Complete 
    Guidelines to Design Your Training Plan</a>, that condenses the guidelines 
    from the various topics about training plans to guide you to develop a training 
    plan. That document also provides a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a> that you can use to document the various 
    aspects of your plan</li>

<h2><a name="anchor1347710" id="anchor1347710"></a> Perspective on Evaluating 
  Training</h2>

<p>Evaluation is often looked at from four different levels (the &quot;Kirkpatrick 
  levels&quot;) listed below. Note that the farther down the list, the more valid 
  the evaluation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reaction - What does the learner feel about the training?</li>
  <li>Learning - What facts, knowledge, etc., did the learner gain?</li>
  <li>Behaviors - What skills did the learner develop, that is,
  what new information is the learner using on the job?</li>
  <li>Results or effectiveness - What results occurred, that is,
  did the learner apply the new skills to the necessary tasks in
  the organization and, if so, what results were achieved?</li>
</ol>

<p>Although level 4, evaluating results and effectiveness, is
the most desired result from training, it's usually the most difficult
to accomplish. Evaluating effectiveness often involves the use
of key performance measures -- measures you can see, e.g., faster
and more reliable output from the machine after the operator has
been trained, higher ratings on employees' job satisfaction questionnaires
from the trained supervisor, etc. This is where following sound
principles of performance management is of great benefit.</p>

<h2>Suggestions for Evaluating Training</h2>

<p>Typically, evaluators look for validity, accuracy and reliability
in their evaluations. However, these goals may require more time,
people and money than the organization has. Evaluators are also
looking for evaluation approaches that are practical and relevant.</p>

<p>Training and development activities can be evaluated before,
during and after the activities. Consider the following very basic
suggestions:</p>

<h3>Before the Implementation Phase</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Will the selected training and development methods really
  result in the employee's learning the knowledge and skills needed
  to perform the task or carry out the role? Have other employee's
  used the methods and been successful?</li>
  <li>Consider applying the methods to a highly skilled employee.
  Ask the employee of their impressions of the methods.</li>
  <li>Do the methods conform to the employee's preferences and
  learning styles? Have the employee briefly review the methods,
  e.g., documentation, overheads, etc. Does the employee experience
  any difficulties understanding the methods?</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Implementation of Training</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ask the employee how they're doing. Do they understand what's
  being said?</li>
  <li>Periodically conduct a short test, e.g., have the employee
  explain the main points of what was just described to him, e.g.,
  in the lecture.</li>
  <li>Is the employee enthusiastically taking part in the activities?
  Is he or she coming late and leaving early. It's surprising how
  often learners will leave a course or workshop and immediately
  complain that it was a complete waste of their time. Ask the
  employee to rate the activities from 1 to 5, with 5 being the
  highest rating. If the employee gives a rating of anything less
  than 5, have the employee describe what could be done to get
  a 5.</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Completion of the Training</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Give him or her a test before and after the training and
  development, and compare the results?</li>
  <li>Interview him or her before and after, and compare results?</li>
  <li>Watch him or her perform the task or conduct the role?</li>
  <li>Assign an expert evaluator from inside or outside the organization
  to evaluate the learner's knowledge and skills?</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="roi" id="roi"></a>One Approach to Calculate Return On Investment 
  (ROI)</h2>
<p>(This section was written by <a href="http://ldudleytdhptspecialist.moonfruit.com/" target="_blank">Leigh 
  Dudley</a>. The section mentions HRD -- activities of human resource development 
  -- but the guidelines are as applicable to training and development.)</p>
<p>The calculation of ROI in [training and development] or HRD begins with the 
  basic model, where sequential steps simplify a potentially complicated process. 
  The ROI process model provides a systematic approach to ROI calculations.</p>
<p>The step-by-step approach keeps the process manageable so that users can tackle 
  one issue at a time. The model also emphasizes that this is a logical process 
  that flows from one step to another. ROI calculation to another provides consistency, 
  understanding, and credibility. Each step of the model is briefly described 
  below.</p>
<h3>Collecting Post-Program Data</h3>
<p>Data collection is central to the ROI process and is the starting point of 
  the ROI process . Although the ROI analysis is (or should be) planned early 
  in the training and development cycle, the actual ROI calculation begins with 
  data collection. (Additional information on planning for the ROI analysis is 
  presented later under &#8220;Essential Planning Steps).</p>
<p>The HRD staff should collect both hard data (representing output, quality, 
  cost, and time) and soft data (including work habits, work climate, and attitudes). 
  Collect Level 4 data using a variety of the methods as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Follow-up Questionnaires</strong> &#8211; Administer follow-up 
    questionnaires to uncover specific applications of training. Participants 
    provide responses to a variety of types of open-ended and forced response 
    questions.</li>
  <li>Use questionnaires to capture both Level 3 and Level 4 data. The example 
    below shows a series of level 4 impact questions contained in a follow-up 
    questionnaire for evaluating an automotive manufacturer&#8217;s sales training 
    program in Europe, with appropriate responses. HRD practitioners can use the 
    data in an ROI analysis</li>
  <li><strong>Program Assignments</strong> &#8211; Program assignments are useful 
    for simple, short-term projects. Participants complete the assignment on the 
    job, using the skills or knowledge learned in the program. Report completed 
    assignments as evaluation information, which often contains Level 3/Level 
    4 data. Convert Level 4 data to monetary values and compare the data to cost 
    to develop the ROI</li>
  <li><strong>Action Plans</strong> &#8211; Developed in training and development 
    programs, action plans on the job should be implemented after the program 
    is completed. A follow-up of the plans provides evaluation information. Level 
    3/Level 4 data are collected with action plans, and the HRD staff can develop 
    the ROI from the Level 4 data.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Contracts</strong> &#8211; Developed prior to conducting 
    the program and when the participant, the participant&#8217;s supervisor, 
    and the instructor all agree on planned specific out-comes from the training, 
    performance contracts outline how the program will be implemented. Performance 
    contracts usually collect both Level 3/and Level 4 data and are designed and 
    analyzed in the same way as action plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Monitoring </strong>&#8211; As the most beneficial method 
    to collect Level 4 data, performance monitoring is useful when HRD personnel 
    examine various business performance records and operational data for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important challenge in this step is to select the data collection method 
  or methods that are appropriate for both the setting and the specific program 
  and the time and budget constraints.</p>
<h3>Isolating the Effects of Training</h3>
<p>Isolating the effects of training is an often overlooked issue in evaluations. 
  In this step of the ROI process, explore specific techniques to determine the 
  amount of output performance directly related to the program. This step is essential 
  because many factors influence performance data after training. The specific 
  techniques of this step will pinpoint the amount of improvement directly related 
  to the program, increasing the accuracy and credibility of the ROI calculation. 
  Collectively, the following techniques provide a comprehensive set of tools 
  to tackle the important and critical issue of isolating the effects of training.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Control Group</strong> &#8211; use a control group arrangement 
    to isolate training impact. With this technique, one group receives training 
    while another similar, group does not receive training. The difference in 
    the performance of the two groups is attributed to the training program. When 
    properly set up and implemented, control group arrangement is the most effective 
    way to isolate the effects of training.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact Estimates</strong> &#8211; When the previous approach is 
    not feasible, estimating the impact of training on the output variables is 
    another approach and can be accomplished on the following 4 levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Participants</strong> &#8211; estimate the amount of improvement 
    related to training. In this approach, provide participants with the total 
    amount of improvement, on a pre- and post-program basis, and ask them to indicate 
    the percent of the improvement that is actually related to the training program.</li>
  <li><strong>Supervisors </strong>&#8211; of participants estimate the impact 
    of training on the output variables. Present supervisors with the total amount 
    of improvement, and ask them to indicate the percent related to training.</li>
  <li><strong>Senior Managers</strong> &#8211; estimate the impact of training 
    by providing an estimate or adjustment to reflect the portion of the improvement 
    related to the training program. While perhaps inaccurate, having senior management 
    involved in this process develops ownership of the value and buy-in process.</li>
  <li><strong>Experts</strong> &#8211;estimate the impact of training on the performance 
    variable. Because these estimates are based on previous experience, experts 
    must be familiar with the type of training and the specific situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers sometimes provide input on the extent to which training has influenced 
  their decision to use a product or service. Although this approach has limited 
  applications, it can be quite useful in customer service and sales training.</p>
<h3>Converting Data to Monetary Values</h3>
<p>A number of techniques are available to convert data to monetary values; the 
  selection depends on the type of data and the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Convert output data to profit contribution or cost savings. With this technique, 
    output increases are converted to monetary value based on their unit contribution 
    to profit or the unit of cost reduction. These values are readily available 
    in most organizations and are seen as generally accepted standard values.</li>
  <li>Calculate the cost of quality, and covert quality improvements directly 
    to cost savings. This standard value is available in many organizations for 
    the most common quality measures (such as rejects, rework, and scrap).</li>
  <li>Use the participants&#8217; wages and employee benefits as the value for 
    time in programs where employee time is saved. Because a variety of programs 
    focus on improving the time required to complete projects, processes, or daily 
    activities, the value of time becomes an important and necessary issue. The 
    use of total compensation per hour provides a conservative estimate for the 
    value of time.</li>
  <li>Use historical costs when they are available for a specific variable. In 
    this case, use organizational cost data to establish the specific value of 
    an improvement.</li>
  <li>Use internal and external experts, when available, to estimate a value for 
    an improvement. In this situation, the credibility of the estimate hinges 
    on the expertise and reputation of the individual.</li>
  <li>Use external databases, when available, to estimate the value or cost of 
    data items. Research, government, and industry databases can provide important 
    for these values. The difficulty lies in finding a specific database related 
    to the situation.</li>
  <li>Ask participants to estimate the value of the data item. For this approach 
    to be effective, participants must understand the process and be capable of 
    providing a value for the improvement.</li>
  <li>Require supervisors and managers to provide estimates when they are willing 
    and capable of assigning values to the improvement. This approach is especially 
    useful when participants are not fully capable of providing this input or 
    in situations where supervisors or managers need to confirm or adjust the 
    participant&#8217;s estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting data to monetary value is very important in the ROI model and is 
  absolutely necessary to determine the monetary benefits from a training program. 
  The process is challenging, particularly with the conversion of soft data, but 
  can be methodically accomplished using one or more of the above techniques.</p>
<h3>Tabulating Program Costs</h3>
<p>The other part of the equation in a cost/benefit analysis is the cost of the 
  program. Tabulating the costs involves monitoring or developing all of the related 
  costs of the program targeted for the ROI calculation. Include the following 
  items among the cost components.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Cost to design and develop the program, possibly prorated over the expected 
    life of the program</li>
  <li>Cost of all program materials provided to each participant</li>
  <li>Cost for the instructor/facilitator, including preparation time as well 
    as delivery time.</li>
  <li>Cost of the facilities for the training program.</li>
  <li>Cost of travel, lodging and meals for the participants, if applicable.</li>
  <li>Salaries, plus employee benefits of the training function, allocated in 
    some convenient way.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, specific cost related to the needs assessment and evaluation should 
  be included, if appropriate. The conservative approach is to include all of 
  these costs so that the total is fully loaded.</p>
<h3>Calculating the ROI</h3>
<p>Calculate the ROI using the program benefits and costs. The BCR is the program 
  benefits divided by costs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BCR = program benefits / program costs</li>
  <li>(Sometimes this ratio is stated as a cost/benefit ratio, although the formula 
    is the same as BCR).</li>
</ul>
<p>The net benefits are the program benefits minus the costs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Net benefits = program benefits &#8211; program costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The ROI uses the net benefits divided by programs costs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ROI (%) = net benefits / program costs x 100</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the same basic formula in evaluating other investments where the ROI is 
  traditionally reported as earnings divided by investment. The ROI from some 
  training programs is high. For example, in sales training, supervisory training, 
  and managerial training, the ROI can be quite large, frequently over 100 percent, 
  while ROI value for technical and operator training may be lower.</p>
