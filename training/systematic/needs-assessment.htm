</p><h2>Overall Purpose of Training Needs Assessment and Analysis</h2>

<p>A training analysis is conducted ultimately to identify what areas of knowledge 
  or behaviors that training needs to accomplish with learners. The analysis considers 
  what results the organization needs from the learner, what knowledge and skills 
  the learner presently has and usually concludes with identifying what knowledge 
  and skills the learner must gain (the &quot;performance gap&quot;).</p>

<p>Usually this phase also includes identifying when training should occur and 
  who should attend as learners. Ideally, criteria are established for the final 
  evaluation of training to conclude if training goals were met or not.</p>
<p>Depending on the resources and needs of the organization, a training analysis 
  can range from a very detailed inventory of skills to a general review of performance 
  results. The more complete the training analysis, the more likely that the employee's 
  training will ultimately contribute results to the organization.</p>

<p>Note that employees can require training for a variety of reasons, which usually 
  fall into two categories:<br />
  1. Training to fill a &quot;performance gap&quot; as identified during the performance 
  management process<br />
  2. Training to fill a &quot;growth gap&quot;, that is, to be promoted or be 
  able to fill another open position in the organization</p>
<h2><a name="steps" id="steps"></a>One Approach -- Four Steps to Conducting a 
  Needs Assessment</h2>
<p>(This article was written by <a href="http://ldudleytdhptspecialist.moonfruit.com/" target="_blank">Leigh 
  Dudley</a>; copyright, Leigh Dudley.)</p>
<h3>Step 1 -- Perform a &quot;Gap&quot; Analysis </h3>
<p>The first step is to check the actual performance of our organizations and 
  our people against existing standards, or to set new standards. There are two 
  parts to this:</p>
<h4> Current Situation</h4>
<p>We must determine the current state of skills, knowledge, and abilities of 
  our current and/or future employees. This analysis also should examine our organizational 
  goals, climate, and internal and external constraints.</p>
<h4>Desired or Necessary Situation</h4>
<p>We must identify the desired or necessary conditions for organizational and 
  personal success. This analysis focuses on the necessary job tasks/standards, 
  as well as the skills, knowledge and abilities needed to accomplish these successfully. 
  It is important that we identify the critical tasks necessary, and not just 
  observe our current practices. We also must distinguish our actual needs from 
  our perceived needs -- our wants. The &#8220;gap&#8221; between the current 
  and the necessary will identify our needs, purposes and objectives.</p>
<p>What are we looking for? Here are some questions to ask to determine where 
  training and development or even human resource development (HRD) may be useful 
  in providing solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong><em>Problems or deficits. </em></strong>Are there problems in the 
    organization which might be solved by training or other HRD activities?</li>
  <li><strong><em>Impending change. </em></strong>Are there problems which do 
    not currently exist but are likely due to changes, such as new processes and 
    equipment, outside competition and/or changes in staffing?</li>
  <li><strong><em>Opportunities: </em></strong>Could we gain a competitive edge 
    by taking advantage of new technologies, training programs consultants or 
    suppliers?</li>
  <li><strong><em>Strengths: </em></strong>How can we take advantage of our organizational 
    strengths, as opposed to reacting to our weaknesses? Are there opportunities 
    to apply HRD to these areas?</li>
  <li><strong><em>New directions: </em></strong>Could we take a proactive approach, 
    applying HRD to move our organizations to new levels of performance? For example, 
    could team building and related activities help improve our productivity?</li>
  <li><em><strong>Mandated training: </strong></em>Are there internal or external 
    forces dictating that training and/or organization development will take place? 
    Are there policies or management decisions which might dictate the implementation 
    of some program? Are there governmental mandates to which we must comply?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 -- Identify Priorities and Importance </h3>
<p>The first step should have produced a list of needs for training and development, 
  career development, organization development and/or other interventions. Now 
  we must examine these in view of their importance to our organizational goals, 
  realities and constraints. We must determine if the identified needs are real, 
  if they are worth addressing, and specify their importance and urgency in view 
  of our organizational needs and requirements. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><strong> Cost-effectiveness: </strong></em>How does the cost of the 
    problem compare to the cost of implementing a solution? In other words, we 
    perform a cost-benefit analysis.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Legal mandates: </em></strong>Are there laws requiring a solution? 
    (For example; safety or regulatory compliance.)</li>
  <li><em><strong>Executive pressure: </strong></em>Does top management expect 
    a solution?</li>
  <li><em><strong>Population: </strong></em>Are many people or key people involved?</li>
  <li><em><strong>Customers: </strong></em>What influence is generated by customer 
    specifications and expectations?</li>
</ul>
<p>If some of our needs are of relatively low importance, then we would do better 
  to devote our energies to addressing other human performance problems with greater 
  impact and greater value.</p>
<h3>Step 3 -- Identify Causes of Performance Problems and/or Opportunities</h3>
<p>Now that we have prioritized and focused on critical organizational and personal 
  needs, we will next identify specific problem areas and opportunities in our 
  organization. We must know what our performance requirements are, if appropriate 
  solutions are to be applied. We should ask two questions for every identified 
  need:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Are our people doing their jobs effectively?</li>
  <li>Do they know how to do their jobs?</li>
</ol>
<p>This will require detailed investigation and analysis of our people, their 
  jobs and our organizations &#8212; both for the current situation and in preparation 
  for the future.</p>
<h3>Step 4 - Identify Possible Solutions and Growth Opportunities</h3>
<p>If people are doing their jobs effectively, then perhaps we should leave well 
  enough alone. (&#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221;) However, 
  some training and/or other interventions might be called for if it's important 
  enough to move our people and their performance in new directions.</p>
<p>But if our people ARE NOT doing their jobs effectively, then training may be 
  the solution if there is indeed a knowledge problem.</p>
<p> Organization development activities may provide solutions when the problem 
  is not based on a lack of knowledge and is primarily associated with systematic 
  change. These interventions might include strategic planning, organization restructuring, 
  performance management and/or effective team building.</p>
<p>(Consider writing your training goals in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.)</p>
<h2><a name="another" id="another"></a>Another Approach to Needs Assessment to 
  Determine Your Overall Goals in Training</h2>
<p>The purpose of the needs assessment is to help you determine what you need 
  to learn to, for example, qualify for a certain job, overcome a performance 
  problem or achieve a goal in your career development plan. Learners are often 
  better off to work towards at most two to four goals at a time.</p>

  <li><b>Optional: You may want to re-review some of the following information:</b> 
    <br />
    <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/guidelines-to-enrich-trainings.htm#anchor1689522">Goals 
    -- Selecting the Training and Development Goals</a></li>
  <li><b>Are there any time lines that you should consider in your plan?</b><br />
    Do you have to accomplish any certain areas of knowledge or skills by a certain 
    time? If so, this may influence your choice of learning objectives and learning 
    activities to achieve the objectives. (Record your time lines in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a>.)</li>
  <li><b>Are you pursuing training and development in order to address a performance 
    gap?</b><br />
    A performance gap is usually indicated from the performance appraisal process. 
    The performance appraisal document should already include careful description 
    of the areas of knowledge and skills that you must learn in order to improve 
    your performance. To understand performance gaps, see<br />
    <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/index.htm">Employee Performance 
    Management</a></li>
  <li><b>Or, is your plan to address a growth gap?</b><br />
    If so, carefully identify what areas of knowledge and skills are needed to 
    reach your goals in your career. Consider referencing job descriptions, lists 
    of competencies or even networking with others already in the positions that 
    you want to reach in the near future. The following links might help you.

    | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/finding-jobs.htm">Job Searching</a></li>
  <li><b>Or, is your plan to address an opportunity gap?</b><br />
    If so, carefully identify what areas of knowledge and skills are needed to 
    perform the job or role that soon might be available to you. Again, consider 
    job descriptions, lists of competencies or even interviewing someone already 
    in the job or role that may soon be available to you.<br />
    The following links might help you. <br />

  <li><b>Get feedback from others</b><br />
    Ask for advice from friends, peers, your supervisors and others. They can 
    be a real treasure for real-world feedback about you! For example, you (and 
    your supervisor, is applicable) could work together to conduct a SWOT (an 
    acronym) analysis, including identifying the your <b>s</b>trengths, <b>w</b>eaknesses, 
    <b>o</b>pportunities and any <b>t</b>hreats to reaching the your desired goals.</li>
  <li><b>Should you conduct a self-assessment?</b><br />
    For example, you (and your supervisor, is applicable) could work together 
    to conduct a SWOT (an acronym) analysis, including identifying the your <b>s</b>trengths, 
    <b>w</b>eaknesses, <b>o</b>pportunities and any <b>t</b>hreats to reaching 
    the your desired goals. There are also a wide variety of self-assessments 
    available at <br />
    <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/self-assessments.htm">Self-Assessments (numerous 
    self-assessments)</a></li>
  <li><b>Is a list of competencies, job descriptions or job analysis available 
    to help you identify your training and development goals?</b><br />
    A competencies list is a list of the abilities needed to carry out a certain 
    role. The list can be very useful to you when identifying your learning objectives 
    in your training and development plan. See information in the sections<br />
    <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job 
    Analysis</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job 
    Description</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Competencies</a></li>
  <li><b>Begin thinking about how much money you will need to fund your plan.</b><br />
    You might need money, e.g., to pay trainers, obtain facilities and materials 
    for training methods, pay wages or salaries for employees during attendance 
    to training events, etc. Begin recording your expected expenses in the &quot;Budget&quot; 
    section of the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Identify your training goals.</b><br />
    By now, you should have a strong sense of what your training goals are, after 
    having considered each of the above steps. It's important that goals be designed 
    and worded to be &quot;SMARTER&quot; (an acronym), that is, <b>s</b>pecific, 
    <b>m</b>easurable, <b>a</b>cceptable to you, <b>r</b>ealistic to achieve, 
    <b>t</b>ime-bound with a deadline, <b>e</b>xtending your capabilities and 
    <b>r</b>ewarding to you. (For more guidance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm#anchor1384873">Goals 
    and Objectives Should Be SMARTER</a>.) Write down your training goals in the

    Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
