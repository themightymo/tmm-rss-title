<h2><a name="prep" id="prep"></a>Preparation for Developing Your Training Activities 
  and Materials</h2>
<p>The design phase and the development phase of systematic training planning 
  often overlap. During the design phase or development phase, the various training 
  activities must be selected, for example, to be instructor-led, computer-based, 
  Web-based, self-directed, interactive or multi-media. The development phase 
  of systematic training often includes selecting the most appropriate media and 
  materials, for example, developing audio-visuals, graphics, manuals, preparing 
  any needed facilities, and piloting course content to ensure it is understandable. 
  Often the design and development phases are highly integrated. The design of 
  the training is often piloted, or initially tested, during the development phase 
  to ensure the content is understandable and applicable to the learners. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Before progressing through the guidelines in this topic, the reader would 
    benefit from first reviewing the information about formal and systematic training, 
    especially the ADDIE model, at <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-isd-and-addie.htm">Formal 
    Training Processes -- Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and ADDIE</a>. </li>
  <li>Then scan the contents of the second phase of the ADDIE model of systematic 
    planning of training, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm">Designing 
    Training Plans and Learning Objectives</a>. (This development phase is the 
    third phase of the ADDIE model.)</li>
  <li>Also, note that there is a document, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm">Complete 
    Guidelines to Design Your Training Plan</a>, that condenses the guidelines 
    from the various topics about training plans to guide you to develop a training 
    plan. That document also provides a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a> that you can use to document the various 
    aspects of your plan.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="guidelines" id="guidelines"></a>Key Considerations to Develop Your 
  Activities and Materials</h2>
<h3> What is the Immediacy to Achieve the New Learning?</h3>
<p>The more immediate the need to achieve the learning, the more important that 
  the activities and materials be understandable and readily accessible to the 
  learners. In these situations, it often is warranted to use an expert who can 
  promptly design, develop and deliver the training plan, activities and materials. 
  Also, it's very useful if the activities and materials can be based on activities 
  already underway in the workplace so that learners do not have to take time 
  away from work, but rather can promptly affect their work even as they participate 
  in the learning program. </p>
<h3>What Are the Learners' Preferences and Learning Styles?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes in designing training plans is to choose activities 
  and materials that do not match the preferences and styles of the learners. 
  Probably the most common example is putting adults through extended hours of 
  lecture. Those activities usually lull adults into a stupor, rather than sustaining 
  sufficient interest and engagement to accomplish sustained learning among the 
  adults. One of the best ways to discern the most appropriate styles of activities 
  is to have learners undertake a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/learning-styles.htm">learning 
  styles inventory</a> or at least to consider the various styles that seem common 
  to the types of learners who will be in the training program. </p>
<h3>How Much Time Can Learners Realistically Apply to the Learning Activities?</h3>
<p>This has become one of the most important considerations when designing and 
  developing training plans. Workplaces seem increasingly busy as people try to 
  do more with less. It's often very difficult for them to take time away from 
  the office. The more the training activities can accommodate the busy schedules 
  of learners, the better -- and the more likely that learners will actually attend 
  the training sessions. It's often better to design frequent and short trainings 
  sessions than fewer, extended sessions. </p>
<h3>Can the Learners Readily Access the Activities and Materials? Do They Build 
  On Current Work Activities?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of compute- and Web-based activities is that 
  learners can access them from anywhere, which greatly decreases the cost of 
  training and development activities. Thus, the rapid expansion of technology-based 
  activities in trainings. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Online 
  Learning</a>.) One of the best ways to ensure that training activities are highly 
  accessible is to build them into the activities already underway in the workplace.</p>
<h3>How Much Money is Available to Obtain and Develop the Resources?</h3>
<p>It's common that curriculum designers develop wonderful training programs that 
  seem guaranteed to achieve the goals of the program, but after further review, 
  are clearly so expensive that the program is prohibitive or not realistic. Therefore, 
  it's important, even before the initial needs assessments are done, to get some 
  sense of the availability of funding to obtain and develop resources. Technology-based 
  and on-the-job-based activities often are much less expensive than hiring subject 
  matter experts. However, those experts are especially useful if the training 
  is to convey highly specialized or technical content. </p>
<h3>Will the Activities Achieve the Learning Objectives?</h3>
<p>Now we get to the most important consideration. Even if the activities are 
  well-suited to the learners, readily accessible and well-funded, will they together 
  really achieve the overall goals of the training program? Here again is where 
  it's useful to consult an expert or to reference best practices or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">competencies</a> 
  in the particular areas being trained. </p>
<h3>How Will the Activities and Materials Be Field-Tested?</h3>
<p>It's very important to explain the activities to a few of the learners and 
  to have them examine the materials. They are best suited to judge if the activities 
  and materials are truly understandable and suited to the needs and styles of 
  the learners. Listen to their advice, and modify the activities and materials 
  accordingly. </p>
<h2><a name="select" id="select"></a>Critical Consideration -- Selecting a Trainer</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important ingredient of any training program is the trainer 
  (unless the program is entirely self-directed). Today's learners are very sensitive 
  to how well a trainer engages them by being enthusiastic about the material, 
  cultivating interaction among the learners, and really listening to -- and respecting 
  -- them. </p>
<h3>Is the Potential Trainer Well-Suited to the Nature of the Learners?</h3>
<p>The most important consideration when selecting a trainer is if they are well 
  suited to the training design required to meet the learning goals. For example, 
  if learners prefer computer-based instruction, they'll benefit from a trainer 
  who understands online training technologies. If learners prefers ongoing coaching, 
  they'll benefit from a trainer who is readily accessible to the employee for 
  ongoing advice and guidance. If learners struggle with communication skills, 
  they'll benefit from a trainer who can integrate remedial communications strategies 
  with other training methods.</p>
<h3>Collaborate With Other Departments or Groups Doing Similar Training?</h3>
<p>Consider whether other supervisors or companies have employees who need similar 
  training. If so, one might combine your needs and funding to get a trainer to 
  conduct in-house training.</p>
<h3>Use Former Employees as Trainers?</h3>
<p>Consider using an ex-employee who has the skills needed by the learner. Of 
  course, this option depends on whether the ex-employee left the organization 
  under good terms and remains in good standing with the organization.</p>
<h3>Use Subject-Matter Experts as Trainers</h3>
<p>There's a wise saying that &quot;Telling ain't training.&quot; Just because 
  someone has strong knowledge of the subject matter does not mean that he or 
  she will be a good trainer. If you are considering hiring a consultant to conduct 
  the training then consider issuing a Request for Proposal which asks potential 
  trainers for the following information.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A written proposal for how they would carry out training, evaluation methods, 
    cost, etc.</li>
  <li>The goals preferred from the training, when to have training and what evaluation 
    results should occur</li>
  <li>Request that trainers remain available for follow-up consultation if desired</li>
  <li>Ask the trainer what methods they use to ensure their consultation projects 
    are successful with clients</li>
  <li>Ask for at least three references</li>
  <li>Consider having the employee briefly meet with the consultant to discuss 
    training needs and establish a rapport</li>
</ul>
<p>See the extensive advice and the sample forms for <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm">a 
  request for proposals, a proposal from consultants and a consultation plan</a>.</p>
<h3>Resort to Self-directed Learning?</h3>
<p>If a suitable outside consultant or training program cannot be found, consider 
  self-directed learning. Self-directed is accomplished primarily by the learner 
  who leads or takes a strong role in determining learning goals, how they will 
  be accomplished and how learning will be verified. Self-directed learning can 
  be used where employees are highly motivated and self-reliant. Learning can 
  be verified with a variety of means, e.g.,</p>
<ol>
  <li>Written reports describing what learning activities have occurred and what 
    results were produced</li>
  <li>Observation of the employee by a supervisor or other skilled expert equipped 
    to assess progress of the employee</li>
  <li>A portfolio or collection of results showing the employees' improvement 
    over time</li>
  <li>A presentation from the employee that includes description of learning activities 
    and a display of results, etc</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="types" id="types"></a>Many Possible Types of Training Activities</h2>
<p>There seems an increasing amount of different activities that can be considered 
  when customizing activities to the goals of a training program and to the nature 
  and needs of the learners. Consider <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Various 
  Ideas for Learning Activities</a>.</p>
