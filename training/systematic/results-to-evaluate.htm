<h1>Samples of Learner's Results As Means to Verify Learning</h1>

<!--[index|Training and Development]-->

<p>(This page is referenced from <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm#anchor215557">Basic
Framework for Training and Development Plan</a>.)</p>

<p>There are numerous means by which a learner can show evidence
of learning -- many means other than the traditional passing of
tests in a course. The following list provides examples of results,
or outputs, that can be produced by a learner during learning
activities as means of verification of learning. These results
can be examined by a subject matter expert to evaluate the extent
of learning (new areas of knowledge and skills) accomplished by
the learner. The list may prove useful particularly when designing
self-directed training and development plans. Keep in mind that
the following list is but a small sample of means of verification
of learning. (The list is reproduced from a list provided by The
Union Institute.)</p>
