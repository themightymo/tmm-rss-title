<p>Self-directed learners can use these guidelines to develop
their own training plan. Whether their training goals involve
learning certain topics and/or skills, learners can start their
learning by starting their planning.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not be intimidated by the length of this framework.
If you looked at a list of all of the steps necessary to go grocery
shopping, you'd likely stay at home! You can complete these guidelines
without being an expert. All you need is to make a commitment
and take a few hours of your time -- time during which you'll
be learning, too!</p>

<h2>Directions to Use &quot;Complete Guidelines ...&quot;</h2>

<p>If you are designing a training plan to enhance introductory
understanding and/or skills in management, leadership or supervision,
then follow the directions in the appropriate topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/development/index.htm">Management
Development</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/development/index.htm">Leadership
Development</a> or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/development/index.htm">Supervisoral
Development</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: In this document, the term &quot;supervisor&quot; is
used to refer to the position to whom the learner directly reports,
for example, a chief executive reports to a board of directors.</p>

<p>Design your training plan by proceeding through each of the
following numbered steps in this document. You will be guided
to write your training plan using <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>

<a name="anchor1047187"></a>

<h2>Preparation for Designing Your Training Plan</h2>

<h3>Don't Worry About Whether Your Plan is Perfect or Not -- The
Plan is Guide, Not Law</h3>

<p>Don't worry about whether you completely understand key terms
in training or whether your plan is &quot;perfect&quot; or not.
The key is to get started. Start simple, but start. Do the best
that you can for now. There is no perfect plan. You're doing the
plan according to your own nature and needs.</p>

<p>Also, it's not important to stick to the plan for the sake
of the plan. The plan will likely change as you go along. That's
fine, as long as you've notice that it's been changed and why.</p>

<h3>Remember that Training and Development is a Process</h3>

<p>So often when we design a plan, the plan becomes the end rather
than the means. The plan is a general guide -- the real treasure
found from implementing your plan is the learning you achieve.
Learning is an ongoing process. Look at learning as a process
and you enjoy the long time during the journey rather than the
short time at the destination.</p>

<h3>Get Some Sense of These Basic Terms</h3>

<p>You don't have to be expert at the following terms -- just
get a general sense about them.</p>

<p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">

    3. delegate to a certain employee for one month<br />
    4. etc.</td> 
    <td valign="top">

    making approaches<br />

<h2>Determining Your Overall Goals in Training</h2>

<p>This section helps you identify what you want to be able to
do as a result of implementing your training plan, for example,
qualify for a certain job, overcome a performance problem, meet
a goal in your career development plan, etc. Learners are often
better off to work towards at most two to four goals at a time.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Optional: You may want to re-review some of the following
  information:</b>
 <br /> <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/guidelines-to-enrich-trainings.htm#anchor1689522">Goals
  -- Selecting the Training and Development Goals</a></li>
  <li><b>Are there any time lines that you should consider in your
  plan?</b><br />
  Do you have to accomplish any certain areas of knowledge or skills
  by a certain time? If so, this may influence your choice of learning
  objectives and learning activities to achieve the objectives.
  (Record your time lines in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.)</li>
  <li><b>Are you pursuing training and development in order to
  address a performance gap?</b><br />
  A performance gap is usually indicated from the performance appraisal
  process. The performance appraisal document should already include
  careful description of the areas of knowledge and skills that
  you must learn in order to improve your performance. To understand
  performance gaps, see<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/index.htm">Employee
  Performance Management</a></li>
  <li><b>Or, is your plan to address a growth gap?</b><br />
  If so, carefully identify what areas of knowledge and skills
  are needed to reach your goals in your career. Consider referencing
  job descriptions, lists of competencies or even networking with
  others already in the positions that you want to reach in the
  near future. The following links might help you. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job
  Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Competencies</a>
  | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/networking.htm">Networking</a>
  | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/planning.htm">Career
  Planning</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/finding-jobs.htm">Job
  Searching</a></li>
  <li><b>Or, is your plan to address an opportunity gap?</b><br />
  If so, carefully identify what areas of knowledge and skills
  are needed to perform the job or role that soon might be available
  to you. Again, consider job descriptions, lists of competencies
  or even interviewing someone already in the job or role that
  may soon be available to you.<br />
  The following links might help you. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job
  Descriptions</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Competencies</a>
  | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/networking.htm">Networking</a>
  | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/planning.htm">Career
  Planning</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/careers/finding-jobs.htm">Job
  Searching</a></li>
  <li><b>Get feedback from others</b><br />
  Ask for advice from friends, peers, your supervisors and others.
  They can be a real treasure for real-world feedback about you!
  For example, you (and your supervisor, is applicable) could work
  together to conduct a SWOT (an acronym) analysis, including identifying
  the your <b>s</b>trengths, <b>w</b>eaknesses, <b>o</b>pportunities
  and any <b>t</b>hreats to reaching the your desired goals.</li>
  <li><b>Should you conduct a self-assessment?</b><br />
  For example, you (and your supervisor, is applicable) could work
  together to conduct a SWOT (an acronym) analysis, including identifying
  the your <b>s</b>trengths, <b>w</b>eaknesses, <b>o</b>pportunities
  and any <b>t</b>hreats to reaching the your desired goals. There
  are also a wide variety of self-assessments available at <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/self-assessments.htm">Self-Assessments
  (numerous self-assessments)</a></li>
  <li><b>Is a list of competencies, job descriptions or job analysis
  available to help you identify your training and development
  goals?</b><br />
  A competencies list is a list of the abilities needed to carry
  out a certain role. The list can be very useful to you when identifying
  your learning objectives in your training and development plan.
  See information in the sections<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job
  Analysis</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Job
  Description</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">Competencies</a></li>
  <li><b>Begin thinking about how much money you will need to fund
  your plan.</b><br />
  You might need money, e.g., to pay trainers, obtain facilities
  and materials for training methods, pay wages or salaries for
  employees during attendance to training events, etc. Begin recording
  your expected expenses in the &quot;Budget&quot; section of the
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Identify your training goals.</b><br />
  By now, you should have a strong sense of what your training
  goals are, after having considered each of the above steps. It's
  important that goals be designed and worded to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;
  (an acronym), that is, <b>s</b>pecific, <b>m</b>easurable, <b>a</b>cceptable
  to you, <b>r</b>ealistic to achieve, <b>t</b>ime-bound with a
  deadline, <b>e</b>xtending your capabilities and <b>r</b>ewarding
  to you. (For more guidance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm#anchor1384873">Goals
  and Objectives Should Be SMARTER</a>.) Write down your training
  goals in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>

<h2>Determining Your Learning Objectives and Activities</h2>

<p>The purpose of this part of your planning is to design learning
objectives that ultimately accomplish your reaching your overall
training and development goals. You will also identify the learning
activities (or methods) you'll need to conduct to achieve your
learning objectives and overall training goals.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>You may want to re-review information in the sections:</b>
 <br /> <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm">Designing

  -- Building More Learning into the Training and Development Plan</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Various
  Ideas for Ways to Learn</a></li>
  <li><b>Identify some preliminary learning objectives for each
  new area of knowledge or skills that you need to learn.</b><br />
  Carefully consider each of your training goals. What specifically
  must be accomplished (that is, what objectives must be reached)
  in order for you to reach those goals? Which of these objectives
  require learning new areas of knowledge or skills? These objectives
  are likely to become learning objectives in your training plan.
  Similar to the nature of training goals, learning objectives
  should be designed and worded to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;. (See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm">Basic
  Guidelines and Examples for Writing Learning Objectives</a>.)</li>
  <li><b>In what sequence should the learning objectives be attained?</b>
 <br />
  Usually, learning builds on learning. It may be useful to learn
  certain areas of knowledge and skills before learning new areas.</li>
  <li><b>Carefully consider -- When you have achieved all of your
  learning objectives, will you indeed have achieved all of your
  overall training goals?</b><br />
  Now you're read to write down your learning objectives in the
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>What are the best learning activities (methods) for you
  to achieve your learning objectives?</b><br />
  Do the methods match your particular learning style, e.g., reading,
  doing or listening? Do the methods stretch your styles, too?
  Are the methods readily accessible to you? Do the methods take
  advantage of real-life learning opportunities, e.g., use on-the-job
  training opportunities, real-life problems that occur at work,
  use of projects and programs at work? Note that learning activities
  do always match learning objectives on a one-for-one basis. You
  might benefit from the following links, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm#anchor931247">Some
  Typical Ways of Learning</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm#anchor789424">Some
  New Ways of Learning in the Workplace</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/learning-styles.htm">Learning
  Style Inventory</a>.)</li>
  <li><b>Do your learning activities include your ongoing reflections
  about your learning?</b><br />
  You (and your supervisor, if applicable) will benefit from regularly
  taking time to stand back and inquire about what is going on
  in your training, what are you learning and how, if anything
  should be changed, etc. Skills in reflection are critical for
  ongoing learning in your life and work. Consider using a <a 
  href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/journaling.htm">private
  learning journal</a>. Now you're read to write down your learning
  activities in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>What observable results, or evidence of learning, will
  you produce from your learning activities that can be reviewed
  for verification of learning?</b><br />
  For ideas about what results to design into your plan, see <a
  href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/results-to-evaluate.htm">Samples
  of Learner's Results as Means to Verify Learning.</a> Now you're
  ready to write down your evidence of learning in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Who will verify that each of your learning objectives
  were reached?</b><br />
  Ideally, your learning is evaluated by someone who has strong
  expertise in the areas of knowledge and skills required to achieve
  your training goals. Now you're ready to write down your evaluator
  in the <a REF="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Now that you know what activities that will be conducted,
  think again about any costs that will be needed, e.g., for materials,
  facilities, etc.</b><br />
  You may want to update the &quot;Budget&quot; section in the
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>How will you handle any ongoing time and stress management
  issues while implementing your plan?</b><br />
  Professional development inherently includes the need for self-development,
  as well. Therefore, you might consider information in the sections<br />

</ol>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor333946"></a>

<h2>Developing Any Materials You May Need</h2>

<p>The goal of this phase of your planning is to obtain or develop
any resources you need to conduct the activities you selected
in the previous phase of the plan.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>You may want to review information in the section</b> 
 <br /> <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/developing-training-materials.htm">Developing
  Training Materials (developing facilities, documents, graphics,
  etc.)</a></li>
  <li><b>Consider if you need to obtain, or start:</b><br />
  Enrolling in courses, buying books, scheduling time with experts,
  getting a mentor, scheduling time with your supervisor, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Now that you've thought more closely about learning methods
  and associated materials, think again about any costs that will
  be needed, e.g., for materials, facilities, etc.</b><br />
  You may want to update the &quot;Budget&quot; section in the
<a REF="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Should any of your planned learning methods be pretested?</b>
 <br />
  Should you have anyone else use the methods and share their impressions
  about the methods with you? Have you briefly reviewed the methods,
  e.g., documentation, overheads, etc? Did you experience any difficulties
  understanding the methods?</li>
</ol>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor334572"></a>

<h2>Planning Implementation of Your Training Plan</h2>

<p>The goal of this phase of your planning is to ensure there
are no surprises during the implementation phase of your training.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>You may want to review information in the following section</b>
 <br /> <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/implementing-training.htm">Implementation
  - Conducting or Experiencing the Training</a></li>
  <li><b>During your training, how will you be sure that you understand
  the new information and materials?</b><br />
  Periodically conduct a short test, e.g., everyone once in a while,
  try recall the main points of what you have just learned, test
  yourself, etc. If you are confused, tell your trainer now.</li>
  <li><b>Will your learning be engaging and enjoyable?</b>
  <li><b>Are you sure that you'll receive the necessary ongoing
  feedback, coaching, mentoring, etc., during your training and
  development activities?</b><br />
  Consider information in the sections<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/feedback.htm">Sharing
  Feedback</a> | <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm">Coaching</a>

  <li><b>Where will you get necessary administrative support and
  materials?</b>&gt;
  <li><b>During implementation, if any changes should be made to
  your plan, how will they be tracked? How will the plan be redesigned?
  How will it be communicated and to the right people?</b>
</ol>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor336233"></a>

<h2>Planning Quality Control and Evaluation of Your Training Plan
and Experiences</h2>

<p>The goal of this phase of your planning is to ensure your plan
will indeed meet your training goals in a realistic and efficient
fashion.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>You may want to review information in the section:</b>
 <br /> <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/ROI-evaluating-training.htm">Evaluating
  Training Process and Results</a></li>
  <li><b>Who's in charge of implementing and tracking your overall
  plan?</b><br />
  How will you know if the plan is on track or needs to be changed?</li>
  <li><b>Consider having a local training expert review the plan.</b>
 <br />
  The expert can review, in particular, whether <br />
  - your training goals will provide the results desired by you
  (and your organization, if applicable), <br />
  - learning objectives are specific and aligned with your overall
  training goals, <br />
  - the best methods are selected for reaching your learning objectives,
  and <br />
  - your approach to evaluation is valid and practical. <br />
  You may want to update the &quot;Budget&quot; section in the
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Are approaches to evaluation included in all phases of
  your plan?</b><br />
  For example, are your methods being pretested before being applied?
  Do you understand the methods as they're being applied? Are regularly
  providing feedback about how well you understand the materials?
  How will the you (and your supervisor, if applicable) know if
  implementation of the plan achieves the training goals identified
  in the plan? Are there any plans for follow-up evaluation, including
  assessing your results several months after you completed your
  plan?</li>
</ol>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor336483"></a>

<h2>Follow-Up After Completion of Your Plan</h2>

<p>This is often the part of the plan that gets neglected. In
our society, we're often so focused on identifying the next problem
to solve, that few of us have the ability to acknowledge successful
accomplishments and then celebrate. The design and of this plan
has probably been a very enlightening experience for you -- an
experience that brought a perspective on learning you can apply
in a great many other arenas of your life. Congratulations!</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Are follow-up evaluation methods being carried out?</b>
  <li><b>Did you (and your supervisor, if applicable) complete
  a successful experience to develop and implement a training and
  development plan? Is this accomplishment being fully recognized?</b>
 <br />
  Consider information in the section <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/rewarding.htm">Reward
