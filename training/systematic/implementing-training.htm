<h2><a name="prep" id="prep"></a>Preparation for Implementing Your Training Plan</h2>
<p>The purpose of the implementation phase is to implement the training plan that 
  you designed and developed in earlier phases of the systematic approach to training. 
  This is when the learners undertake the activities of learning, produce the 
  various tangible results that can be referenced as means to evaluate learners' 
  progress toward achieving the learning objectives, and evaluation occurs not 
  only of the results produced by learners but also the activities of implementation 
  to ensure those activities themselves are high-quality. If the previous phases 
  of assessment, design and development we done well, then this implementation 
  phase should go quite smoothly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before progressing through the guidelines in this topic, the reader would 
    benefit from first reviewing the information about formal and systematic training, 
    especially the ADDIE model, at <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-isd-and-addie.htm">Formal 
    Training Processes -- Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and ADDIE</a>. </li>
  <li>Then scan the contents of the third phase of the ADDIE model systematic 
    planning of training, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/developing-training-materials.htm">Developing 
    Training Activities and Materials</a>. (This implementation phase is the fourth 
    phase of the ADDIE model.)</li>
  <li>Also, note that there is a document, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm">Complete 
    Guidelines to Design Your Training Plan</a>, that condenses the guidelines 
    from the various topics about training plans to guide you to develop a training 
    plan. That document also provides a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a> that you can use to document the various 
    aspects of your plan</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="key" id="key"></a>Key Considerations During Implementation</h2>
<h3>Are Learners Participating in the Activities?</h3>
<p>Closely monitor the attendance and participation of the learners. It's tempting 
  to forgive low attendance and participation between learners are extremely busy. 
  If you are confronted with that situation, then reflect on how important the 
  training really is. Regardless, as soon as you notice low attendance or participation, 
  you should mention it to the learners. That short communication alone is often 
  sufficient to reinforce the importance of their engagement in the training. 
  Also, you might learn what you didn't know that you didn't know, for example, 
  that the activities and materials are not nearly as suitable to the learners 
  as you might have thought. </p>
<h3>Are You Evaluating the Quality of the Activities and Achievement of Objectives?</h3>
<p>When you designed the learning objectives, you also identified certain tangible 
  results that learners would produce, so those results could be evaluated. Are 
  you referencing those results? What is their quality? Are you seeing any progress 
  toward achieving the overall training goals that were identified during the 
  first phase -- the needs assessment phase -- of the planning of systematic training? 
  What comments and other feedback are you getting from the learners that will 
  be useful in ensuring a high-quality training program? (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/ROI-evaluating-training.htm">Evaluating 
  Training and Results -- ROI of Training</a>.)</p>
<h3>What Changes Might Be Needed to the Learning Activities and Materials?</h3>
<p>Training plans are changed much more frequently than most people realize. Plans 
  can be changed, as long as they're changed in a systematic approach, for example, 
  if the version of the plan is updated, the impact of the change is considered 
  for each phase of the planning, and the changed plan is distributed to all relevant 
  participants. </p>
<h2><a name="wise" id="wise"></a>Wise Advice for Any Trainer</h2>
<p>(This Library has a link to a vast amount of tips and tools for teachers and 
  trainers. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/roles/trainers.htm">Tips 
  and Tools for Trainers and Teachers</a>. However, this author believes the following 
  advice is fundamental to any of the tips in the articles referenced from that 
  link. The advice is excerpted from <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/training-and-development/2011/03/30/how-to-make-training-an-affair-to-remember/" target="_blank">Jack 
  Shaw's blog post &quot;Make Teaching An Affair to Remember&quot;</a>.)</p>
<p>My biggest concern for trainers is that, for the most part, they are more focused 
  on the process of training according to the trainer&#8217;s guide, than on communicating 
  with the trainees or audience. It&#8217;s a little like &#8220;which came first?&#8221; 
  The basics of public speaking apply, taking into account the audience, the subject 
  and the trainer/presenter/speaker, etc. I&#8217;m not saying make a speech or 
  lecture instead. Do lecture, if that&#8217;s appropriate. Should you follow 
  the &#8220;plan,&#8221; know that even the introduction of the training itself, 
  the transitions and instructions to carry out the activities, and the overall 
  purpose and motivation for the training must be communicated effectively.</p>
<p>Why do some students love their teachers? Because they&#8217;re young and don&#8217;t 
  know any better? No, because the teachers are charismatic. They&#8217;re fun. 
  They&#8217;re themselves and the students know that. The teachers care about 
  the students and what they get out of a lesson. It should be no different with 
  training. And trainers, too.</p>
<h3>Know Your audience, Know Your Subject and Know Yourself</h3>
<p>Sounds simplistic and maybe that is the beauty of it. Knowing the audience 
  is primary to any training needs assessment, environment, implementation, and 
  plans. The same goes for the subject&#8211;tailored, of course, to your audience. 
  Then, the biggest factor, often ignored by managers and training staff: the 
  assignment of a trainer who can hold and engage the audience with the subject 
  matter.</p>
<p>To some trainers, even though they &quot;know&quot; training and development, 
  getting up in front of the group is still their biggest fear--their &quot;mission 
  impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>To some trainers, even though they know training and all the requisite tools, 
  public speaking is still their biggest fear, their &#8220;mission impossible&#8221; 
  as it is for most people. That is the reason some trainers fall back to the 
  etched-in-stone training process. Sure, the program takes into account how people 
  learn and what techniques do that best, but bottom-line for trainees is that 
  they have to care. The only way to make them care is to have someone who can 
  grab their attention, make the training meaningful and communicate the message 
  (the subject effectively). That is the job of the trainer or facilitators of 
  training. Either way, we&#8217;re going to make that &#8220;mission impossible&#8221; 
  &#8220;an affair to remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those trainers or facilitators who need help in owning the stage and being 
  more confident, I won&#8217;t just say, &#8220;practice, practice, practice.&#8221; 
  Practice is important, but there are other techniques as well. Actors know how 
  to be comfortable in their own skins as well as others. The trick is to get 
  the right help to identify who you are, and to use that knowledge effectively.</p>
<h3>Once You Know Who You Are and Why You Belong ... the Rest is Conversation 
  -- the Training Module, Made Easy</h3>
<p>Use the all the personality tools you own, the information you feel critical 
  to communicate and connect with the audience. &#8220;Owning&#8221; the moment 
  and the stage is key to alleviating public speaking/training fears. This is 
  where the knowing yourself comes in. Everyone has a unique personality and I 
  encourage them to use it. Not everyone is a dance a minute on the stage or a 
  joke teller or a witty soul. But I wouldn&#8217;t tell a cowboy about to make 
  a speech he had to take his hat off&#8211;especially if that is not who he is. 
  In essence, be yourself and use what is unique about you as you would in talking 
  with friends. Be a person. That will help the moment feel more natural&#8211;more 
  like conversation, which isn&#8217;t fearful.</p>
<h3>Communication Considerations for Trainers</h3>
<ul>
  <li> How do your get your audience&#8217;s attention and maintain it?</li>
  <li>Recognize different training groups, different approaches, different sizes 
    of training -- one size may not fit all.</li>
  <li>How do you make the trainees remember what you said? In public speaking, 
    we use storytelling and humor among other things.</li>
  <li>How do you influence your audience?</li>
  <li>Know what you need to realize the charisma you need to become a dynamic 
    and respected communicator or facilitator of training? A hint. It&#8217;s 
    already in there. In you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effective Communication Couldn&#8217;t Be More Important in Training</h3>
<p>No one should deny our purpose is for our trainees to absorb our subject matter 
  and commit to using it. Even if you have a product that sells itself you still 
  have to have get someone to pay attention to it to know they even want it. Basic 
  communication means we have information to convey and we need our audience to 
  &#8220;act&#8221; on that information (even if it is just to remember it) or 
  we wouldn&#8217;t be there in the first place.</p>
<p>Communication is about sending and receiving information. Actors are taught 
  acting and reacting&#8211;virtually the same give and take in a speaking or 
  training environment. Acting is about audience perception and our ability to 
  influence that perception. To get others to listen, to remember, to change their 
  minds or attitudes is communication.</p>
<p>Actors aren&#8217;t the only ones who need to know their audience, their subjects, 
  and themselves, trainers should, too, if they want their training sessions to 
  be &#8220;affairs to remember.&#8221; Those results are the best kind, after 
  all.</p>
<p>The most efficient training is the best communicated training.</p>
