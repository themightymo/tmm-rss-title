<h2>Preparation for Designing Your Training Plan</h2>
<p>The purpose of the design phase is to identify the learning objectives that 
  together will achieve the overall goals identified during the needs assessment 
  phase of systematic training design. You will also identify the learning activities 
  (or methods) you'll need to conduct to achieve your learning objectives and 
  overall training goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before progressing through the guidelines in this topic, the reader would 
    benefit from first reviewing the information about formal and systematic training, 
    especially the ADDIE model, at <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-isd-and-addie.htm">Formal 
    Training Processes -- Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and ADDIE</a>. </li>
  <li>Then scan the contents of the first phase of the ADDIE model systematic 
    planning of training, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/needs-assessment.htm">Training 
    Needs Assessment and Analysis: Identifying Training Goals</a>. (This design 
    phase is the second phase of the ADDIE model.)</li>
  <li>Also, note that there is a document, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm">Complete 
    Guidelines to Design Your Training Plan</a>, that condenses the guidelines 
    from the various topics about training plans to guide you to develop a training 
    plan. That document also provides a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
    to Design Your Training Plan</a> that you can use to document the various 
    aspects of your plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="anchor862083"></a> </p>
<h2>Design Your Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Learning objectives specify the new knowledge, skills and abilities that a 
  learner should accomplish from undertaking a learning experience, such as a 
  course, webinar, self-study or group activity. Achievement of all of the learning 
  objectives should result in accomplishing all of the overall training goals 
  of the training and development experience(s).</p>
<h3>Understand the Alignment, Dimensions and Terms in Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>The following table depicts how learning objectives are associated with the 
  training goals (identified during the needs assessment phase), learning methods/activities, 
  evidence of learning and evaluation activities. .</p>
<p></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5">

      3. delegate to a certain employee for one month<br />

<h3>Examples to Convey Nature of Well-Written Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>To help learners understand how to design learning objectives, the following 
  examples are offered to convey the nature of learning objectives. The examples 
  are <i>not</i> meant to be offered as examples to be adopted word-for-word as 
  learning objectives. Trainers and/or learners should design their own learning 
  objectives to meet their overall training goals and to match their preferred 
  strategies for learning. The topic of the learning objective is included in

<h2><a name="analyze" id="analyze"></a>Analyze Your Learning Objectives for Relevance, 
  Alignment, Sequence and Testability</h2>
<h3><b>1. What Sequence Should the Objectives Be Achieved?</b> </h3>
<p>Usually, learning builds on learning. It may be useful to learn certain areas 
  of knowledge and skills before learning new areas.</p>
<h3><b>2. Will the Objectives Achieve the Overall Training Goal(s)?</b></h3>
<p>Now you're read to write down your learning objectives in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>
<h3><b>3. What Are the Best Learning Activities to Achieve the Objectives?</b></h3>
<p>Do the methods match the learners' particular learning styles, for example,, 
  reading, doing or listening? Do the methods stretch their styles, too? Are the 
  methods readily accessible? Do the methods take advantage of real-life learning 
  opportunities, for example,, use on-the-job training opportunities, real-life 
  problems that occur at work, use projects and programs at work? Note that learning 
  activities do always match learning objectives on a one-for-one basis. You might 
  benefit from the following links, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm#anchor931247">Some 
  Typical Ways of Learning</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm#anchor789424">Some 
  New Ways of Learning in the Workplace</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/learning-styles.htm">Learning 
  Style Inventory</a>.)</p>
<h3><b>4. Do the Activities Include Ongoing Reflections About Learning?</b></h3>
<p>The learners will benefit from regularly taking time to stand back and inquire 
  about what is going on in the training, what are they learning and what, if 
  anything, should be changed. Skills in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/types-of-learning.htm#anchor8461">reflection</a> 
  are critical for ongoing learning in life and work. Consider using a <a 
  href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/journaling.htm">private learning 
  journal</a>. Now you're read to write down the learning activities in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>
<h3><b>5. What Results, or Evidence of Learning, Will Be Produced?</b></h3>
<p>For ideas about what results to design into your plan, see <a
  href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/results-to-evaluate.htm">Samples of Learner's 
  Results as Means to Verify Learning.</a> Now you're ready to write down your 
  evidence of learning in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>
<h3><b>6. Who Will Verify That Each of the Learning Objectives Was Reached?</b></h3>
<p>Ideally, the learning is evaluated by someone who has strong expertise in the 
  areas of knowledge and skills required to achieve the training goals. Now you're 
  ready to write down your evaluator in the <a ref="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>
<h3><b>7. What Costs Will Be Associated With Developing and Implementing Your 
  Plan?</b></h3>
<p>Think about facilities, technologies, personnel, special expertise, etc. You 
  may want to update the &quot;Budget&quot; section in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/framework-for-training-plan.htm">Framework 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a>.</p>
<h3><b>8. How Will Learners' Manage Time and Stress During the Learning?</b></h3>
<p>Professional development inherently includes the need for self-development, 
  as well. Therefore, you might consider information in the sections<br />
