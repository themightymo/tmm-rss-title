<h2><a name="close" id="close"></a>Close Relationship Between Systematic Approaches 
  to Training and Performance Management </h2>
<p>Readers who have read <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/index.htm">Performance 
  Management: An Overview</a> in this library will note the similarity between 
  the processes of systematic training and performance management. The results 
  from implementing the two processes are highly integrated as well. That's why 
  if a supervisor uses good principles of performance management then training 
  and development can be a straightforward activity which almost always contribute 
  to the organization's bottom line.</p>

<p>The performance management process is repeated below from the
library section, Performance Management. When reviewing the steps
below, think of the word &quot;domain&quot; as applying to the
employee being trained. Comments are added in italics. The words
&quot;employee&quot; and &quot;learner&quot; are used interchangeably.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review organizational goals to associate preferred organizational results 
    in terms of units of performance, that is, quantity, quality, cost or timeliness 
    (note that the result itself is therefore a measure) - <i>Reviewing these 
    goals will prepare the supervisor and employee for soon ensuring that training 
    produces useful results for the organization. Implementing a good training 
    plan will produce results for the organization.</i></li>
  <li>Specify desired results for the domain -- as guidance, focus on results 
    needed by other domains (e.g., products or services need by internal or external 
    customers) - <i>The training process should have specific learning goals to 
    accomplish which, in turn, help the learner accomplish specific results.</i></li>
  <li>Ensure the domain's desired results directly contribute to the organization's 
    result <i>-- A good training plan must be geared to help the employee produce 
    specific results, which in turn, directly contribute to results needed by 
    the organization</i></li>
  <li>Weight, or prioritize, the domain's desired results <i>- Knowing what range 
    of results are needed from the employee and which are the most important, 
    helps the supervisor and employee to pick what training is needed and when.</i></li>
  <li>Identify first-level measures to evaluate if and how well the domain's desired 
    results were achieved - <i>This refinement of expected results from the employee 
    helps the supervisor and employee to ensure that training is highly focused 
    on results for the employee -- and organization. this step is similar to setting 
    standards against which the training will be evaluated</i></li>
  <li>Identify more specific measures for each first-level measure if necessary 
    - <i>This step is similar to setting up-front training goals in the training 
    plan, and associating measures from which the effectiveness of training can 
    later be evaluated.</i></li>
  <li>Identify standards for evaluating how well the desired results were achieved 
    (e.g., &quot;below expectations&quot;, &quot;meets expectations&quot; and 
    &quot;exceeds expectations&quot;)</li>
  <li>Document a performance plan -- including desired results, measures and standards 
    - <i>This is similar to developing the training plan, with preferred training 
    goals and measures.</i></li>
  <li>Conduct ongoing observations and measurements to track performance - <i>The 
    training plan is implemented and includes ongoing evaluation before, during 
    and after carrying out training methods.</i></li>
  <li>Exchange ongoing feedback about performance - <i>Effective training requires 
    ongoing feedback between learners and trainer.</i></li>
  <li>Conduct a performance appraisal (sometimes called performance review) - 
    <i>Effective training includes evaluation to judge the quality of the training 
    itself and identify what results were achieved by learners.</i></li>
  <li>If performance meets the desired performance standard, then reward for performance 
    (the nature of the reward depends on the domain) - <i>Hopefully, the learning 
    experience includes time to acknowledge successes and the trainers' and learners' 
    roles in those successes.</i></li>
  <li>If performance does not meet performance standards, develop or update a 
    performance development plan - <i>A good training plan will include measures 
    for noting changes in the employee's performance. If improvement is needed, 
    a performance plan should be updated or started, and may include cause for 
    more training. Likewise, the trainer should review results of learners' evaluations 
    to improve the quality of his or her training design.</i></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="perconsulting" id="perconsulting"></a>Performance Consulting</h2>
<p>Performance consulting is relatively recent field and refers to the (ideally) 
  systematic activities to enhance the performance on individuals (and some would 
  say teams), especially to enhance the performance of the overall organization. 
  The activities often include systematic approaches to the design and implementation 
  of training programs. Thus, performance consulting and training often are closely 
  related and referred together in literature. </p>

<h2><a name="hpt" id="hpt"></a>Human Performance Technology</h2>
<p>Many people believe that traditional views of training, for example, to enhance 
  learning (knowledge, skills and abilities of individuals) is not enough -- that 
  training and learning must be more closely aligned to achieving the goals of 
  the organization. Simply put, Human Performance Technology (HPT) uses instructional 
  technologies to improve the performance of individuals, especially regarding 
  organizational performance (effective and efficient achievement of organizational 
  goals). HPT has developed numerous, often highly technical, theories, models 
  and tools to enhance performance. Thus, the &quot;technology&quot; in HPT. </p>
