<h2><a name="are" id="are"></a>Are Corporate Universities the Answer?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://actingsmarts.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Jack Shaw</a></p>

<p>In any discussion of educating or training our young, we must talk about both 
  education and training. We want our managers, and certainly our CEOs, COOs, 
  CFOs, CTOs, and quite a few others to have impressive degrees and from impressive 
  institutions of higher learning. The levels have changed over the years. A long 
  time ago, a college-educated man was rare, and he could rise to the top of the 
  corporate ladder. It mattered what school. Then it was ratcheted up a notch 
  so the higher-ups had masters degrees, then MBAs, and then later they had to 
  be from the prestigious business colleges a well--with the MBA.</p>
<p> The chief complaint: our institutions of higher learning were simply not putting 
  out the graduates capable of going into a company and being ready to go to work. 
  Hence, the development of the means of which to take those new employees and 
  train them in the company or industry-specific areas.</p>
<p>That's not to say those requirements weren't needed as the world became a more 
  complicated place. As business became more worldly, it took a sophistication 
  requiring well-educated individuals who could operate in the broader context; 
  however, business is still &quot;nuts and bolt&quot;s so it had to develop requirements 
  separate from those at other levels where education wasn't enough to get you 
  in the door; you needed special skills besides--and experience. As everyone 
  focused on getting the education to get the degrees that opened doors, someone 
  had to say, &quot;who's going to do the work.&quot; Who is going to be the backbone 
  of the company.&quot; Mr. Ivy League School? Mr. Premiere Business Institution? 
  Mr. Prestigious Law School? And, to attack that glass ceiling, the ladies had 
  to do the same and more.</p>
<p>Still, discussions in the community are centered around how to attract qualified 
  workers to do the work-work. Can't find them here, some companies go overseas, 
  where workers are cheaper and are willing to learn your business and will pay 
  for the opportunity. Oops! You go where you can find qualified workers or you 
  don't grow or succeed. Workers overseas don't often have the options of the 
  right schools to get them in the door. Next best thing: corporate universities. 
  Can we develop our home-grown workers? We'd like to. For the right price.</p>
<p>No one was saying forget higher education and concentrate on the practical, 
  but it would have made the job of finding workers easier if someone could walk 
  in off the street and immediately go to work. Granted there are some sharp individuals 
  who can do that, but only in very remote instances.</p>
<p>Of course, if they could all walk off the campus and go to work, where would 
  we trainers be?</p>
<p> Make it specific to the company's needs and ta-da!--a corporate university. 
  Apparently they work. Look around any industrial area and you'll find institutions 
  of higher training, better known as Corporate Universities.</p>
<p>So, now that we have education and are willing to take only a certain level 
  of a job because we have that education, what now?</p>
<p>David Baucus and Melissa Baucus authored a piece, titled <a href="http://innovateonline.info/pdf/vol1_issue5/The_Changing_Shape_of_Corporate_Universities.pdf" target="_blank">The 
  Changing Shape of Corporate Universities</a>. The gist of the article is how 
  the e-learning and corporate universities we know today grew out of the technological 
  innovation that came several years back. They say that there is no doubt that 
  the e-learning industry--a part of that technological innovation--contributed 
  to the growth of corporate universities. Both authors have the education to 
  tell us this authoritatively. Check their website and bios to be sure.</p>
<p>&quot;Early in the evolution of the industry, corporate universities represented 
  a reasonable deployment of learning technologies. They enabled companies to 
  deliver the right content to target markets (e.g., employees, partners, and 
  customers) and to reduce training costs by substituting technology for labor.&quot;</p>
<p>Many years ago before the article above was written and when I was teaching 
  at a small proprietary college in Virginia, I remember sitting on a committee 
  looking at the direct education and placement of students in the workplace. 
  The committee was made up of educators, trainers, business, corporate and community 
  leaders all looking at what education could do in the world of work. The little 
  guys can't afford to create a corporate university. No longer were we talking 
  about the value of general education, but how we could mold future workers, 
  managers, and leaders of the business and corporate world. Education alone wasn't 
  the answer.</p>

  out the graduates capable of going into a company and being ready to go to work. 
  Hence, the development of the means of which to take those new employees and 
  train them in the company or industry-specific areas.</p>
<p>Bring in the trainers and the technology. Make it specific to the company's 
  needs and ta-da!--a corporate university. Of course, it's not that simple, but 
  apparently they work. Look around any industrial area and you'll find institutions 
  of higher training, better known as Corporate Universities. McDonald's Hamburger 
  University, Motorola University, Boeing University, TD Bank University, Pfizer 
  University, Trump Institute--to name a few. Some are well-established, and some 
  are new to the scene. Look around your own neighborhood. Pretty much any large 
  corporation will have one. In 1997, there were around 400 in existence in the 
  U.S.; today that number in the thousands changes daily, and they are also worldwide. 
  Like it or not, they will soon eclipse regular institutions of higher learning 
  in number.</p>
<p>Technological innovation wasn't responsible for it alone. We grew up and we 
  grew wide. We became international. We can communicate and operate around the 
  world without leaving out desks. It's a good thing we can concentrate what we 
  know about the company in one place; however, we should probably do it with 
  an eye toward broadening our awareness of other companies and what they do and 
  how they differ. Mergers are commonplace. Companies don't just change names; 
  they change focus; they expand.</p>
<p>Training programs should expand or at least be expandable. (Trainers everywhere 
  are rejoicing, and not just those who work for a corporate university.) There 
  are joint university and corporate university projects in all areas of the business 
  and corporate world. There are corporate universities within traditional universities. 
  There are universities that exist only online. Not the correspondence schools 
  or diploma mills of the past, but the basic idea of long distance learning--only 
  bigger, and hopefully improved. As the educators mulled over the problems of 
  putting graduates directly in the workplace, I suspect they weren't sitting 
  on their hands either; this is bigger than business alone. It's our economy, 
  our very lives at stake. Our GNP and the stability of our currency in the world 
  economy. We are dominoes in this affecting economies internationally. If those 
  dots are eyes, they need to be wide open.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts on corporate universities and the world. Broad topic. What 
  are your thoughts? For more of my hopefully not-so-crazy thoughts, check out 
  my website. I have more to say on training, on communication, on performance, 
  and even on theatre arts, but I can only be in one place at one time.</p>

<p>It seems an increasing number of companies are forming their own &quot;corporate 
  training universities&quot;, often in collaboration with nearby traditional 
  academic universities. The following links will get you to the largest collections
