<h2><a name="orient" id="orient"></a>Start With Effective Employee Orientation</h2>
<p>The new employee orientation is the first time that employees get an impression 
  of the quality of the organization and the nature of the relationship that he 
  or she will have with his or her supervisor. (Research has shown the one of 
  the biggest reasons that employees quick their jobs is because of poor relationships 
  with their supervisors.) As a supervisor, you can make a very positive impression 
  during the orientation, including about how you value the employee's training 
  and development. An orientation session is, after all, a training and development 
  session. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/employee-orientation.htm"><br />
  Orienting New Employees</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="myths" id="myths"></a>Understand Common Myths About Employee Training 
  and Development</h2>
<p>The following are rather common myths, or misunderstandings, among new supervisors, 
  particularly if they don't understand the basics of good training and development.</p>
<h3> Myth: Employees already have the knowledge and skills to do their jobs - 
  that's why they were hired.</h3>
<p>Unless employee's jobs involve their doing the same things all the time, employees 
  will need to be trained to learn new knowledge and skills. It's hard to accept 
  that any job will stay the same all the time with today's increasing competition 
  and the increasing demands of their customers. Besides, because someone was 
  hired doesn't mean they have the best knowledge and skills to do the best job 
  for the company.</p>
<h3>Myth: Our employee's jobs are so specialized that no one else knows them better 
  than us, so no one else can teach them to us.</h3>
<p>Every job is unique. The job is being carried out in one company in one location 
  at one time with unique people. Because a job is unique does not mean that the 
  company should never seek help elsewhere. Unless an employee is performing a 
  highly routine task on a highly customized machine, the trainer or consultant 
  doesn't have to know exactly what a job entails and all about who is carrying 
  out the job. The point of training and development is to work with learners 
  to develop new knowledge and skills. Highly effective training includes teaching 
  the learner how to learn, including how to come up with new ideas and approaches. 
  Besides, organizations usually have a lot more in common with other organizations 
  then employees realize.</p>
<h3>Myth: If employees need new knowledge or skills, they'll know about it faster 
  than anyone else. They'll know better than anyone else where to get the learning 
  they need.</h3>
<p>Busy employees are usually the last people to know what they don't know -- 
  what they need to learn. Few organizations afford employees the time and guidance 
  to reflect on what they're doing, to learn new ideas and establish new approaches. 
  Employees are experts at doing their jobs the way that they do their jobs. If 
  they're doing their jobs inefficiently, they're experts at doing their jobs 
  inefficiently.</p>
<h3>Myth: If employees attended a course, then they learned what the organization 
  needed.</h3>
<p>Courses are not quick fixes. After years of classroom education, most of us 
  automatically think of learning as going to a course. We go down the list of 
  courses in the training catalog, pick the title that seems closest to what we're 
  doing and we sign up for the course. Many supervisors work the same way. If 
  their employees are struggling (often for numerous reasons), they'll pick what 
  sounds like the best course from the list and off the employees go to that course. 
  Many times, supervisors leave it up to the employees to get the most out of 
  the course and then to come back &quot;fixed&quot; -- after all, &quot;they're 
  professionals&quot;.</p>
<p> After an employee comes back from a course, all one can really say for sure 
  is that they came back from a course. However, there are several basic things 
  a supervisor and employee can do to ensure the right form of training is selected 
  and that the training provides results in the workplace. (These suggestions 
  are included throughout this topic in the library.) Besides, taking a course 
  is only one of the many ways in which employees can learn.</p>
<h3>Myth: (The following myth seems to be on the rise) There's no use sending 
  employees to a course. They'll just come back with a book to store on their 
  shelf.</h3>
<p>The perception that training is a waste of time is tragic. The reasons for 
  this myth are many. Some employees don't make the effort to learn, to actually 
  apply new materials and information in order to learn. Many people don't have 
  the ability or desire to reference materials from course materials long after 
  a course is over. Some trainers oversell their courses, promising huge outcomes 
  but not delivering on their promises. After many years, sitting in classrooms, 
  listening to experts and taking notes, many of us think that merely going in 
  and out of a classroom means learning. Many of us are not conditioned to really 
  think about what we need to learn, how will we learn it and how will we know 
  that we've learned it.<br />

<h2>What Supervisors Can Do to Support
Their Employees in Training and Development</h2>

<h3>Include Learners in Training and Development Planning</h3>

<p>The learner will get the most out of the plan is he or she
feels strong ownership in the plan. Ownership comes from taking
part in developing the plan. Also, professional development rarely
includes only gaining knowledge and skills about a job role. Professional
development often includes self-development, as well, e.g., admitting
one's limits and capabilities. Learners are often the best experts
at realizing their own needs for self-development. Therefore,
learners should be involved in as much as possible in developing
the plan.</p>

<h3>If Available, Have Human Resources Representative Play Major
Role</h3>

<p>A trained human resources professional can be a major benefit
in employee development. The representative usually has a good
understanding of the dynamics of training and development. The
representative often has strong working knowledge of the relevant
policies and procedures related to training and development. In
addition, the representative can an be an impartial confidant
for the learner.</p>

<h3>Provide Ongoing Feedback and Support</h3>

<p>Even if things seem to be going fine, be sure to stop in and
visit the learner on a regular basis. Some learners may not feel
comfortable asking for help. Supervisors should provide any feedback,
that is, timely and useful information for the learner. Provide
ongoing affirmation and support.</p>

<h3>When Assessing Results of Employee's Learning, Maximize Feedback
About Performance</h3>

<p>Consider getting feedback from the learner's peers and subordinates
about the learner's needs and progress to meet those needs. A
360-degree performance review is a powerful practice when carried
out with clarity and discretion. When first carried out, it may
be wise to get the help of an outside professional.</p>

<h3>Budget Necessary Funds for Resources Learner Will Need</h3>

<p>Funds may be required, e.g., for course tuition and materials,
self-study materials, videos, training fees, labor to attend courses,
etc.</p>

<h3>Supervisor and Learner Should Set Aside Regular Times for
Meetings</h3>

<p>Scheduling meetings beforehand makes it much more likely that regular, ongoing 
  feedback will occur between the supervisor and learner.</p>
<h2><a name="help" id="help"></a>How Supervisors Can Help Employees Learn in the 
  Workplace</h2>
<p>The supervisor's attitude and knowledge about learning has a tremendous impact 
  on the development of employees (thus, the major reason the Free Management 
  Library was developed). Thomas D. Fisher, in <i>Self-Directedness in the Workplace: 
  A Re-Examination</i>, cites numerous suggestions (from Lowry) in order to better 
  enable self-directed learning in the workplace. Some of those suggestions are 
  listed below, and are wonderful ways for supervisors and learners to turn the 
  workplace into a classroom (pp. 4-5):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Help the learner identify the starting point for a learning project and 
    discern relevant [ways!] of examination and reporting.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Encourage adult learners to view knowledge and truth as contextual ... and 
    that they can act on their world individually or collectively to transform 
    it<br />
  </li>
  <li>Create a partnership with the learner by negotiating a learning contract 
    for goals, strategies and evaluation criteria<br />
  </li>
  <li>Be a manager of the learning experience rather than an information provider<br />
  </li>
  <li>Teach inquiry skills, decision making, personal development, and self-evaluation 
    of work<br />
  </li>
  <li>Help learners develop positive attitudes and feelings of independence relative 
    to learning<br />
  </li>
  <li>Recognize learners' personality types and learning styles<br />
  </li>
  <li>Use techniques such as field experience and problem solving that take advantage 
    of adults' rich experience base<br />
  </li>
  <li>Encourage critical thinking skills by incorporating ... such activities 
    as seminars<br />
  </li>
  <li>Create an atmosphere of openness and trust to promote better performance<br />
  </li>
  <li>Behave ethically, which includes not recommending a self-directed learning 
    approach if it is not congruent with the learner's needs<br />
  </li>
  <li>Obtain the necessary tools to assess learner's current performance and to 
    evaluate their expected performance<br />
  </li>
  <li>Provide opportunities for self-directed learners to reflect on what they're 
    learning<br />
  </li>
  <li>Promote learning networks, study circles, and learning exchanges, self-managed 
    teams of self-directed learners)<br />
  </li>
  <li>Provide staff training on self-directed learning and broaden the opportunities 
    for its implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>Fisher adds that &quot;Self-directed learning is more than a form of education. 
  It is a component in human development&quot; (p. 7).<br />

<h2>How Leaders and Managers Can Help Train Other Leaders and Managers</h2>
<p>State-of-the-art training and development programs often includes roles for 
  leaders and managers to train other leaders and managers. After all, all of 
  them ultimately are responsible for implementing that new learning. No matter 
  how skilled a trainer is, he or she can never know the culture and needs of 
  an organization as much as its leaders and managers. </p>
