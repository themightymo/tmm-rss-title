<h1>Role of Learners in Training and Development</h1>

<h2>Learning is Ultimately the Learner's Responsibility</h2>
<p>Regardless of the situation, learning is ultimately the individual's responsibility. 
  Learning will not succeed unless the individual feels a strong sense of ownership 
  and responsibility in the process itself. The best forms of learning involve 
  the complete individual, including his or her approach to personal organization 
  and wellness.</p>
<h2>To Learn, You Must Be Willing to Grow, to Experience</h2>

<p>Learning often involves new skills, developing new behaviors.
After many years of classroom education, it's easy for us to take
a course where all we must do is attend each meeting, take notes
and pass tests -- and call this learning. One can complete a Masters
in Business Administration (MBA), but unless they're willing to
actually <i>apply</i> new information, they'll most likely end
up with an office full of unreferenced textbooks and a head full
of data, but little knowledge and wisdom. For the learning process
to succeed, the individual must be willing to take risks. Stick
you neck out, including by telling the instructor when you're
confused or disappointed in the course. Don't wait until the course
is over when nothing can be done about it.</p>

<h2>Growth Involves the Entire Learner</h2>

<p>If learning is to be more than collecting new information,
then we must involve ourselves completely in our learning experiences.
Unfortunately, too many development programs still operate from
the assumption that the learner can somehow separate personal
development from professional development. So we end up getting
a great deal of information about finance and sales, but little
help with stress and time management. Then, after schooling, when
we enter the hectic world of management, we struggle to keep perspective
and we're plagued with self doubts. True learning involves looking
at every aspect of our lives, not just what's in our heads. So
include courses, e.g., in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/time-stress-management.htm">Stress
Management</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/personalwellness/emotional-intelligence.htm">Emotional
Intelligence</a>, in your training and development plans.</p>

<h2>Growth Requires Seeking Ongoing Feedback</h2>

<p>Many of us don't know what we need to learn -- we don't know
what we don't know. Therefore, feedback from others is critical
to understanding ourselves and our jobs. Feedback is useful in
more ways than telling us what we don't know. Feedback also deepens
and enriches what we do know. Research indicates that adults learn
new information and methods best when they a) actually <i>apply</i>
the information and methods, and b) exchange feedback around
those experiences. However, we're often reluctant to seek advice
and impressions from others, particularly fellow workers. We're
sometimes reluctant to share feedback with others, as well. The
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/feedback.htm">Giving
and Receiving Feedback</a> might be useful to you.</p>

<p>The courage to overcome our reluctance and fears is often the first step toward 
  achieving true meaning in our lives and our jobs.</p>
<h2>Growth Involves Realistic Expectations</h2>
<p>There is a vast amount of management literature today, much of it asserting 
  the need for substantial and continued change. We're expected to achieve total 
  quality and total integrity. We're encouraged to transform ourselves and our 
  organizations. Courses and workshops promise a wide range of outcomes and useful 
  skills. It's easy in today's hectic and frustrating world to want a course or 
  workshop to take care of all of our problems. True development is a process, 
  more than an outcome. Many of us want to measure our growth along the way by 
  setting objectives to accomplish. We must ensure these objectives are realistic 
  -- or we're faced with despair and cynicism about our work and learning.</p>
<h2>Trust Your Instincts to Learn</h2>

<p>Learning doesn't come only from other people telling you what
you need to know and how you need to learn it! The highly motivated,
self-directed learner can make a &quot;classroom of life&quot;.
Everything becomes an experience from which to learn. You can
design your own learning experiences! Think about what you want
to learn, how you might learn it and how you'll know if you've
learned it. You can get a great deal from this <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/">Free
Management Library</a>. For example, take a half hour a week to
review materials in the library. You'll get a strong (free) sense
about management. Glance at topics in the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/index.htm">Personal
