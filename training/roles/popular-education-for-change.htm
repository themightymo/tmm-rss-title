<p>Popular and folk education supports social change for social
justice by enhancing people's consciousness about their roles,
helping them cultivate vision for change and helping them identify
strategies to accomplish change. Two of the leading innovators
are Paulo Freire (who is responsible for the literacy training
of probably more people than anyone else in the world) and Myles
Horton (who started the Highlander Folk School, attended by Rosa
Parks and supported by Martin Luther King, Andrew Young, etc.)<br />
