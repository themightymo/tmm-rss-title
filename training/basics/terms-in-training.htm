<h2>Basic Terms and Definitions</h2>

<p>Note that trainers, developers and educators vary among their
own definitions of the following terms, as you can see in <a 
href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Education-Versus-Training&id=299318"
target="_blank">Education vs. Training</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor870586"></a></p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>At its most basic form, a piece of information about something
is a &quot;unit of awareness&quot; about that thing. (A field
of philosophy, epistemology, includes analysis of what is really
information and what isn't. This field might visit the question:
&quot;If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?&quot;)
Some people think that this awareness occurs only in the brain
and, therefore, usually comes from some form of thought. Other
people also accept information as a form of realization from other
forms of inquiry, e.g., intuition.</p>

<p><a name="anchor870223"></a></p>

<h3>Knowledge</h3>

<p>Knowledge is gleaned by organizing information. Typically,
information evolves to knowledge by the learner's gaining context,
perspective and scope about the information.</p>

<p><a name="anchor870000"></a></p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>Skills are applying knowledge in an effective and efficient
manner to get something done. One notices skills in an employee
by their behaviors.</p>

<p><a name="anchor976603"></a></p>

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>A task is a typically defined as a unit of work, that is, a
set of activities needed to produce some result, e.g., vacuuming
a carpet, writing a memo, sorting the mail, etc. Complex positions
in the organization may include a large number of tasks, which
are sometimes referred to as functions.</p>

<p><a name="anchor976840"></a></p>

<h3>Job</h3>

<p>A job is a collection of tasks and responsibilities that an
employee is responsible to conduct. Jobs have titles.</p>

<p><a name="anchor974721"></a></p>

<h3>Role</h3>

<p>A role is the set of responsibilities or expected results associated
with a job. A job usually includes several roles.</p>

<p><a name="anchor4293548783"></a></p>

<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>Typically, learning is viewed as enhancing one's knowledge,
understanding or skills. Some people see learning as enhancement
to one's knowledge, awareness and skills. Some professionals view
learning as enhancing one's capacity to perform. Some view learning
as a way of being that includes strong value on receiving feedback
and increasing understanding. It's important to note that learning
is more than collecting information -- more than collecting unreferenced
books on a shelf. Depending on the needs of the learner, knowledge
is converted to skills, that is, the learner knows how to apply
the knowledge to get something done. Ideally, the skills are applied
to the most appropriate tasks and practices in the organization,
thereby producing performance -- results needed by the organization.

target="_blank">another perspective</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor9243"></a></p>

<h3>Continuous Learning</h3>

<p>Simply put, continuous learning is the ability to learn to
learn. Learning need not be a linear event where a learner goes
to a formal learning program, gains areas of knowledge and skills
about a process, and then the learning ceases. If the learner
can view life (including work) as a &quot;learning program&quot;,
then the learner can continue to learn from almost everything
in life. As a result, the learner continues to expand his or her
capacity for living, including working. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Continuous
Learning</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="anchor4293547685"></a></p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>This term is often interpreted as the activity when an expert
and learner work together to effectively transfer information
from the expert to the learner (to enhance a learner's knowledge,
attitudes or skills) so the learner can better perform a current
task or job. Here's <a class="textlink" href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sat1.html#defined"
target="_blank">another perspective</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor597015"></a></p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>This term seems to be the most general of the key terms in
employee training. Some professionals view education as accomplishing
a personal context and understanding of the world, so that one's
life and work are substantially enhanced, e.g., &quot;Go get an
education.&quot; Others view the term as the learning required
to accomplish a new task or job. Here's <a class="textlink" href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sat1.html#tde"
target="_blank">another perspective</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor4293548447"></a></p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>This term is often viewed as a broad, ongoing multi-faceted
set of activities (training activities among them) to bring someone
or an organization up to another threshold of performance. This
development often includes a wide variety of methods, e.g., orienting
about a role, training in a wide variety of areas, ongoing training
on the job, coaching, mentoring and forms of self-development.
Some view development as a life-long goal and experience. Here's
<a class="textlink" href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sat1.html#tde" target="_blank">another
perspective</a>.</p>
