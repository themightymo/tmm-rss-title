<p>(As a brief review of terms, training involves an expert working with learners 
  to transfer to them certain areas of knowledge or skills to improve in their 
  current jobs. Development is a broad, ongoing multi-faceted set of activities 
  (training activities among them) to bring someone or an organization up to another 
  threshold of performance, often to perform some job or new role in the future.)</p>

<h2>Typical Reasons for Employee Training and Development</h2>

<p>Training and development can be initiated for a variety of reasons for an employee 
  or group of employees, e.g.,:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a performance appraisal indicates performance improvement
  is needed</li>
  <li>To &quot;benchmark&quot; the status of improvement so far
  in a performance improvement effort</li>
  <li>As part of an overall professional development program</li>
  <li>As part of succession planning to help an employee be eligible
  for a planned change in role in the organization</li>
  <li>To &quot;pilot&quot;, or test, the operation of a new performance
  management system</li>
  <li>To train about a specific topic (see below)
</ul>
