<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NOTE: The following considerations are meant to round out the
vast advice offered in the section <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">Overview
of Training and Development</a>. These considerations do <b>not</b>
replace information in that section. This framework should not
be used without having first read that section.</p>

<p>As previously noted, training and development can be initiated
to address a &quot;performance gap&quot; (learning needed to meet
performance standards for a current task or job), &quot;growth
gap&quot; (learning needed to achieve career goals) or &quot;opportunity
gap&quot; (learning needed to qualify for an identified new job
or role). The following considerations apply to any of these situations.</p>

<p>The information frequently references supervisors and employees/learners.
However, information also applies to learners wanting to develop
their own training and development plan.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;employee&quot; and &quot;learner&quot; are
used interchangeably in the following.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1688405"></a></p>

<h2>Planning - Some Considerations When Developing the Plan</h2>

<h3>Be Sure to Document a Training and Development Plan (Goals,
Methods and Evaluation)</h3>

<p>Carefully consider using some form of a training and development
plan, even if thinking about informal means of training and development.
Sketching out a plan with goals, intended methods and evaluation,
will at least give you a sense of what you want and how you'll
recognize if you've gotten it or not. Don't expect perfection
in the plan or the learner. Start simple, but start. Then update
the plan as you go along.</p>

<h3>Don't Worry About Whether Your Plan is Perfect or Not -- The
Plan is Guide, Not Law</h3>

<p>The key is to get started. Start simple, but start. Do the
best that you can for now. There is no perfect plan. You're doing
the plan according to your nature and needs.</p>

<p>Also, it's not important to stick to the plan for the sake
of the plan. Deviations from the plan are to be expected. It's
important that deviations are recognized and explained.</p>

<h3>Remember that Development is a Process</h3>

<p>Often, the ongoing reflection and discussions between supervisor
and learner are far more important than results produced by learners
during the training and development process. Appreciate this interaction
as much as reaching any objectives in the plan.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1689522"></a></p>

<h2>Goals - Selecting Training and Development Goals</h2>

<h3>Select 2-4 Goals to Get Started</h3>

<p>Each of these goals will be associated with, e.g., 2-4, learning
objectives that when reached by the learner will result in the
learner reaching the overall training goal. (More about learning
objectives later in a basic framework for developing a training
and development plan.)</p>

<h3>Determine the Goals Yourself -- Don't Adopt Them from Another
Program, Writer, etc.</h3>

<p>It's very tempting to get a copy of a formal training program's
goals and make them your own. It's very tempting to read a writer's
suggestions about what a leader should be and adopt those suggestions
as requirements in your program. Almost everyone wants to have
more character, be charismatic, be more visionary, work well with
groups, be more communicative, support followers, etc.</p>

<p><i>But you may very well have already have met those goals!</i>
Because writer's suggestions sounds very virtuous, e.g., to
have more character, does not mean that you don't already have
a great deal of character that already incorporates the values
needed for strong and effective leadership in your organization.</p>

<p>Therefore, give careful thought to your training and development
goals. Ultimately, you and your supervisor are the best judges
of what you should aim to learn.</p>

<h3>Set Realistic Expectations</h3>

<p>As explained in previous information about Training Analysis,
learning goals should be established based on needed areas of
knowledge and skills. These needs are established by referencing
relevant strategic goals, competencies lists, job descriptions,
job analysis, tasks analysis, etc. Be sure these goals are realistic.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of management literature today, much
of it asserting the need for continued change among organizations
and employees. Often, we're expected to achieve total quality
and total integrity. We're encouraged to transform ourselves and
our organizations. These expectations can serve as powerful visions
to provide direction and purpose. However, as these expectations
become strong requirements in the workplace, they must be carefully
considered and planned. Otherwise, they can spawn a great deal
of despair and cynicism.. Consequently, be realistic about training
and development plans. Particularly regarding development efforts
such as leadership development, it can be very seductive to have
goals such as &quot;total integrity&quot;. If you want &quot;total
integrity&quot; as a goal, know what behaviors will depict total
integrity and then identify those behaviors in your training and
development plan.</p>

<h3>Don't Forget the Most Important Sources of Suggestions Supervisors
and Subordinates</h3>

<p>When selecting training and development goals, ask your supervisor
for feedback. For example, if you're planning a leadership development
program for yourself, ask your supervisor for suggestions about
how you could improve. He or she may be the best person to give
you ideas for goals and methods. He or she has had to develop
leadership skills and also has watched you over the years. Also,
don't forget to ask your subordinates for suggestions. They often
have impressions about you that you'll never find out about, unless
you ask for them.</p>

<h3>Integrate Results Expected from the Learner with Goals in
the Performance Plan</h3>

<p>Include the training and development goals in the performance
review planning and discussions. This affords ongoing tracking
and discussion to ensure that training and development results
are actually carried over into the results in the workplace. If
the supervisor and employee have been conducting the employee
performance management process and perceived a &quot;performance
gap&quot;, then the performance review process already includes
the goals needed by the training and development plan. &quot;Growth
gap&quot; and &quot;opportunity gap&quot; training goals should
also be included in the performance review process as career development
goals to ensure ongoing tracking and discussion. However, be very
careful about evaluating the employee on whether they achieved
career goals or not. Many variables can occur which hamper the
employee from achieving career goals. Instead, focus performance
evaluations on achievement of performance standards.</p>

<p><a name="anchor2048356"></a></p>

<h2>Methods - Remember Basic Principles About Adult Learning</h2>

<h3>Adults Learn Best by Applying Information to Current, Real-World
Needs</h3>

<p>Therefore, select training and development methods that include
the learner's actually applying new information and methods in
the workplace to a real-life problem. It's often difficult for
learners to translate discussion about simulated situations (e.g.,
case studies) back to the workplace. On-the-job training can be
very powerful when complemented with new information and methods,
and time for reflection.</p>

<h3>Adults Learn Best by Exchanging Feedback About Experiences</h3>

<p>Learners benefit a great deal from ongoing feedback around
their experiences when applying new information and materials.
Ideally, training and development experiences afford learners
the opportunity to describe the results of applying new information
and methods, what they thought would happen, what actually happened
and why, and what the learner gained from the experience.</p>

<p><a name="anchor2070921"></a></p>

<h2>Methods - Some Basic Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p>Particularly after 12 to 16 years of classroom education, we
tend to fall prey to several common myths about training and development.
The following advice is geared to help learners avoid those myths.<br />
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Don't mistake data and information for knowledge and wisdom</b>.<br />
  Too often, when we want to learn something, we take a course,
  carefully analyze the material and consider ourselves as having
  learned the information. Yet how much of the material from our
  courses have we really practiced? Paulo Freire, who is probably
  responsible for educating more human beings than anyone in history,
  asserts that &#147;without practice, there is no knowledge&#148;.</li>
  <li><b>Don't mistake entertainment for enlightenment</b>.<br />
  Go to your library, look at the hundreds, maybe thousands of
  books there. How many did you really need? How much of the authors'
  advice did you actually follow? How many books met the strong
  promise you felt when you first read the title?</li>
  <li><b>Don't mistake analysis for learning</b>.<br />
  Assignments over the years ask us to &#147;analyze the content
  and then write a paper&#148;. Yet, Eastern philosophies that
  have existed thousands of years before ours, remind us of the
  role of intuition, and of the role of reflection on our experiences
  (on our practices). Use more than your brain, use your intuition
  and your heart.</li>
  <li><b>Don't mistake education to occur only in classrooms</b>.<br />
  Yet research indicates that adults learn best when they apply
  information to meet current, real needs in their lives, that
  is, when they ground their theories in practice. And they learn
  best when exchanging ongoing feedback around these practices.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="anchor692388"></a></p>

<h2>General Suggestions to Build More Learning into the Plan</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>For every learning method, answer &#147;How will this
  learning effect the real world?&#148;</b>.<br />
  Have your supervisor or best friend hold you accountable to answer
  that question. It may be the most important question in your
  plan and its answer may leave you feeling the most fulfilled
  when the plan has been implemented.</li>
  <li><b>Include learning activities that go well beyond the safety
  of reading and writing papers</b>.<br />
  Take some risks. Have your spouse or close friends suggest what
  you most need to learn and how. Ultimately, ensure that you&#146;re
  not engaged in extended arguments about &#147;How many angels
  will fit on the head of a pin -- come the New Millennium?&#148;.</li>
  <li><b>Take advantage of real-life learning opportunities in
  the workplace</b>.<br />
  Your life and job afford you numerous opportunities from which
  to learn. For example, if you're designing a plan to develop
  leadership skills, then select learning methods that involve
  leading efforts in your community. Volunteer to a local nonprofit
  or professional organization.</li>
  <li><b>Practice principles of unconventional educators, such
  as Paulo Freire and Myles Horton&lt;</b>.<br />
  Freire and Horton taught people to read, not just for the sake
  of learning, but to meet real and current needs in the lives
  of their learners. Horton, who didn&#146;t write any scholarly
  papers in his life, started the Highlander Folk School. The school
  had no classrooms, no expert lecturers. Yet, Martin Luther King
  said that Highlander probably had more to do with addressing
  desegregation than he did. In another case, after leaving Highlander,
  a young black learner refused to go to the back of the bus --
  Rosa Parks.</li>

<h2>General Considerations to Build More Learning into Our Lives</h2>

<p>Many of us give far more attention to the learning we glean
from our classrooms than we do from the rest of our lives. Many
of us come to realize this situation only after we&#146;ve graduated.
Again, some suggestions:<br />
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Write Down Ten Most Important Things You've Learned --
  How Did You Learn Them?</b>.<br />
  It&#146;s ironic that, considering the thousands of exercises
  we&#146;ve been assigned in our lives, this exercise is never
  among them! Yet it&#146;s probably one of the most important.
  Next to each thing you learned, note what you did to learn it.
  Do you know? Did it occur in a classroom? What theory spawned
  that learning?</li>
  <li><b>Once a Week, Write Down a Key Learning Experience -- What
  Did You Learn?</b>.<br />
  You will learn far more from your real-world experiences (or
  practices), including from your intimate relationships with others,
  than you will from all of the classrooms and all of the books
  in the world! (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/journaling.htm">One
  Simple Private Learning Journal</a>.)</li>
  <li><b>Involve Yourself in Community Service -- Great &quot;Classroom&quot;
  in Life!</b>.<br />
  These services are powerful &#147;practices&#148; that soon spawn
  rich, deep learning in our lives!
  <li><b>For One Minute, Stare At Yourself in the Mirror: Ask &quot;How
  Do I Feel About Myself?&quot;</b>.<br />
  Update your training and development plan to address any concerns
  you have about the person staring back at you in the mirror.
  As with any successful therapy or managing or teaching, you must
  first start with yourself.</li>
