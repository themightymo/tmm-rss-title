<h2>Accelerated Learning</h2>

<p>Accelerated learning can include a wide variety of methods
to accelerate the learning of learners, for example, close match
to the learners' learning styles, multi-media communications and
tools, multiple intelligence methods, language-sensitive communications,
acting and role playing, and reflection and inquiry. The success
of accelerated learning depends on how well the methods are integrated
and aligned to match the nature of the learners and to accomplish
the overall goals of the learning program.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Learning</h2>

<p>The hallmark of adaptive learning is its priority on matching
the nature of the methods of learning to the nature of the individual
learner, particularly by using computer-based methods and tools.</p>

<h2>Blended Learning</h2>

<p>Blended learning is what the phrase implies -- a mixture of
different types of training and learning methods, particularly
that are personal, interpersonal and computer-based. As with other
types of learning, success rests on how well the different types
and methods are integrated to match the nature of the learner
and to accomplish the goals of the learning program.</p>

<h2>Inquiry and Reflection</h2>
<p>Numerous driving forces have caused changes in forms of learning and development. 
  Forces include rapid changes that we must keep up with in our environments, 
  increasingly diverse values and perspectives that we must constantly recognize 
  and consider, and increasing competition for resources which results in even 
  less time and resources to attend traditional and often expensive forms of schooling. 
  As a result, there's more interest in learning &quot;on the fly&quot; -- in 
  learning how to learn from our experiences. Learning how to learn requires continuous 
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/types-of-learning.htm#anchor8461">inquiry 
  and reflection</a> about our experiences and the feedback shared with others.</p>

<h2>Loops of Learning</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful breakthroughs in learning and development is understanding 
  &quot;loops&quot; of learning. (These breakthroughs are applied especially in 
  systems thinking and systems tools.) Single-loop learning is doing something 
  in response to rules that are taken for granted. For example, if someone does 
  not adhere to a policy, then that person's actions must be adjusted to be in 
  accordance with the policy. In double-loop learning, the rules themselves are 
  questioned. For example, it might be that person's actions don't need to be 
  changed, but that the policies need to be changed. </p>

<h2>Social Learning and Networked Learning</h2>
<p>Social learning recognizes the learning that comes from interaction and feedback 
  with others, especially via various means of telecommunications. Social learning 
  looks very much at the nature of communications over various media. Networked 
  learning is related in that it also examines the various patterns of communications. 
  Both concepts focus on the learning that comes from these examinations, and 
  how that learning can be enhanced in life and work. </p>

<h2>Organizational and Group Learning</h2>
<p>Organizational learning is a movement (some would argue that it is a theory 
  with various associated models) to help organizations identify new knowledge, 
  skills and attitudes in the structures and systems of the organizations, especially 
  to enhance performance of the organizations and its members. (See the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/organizational-learning.htm">Learning 
  Organization</a>.) Work is typically done in teams in organizations. Thus, it's 
  very important that organizations find ways to enhance learning in groups, much 
  the same way that organizations (which many view as very large groups) enhance 
  learning in the overall organization. </p>

<h2>Virtual Learning (Distance Learning)
(Online Learning)</h2>

<p>Virtual learning is learning that is accomplished primarily via computer-based 
  methods and tools, particularly those via the Internet and Web. The costs of 
  developing and implementing training and development programs are reduced significantly 
  when computer-based activities and materials are suitable to those programs.
