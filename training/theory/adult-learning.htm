<h2>Some Contemporary Principles of Adult Learning -- Principles Too Often Forgotten</h2>

<p>The process of action learning, founded by Reginald Revans
about 50 years ago in England, is based on contemporary views
of adult learning. Action learning asserts that adults learn best
when:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Working to address a current, real-world problem</li>
  <li>They are highly vest in solving the current problem</li>
  <li>They actually apply new materials and information and</li>
  <li>Exchange ongoing feedback around their experiences</li>
</ol>

<p>These principles are further substantiated by the work of Peter Senge as described 
  in his book <em>Fifth Discipline </em>(Doubleday, 1990). Although the principles 
  seem obvious, think of how very little they are utilized in contemporary, traditional 
  forms of education where people are expected to sit in a classroom and hear 
  from an expert on the subject matter. After those classes, learners rarely see 
  each other, much less to even share ongoing feedback around applying the new 
  learning. </p>
<h2><a name="myths" id="myths"></a>Understand Common Myths About Training and 
  Development</h2>
<p>As you read the following list of major problems, think about your own experiences 
  with training and development.</p>
<h3>Myth #1: One-shot, &quot;quick-fix&quot; training sessions are usually enough.</h3>
<p>How often do we hear of organizations that implement development programs in 
  which participants only have to attend training sessions -- no accountability 
  for implementation and learning required! If people are truly serious about 
  developing skills, they need to put in more practice and effort than that.</p>
<h3>Myth #2: Learners almost always apply materials from training sessions.</h3>
<p>It's often difficult -- and rare indeed -- for learners to later transfer learning 
  from training sessions (courses, seminars and workshops) over to their lives 
  and work. Training methods rarely incorporate real-life, current challenges 
  in the lives of learners. Therefore, learners are left on their own to later 
  apply new concepts from the many books and binders gained during the training 
  sessions.</p>
<h3>Myth #3: People can achieve major goals from taking one-shot training sessions.</h3>
<p>Few major challenges in life or work are addressed by some specific procedure 
  conveyed during a training session. Rather, learners get stuck because of strong misperceptions, feelings or structural problems. Getting unstuck requires ongoing 
  support, reflection and testing of new methods on current, real-life challenges. 
  This ongoing support, reflection and testing in real-life are seldom included 
  in traditional training sessions.</p>
<h3>Myth #4: Trainers don't need to plan for ongoing support among learners.</h3>
<p>Few training programs recognize that learners very often need ongoing support 
  to take the risks necessary to apply new information and materials from training 
  sessions. At the end of a course, seminar or workshop, learners are left on 
  their own.</p>
<h3>Myth #5: Learners are not cynical about training and development.</h3>
<p>Trainers and practitioners continue to ignore this major issue. To deal with 
  cynicism, people must have a forum in which to vent, to be authentic. Training 
  programs rarely afford that forum.</p>
<h3>Myth #6: Training is not really expensive.</h3>
<p>The price of education, including training and development, is skyrocketing, 
  while creating a social crisis that leaves many businesses and their employees 
  unable to access traditional means to education, training and development.</p>
