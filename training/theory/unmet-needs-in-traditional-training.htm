<h2>About this Document</h2>

<p>This document is Chapter Two from the booklet &quot;Leaders
Circles: Self-Managed Teams of Self-Directed Learners&quot; by
Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD. The chapter is a research-oriented
overview of the problems often encountered when using traditional
classroom training in hopes of enhancing management skills (including
leadership and supervisoral skills), solving complex problems
and/or resolving organizational problems.</p>

<p>Traditional classroom techniques are highly useful for communicating
various theories and models to a large body of students to &quot;socialize&quot;
them into a field. Traditional training techniques are also useful
to convey procedures for conducting highly focused and rather
specific activities. Recommendations herein are intended to direct
development programs to be more relevant and developmental for
today's highly diverse and busy leaders. As leaders must change
to accommodate the changing nature of organizations, trainers
and developers must change to accommodate the changing nature
of leadership.</p>

<p><a name="anchor251646"></a></p>

<h2>More Learner-Driven Programs: Accommodate Learners' Expressed
Needs</h2>

<p>Educators intend their courses to be as relevant as possible
to their students, or learners. However, to meet the expanding
and diverse needs of students, educators often fall victim to
instilling more quantity then quality in their courses. The primary
goal of educators then becomes to expose the students to as much
of this &quot;learning&quot; as possible. Meeting this goal requires
educators to conduct a fast-paced and intensive delivery of course
information. Students are left to quickly record the information,
store it away, somehow realize which information is needed in
a current work situation, and know where the information can be
accessed. Students rarely accomplish this feat.</p>

<p>Leaders needing information to meet a current challenge in
their workplaces often must wait several months until a related
course is scheduled to be held. Often, fees for training programs
are set high so as to be based on &quot;executive-level pricing&quot;
-- to many developers and learners, the concept that high fees
somehow imply high value. Rarely are participants configured to
remain together in their own networks as they support each other
to <i>apply</i> their new book knowledge.</p>

<p>An increasing number of developers realize that the above approaches
must be changed. They realize that longer-lasting forms of learning
occur around participants' current and real-world issues. They
realize the need for adaptable development programs that can be
integrated with other forms of learning to accommodate the needs
of highly diverse and busy learners. Developers cannot improve
their methods on their own. The most important contributions from
learners is for them to speak up about their needs and frustrations
regarding training and development programs.</p>

<p><a name="anchor265108"></a></p>

<h2>More Focus on Self-Management: Management Development Starts
with People</h2>

<p>If individuals are to effectively lead their organizations,
they must first effectively lead themselves. Revans (1983, p.
55) explains, &quot;Those unable to change themselves cannot change
what goes on around them. ... Without power to discard beliefs
shown to be wrong, one cannot introduce actions known to be right.&quot;
More development programs must follow this principle. Smith (1993,
p 44) adds, &quot;A consistent feature of the better researched
competency models is the inclusion of the need for self-knowledge,
self-understanding and self-management. ... I have found that
ultimate success increases in proportion to the attention given
to this by participants and faculty.&quot; Senge et. al., (1994)
explains the importance of each leader's understanding their own
&quot;mental models&quot; about the world, that is, their sets
of assumptions which leads them to perceive the world as they
do. Senge asserts that working with mental models &quot;offers
the highest leverage for change&quot; (p. 239).</p>

<p>It is often extremely stressful to lead in today's rapidly
changing society, organizations, and marketplaces. Leaders require
strong senses of balance, humility, and confidence to retain clear
perspectives and exercise continuing courage in their decisions.
The most basic requirement is that they remain authentic in their
dealings with themselves and others. This, in turn, requires ongoing
support, affirmation, and understanding so they can cultivate
the courage to lead authentically.</p>

<p>Leaders require more development programs that dedicate time
specifically for each leader to express and work on their own
needs. Development must start where each leader is at now, to
address current needs around which leaders can learn. To learn
about themselves and from their own experiences, leaders require
continuous feedback from other experienced leaders. Leaders must
participate in their development in an authentic fashion. Self-development
programs will not be effective if leaders don't take responsibility
for their own development, which excludes passive dependency on
outside &quot;experts&quot; for quick-fix answers. The courage
for this authenticity requires a safe environment and support
from others.</p>

<h2>Address Increasing Cynicism: Get Past Quick Fixes to Realistic
Expectations</h2>

<h3>Cynicism on the Rise</h3>

<p>Research indicates that cynicism is on the rise in American
business and industry, which increasingly hurts their competitiveness
and ability to accommodate today's needed organizational changes.
Mirvis and Kanter (1989) found in their national survey that 43%
of workers are cynical and 40% of managers and supervisors are
cynical, as well. In their later study (1991) they concluded that
cynicism among workers is increasing.</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1989) are careful throughout their work
to remind us that cynicism is different from skepticism which
is healthy response to work and life. Skeptics are open to change.
Cynics aren't.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, Goldner, Ritti, and Ference (1977) suggested
that as organizations become more complex, members become often
more cynical. This does not bode well, considering that our organizations
are indeed becoming more complex as they struggle to respond to
increased competition, public expectations, dynamic technologies,
and diverse work forces.</p>

<h3>Effects of Cynicism</h3>

<p>Jaffe and Scott (1993) explain that cynical managers can undermine
large-scale organizational transformation through impatience,
emotional illiteracy, elitism, insecurity, poor modeling, anger,
and alienation. The authors note an unfortunate, yet common, by-product
of many of today's training sessions: &quot;a 'workshop high'
intended to produce momentary resolve to change [but!] then bitter
disappointment and cynicism&quot; (pp. 141-142).</p>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1989, p. 383) explain that the recipe for
cynicism is simple: &quot;hype up people's hopes, disappoint them,
and then take advantage of them until they become disillusioned.&quot;
In their latter study (1991) they restate this recipe by explaining
three key ingredients to cynicism: 1) unrealistically high expectations
of oneself and others, 2) the experience of disappointment in
oneself and others [and the resulting feelings of frustration
and defeat!], and 3) disillusionment from and being deceived by
others. Systems theorist, Peter Senge (1990, p. 146), notes, <br />
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Scratch the surface of most cynics and you find a frustrated
  idealist -- someone who made the mistake of converting his ideals
  into expectations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Addressing Cynicism</h3>

<p>Mirvis and Kanter (1991) believe that organizations must address
this increasing cynicism by managing more fairly, and operating
in an open, honest, straightforward, and particularly, realistic
manner (that is, an authentic manner). Employees must be able
to participate in governance, provide regular reality checks to
management, have positive role models, and perceive an open and
honest pay system. Sanford and Mang (1993, p. 157) note, <br />
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;It takes equal effort on the part of operators to overcome
  patterns, one of the most common being the fear and/or cynicism
  that this is just another `program of the month'.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Development programs can address rising cynicism by avoiding
promise of quick-fix strategies, truly listening to the needs
of leaders, and providing strategies for leaders to test their
expectations in their workplaces. One of the most effective approaches
to testing expectations is by discussing them with other experienced
leaders and &quot;piloting&quot; them in their places of work.</p>

<p>At a minimum, programs must provide safe environments where
cynics can express their views and frustrations. Unless learners
can reach a point where they're participating in an authentic
fashion (even if only by cynical rantings), developers and learners
may be wasting their time and even making things worse.</p>

<p><a name="anchor289090"></a></p>

<h2>Address Increasing Burnout: Information Alone Rarely Helps</h2>

<p>Uncertainty, ambiguity, change, and paradox dominate management
literature. Rosen (in Hendrick, 1993, p. E1:2), President of the
American Institute of Stress, indicates that recent, dizzying
changes in technology and the economy are causing unprecedented
burnout, cynicism, sickness, and absenteeism.</p>

<p>Burnout and its associated symptoms of chronic anxiety, tension,
and depression are destructive to leaders' quality of life and
performance. Their low morale and productivity impair organizational
effectiveness. In this state, leaders cannot readily comprehend
and apply the seemingly complex nature of concepts and models
suggested in today's management literature.</p>

<p>The most effective strategy for dealing with stress is to remove
the stressor; usually this is not possible (Weick, 1979). The
second most effective strategy is personal resiliency. This strategy,
in turn, depends on a strong sense of self and consistent sources
of renewal. Burned out learners cannot readily apply written or
stated suggestions for renewal. The best strategies for renewal
include individual attention, highly accessible forums for expression,
and ongoing support from others.</p>

<p>In addition, those who are burned out often have unrealistic
expectations of what they can do. Feedback from experienced leaders
can temper expectations, resulting in more realistic and reasonable
work loads.</p>

<p><a name="anchor268691"></a></p>

<h2>Help Leaders Help Each Other: Produces Exponential Increase
in Development &quot;Programs&quot;</h2>

<p>Market research conducted by MAP for Nonprofits indicated that
leaders felt isolated and hungry for information from experienced
peers, but unable to sustain methods for ongoing interactions.
The results of MAP's research concur with that of Balog (1994)
and Revans (1983).</p>

<p>Strategic alliances and collaboration are usually encouraged
because of increased access to needed resources and potential
cost savings from economies of scale; rarely are these strategies
suggested to help leaders help each other with ongoing support,
problem solving, and learning.</p>

<p>When leaders do establish relationships with other leaders,
these relationships rarely afford the extent of trust and confidentiality
required to provide ongoing support. When leaders encounter major
challenges in their workplaces, they typically look to designated
&quot;experts&quot; for advice -- they rarely look to each other.
This phenomena is rather ironic considering the high regard in
which leaders seem to hold each other, particularly in regard
to the strong credibility they have in each other's feedback.</p>

<p>Networks provide leaders a reliable means for social interaction
which, in turn, enhance leaders' learning. Senge (1990) explains
that one of the biggest myths in development is that people learn
from experience. He clarifies that they don't learn from experiences
alone -- they require ongoing feedback. Networking provides leaders
an effective means for that ongoing feedback. Paulo Freire (in
Bell, Gaventa, and Peters, 1990) points out that authentic thinking
-- thinking that is concerned with reality -- does not take place
in ivory tower isolation, but in communication with others. We
develop our own sense of meaning from ongoing communication of
perceptions and ideas with others.</p>

<p>Effective networking and development programs must include
time focused on each participant so they can discuss their own
complex needs and receive targeted assistance and resources. Effective
listening and feedback cultivate supportive affirmation and validation.
At a minimum, development programs must cultivate safe environments
in which leaders can share their needs and help each other to
meet their ongoing needs.</p>

<p>If the means for accessible and self-managing networks were
established among leaders to help them solve real-world problems,
there exists the means for an exponential increase in leadership
effectiveness. This is very likely the most strategic service
developers could provide leaders, their organizations, and their
communities.</p>

<p><a name="anchor270431"></a></p>

<h2>Convey Practical and Relevant Information: More Quality with
Quantity</h2>

<p>As noted by Eccles and Nohria (1992, p. 1), &quot;In recent
years, there has been an amazing amount of verbiage instructing
managers on how to become `leading-edge,' `excellent,' or `innovative'
-- yet little of it attends to the practical questions of how
to actually get things done in the organizations.&quot; Many new
models are proposed as if to be quick, permanent fixes to today's
major problems in the workplace (Kilmann, 1989). Deutsch (1991)
asserts that training has traditionally been separate from the
day-to-day realities of managing an organization. Morris (1991,
p. 76) notes, &quot;Of all the manifold needs that the different
forms of learning must meet, surely the greatest is the need for
leadership, rather than the need for acquiring stocks of established
knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a role for &quot;advanced&quot; theories and models.
Related discussion is useful to the extent that learners understand
and appreciate benefits of research, spawn enlightening analyses
and exploration, and infer eventual application of these theories
and models. Both developers and learners must continue to realize
that effective learning results from experience and feedback;
this, in turn, requires developers to convey information that
is ultimately practical and relevant in nature.</p>

<p>Ensuring information to be practical and relevant requires
continued testing of information in the day-to-day realities of
leading an organization, continuous feedback from those who apply
the information, and ongoing authentic participation from dedicated
developers and learners.</p>

<p><a name="anchor272065"></a></p>

<h2>Incorporate Relevant Learning Activities: Without Practice,
There's No Knowledge</h2>

<p>Henderson (1993, p. 18) notes that &quot;Managerial competencies
cannot be delivered effectively by teaching alone&quot; (p. 21).
Mangham (1990, p. 115) adds, &quot;... to learn, managers must
be given the opportunity to perform, to be involved with and responsible
for the solution to a business problem.&quot; Revans (1983, p.
64) states the issue eloquently: &quot;If new perceptions are
not soon checked against the real world they purport to reflect
-- and, preferably, by some test that challenges the responsibility
of the manager undertaking to conduct it -- none can be sure the
discussions have not so much modified perception in the direction
of truthfulness as they may have merely swapped one misunderstanding
for another.&quot; Paulo Freire (in Bell, Gaventa, and Peters,
1990, p. 98) summarizes this strong principle of learning: &quot;Without
practice, there's no knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>It is tempting to design curricula to be based only on simulated
learning activities, such as case studies. However, it's often
difficult for students to generate learning from these simulations
and readily apply that learning back in their workplaces. Materials
and resources provided for learning must be strategies for meaningful
learning, and not provided as ends in themselves. Extended analyses
and discussions of abstract concepts and theories are, at times,
fascinating. However, the value of these types of activities should
be based, not on their value for novelty and entertainment, but
on relevance and practicality.</p>

<p>Developers must incorporate learning strategies that require
ongoing actions from learners. These ongoing actions cultivate
courage, provoke experiences around which deep learning occurs,
and grounds learning in the day-to-day realities of leading an
organization. Ongoing actions also constitute a &quot;reality
check&quot; to highly novel concepts and ideas.</p>

<p><a name="anchor273660"></a></p>

<h2>Develop Skills in Reflection (to Value and Learn from One's
Own Experiences)</h2>

<p>Writers (Marsick, 1987; McGill and Beaty, 1995; Pedler, 1991)
allege that today's management development methods must change
to effectively equip managers with the skills required to lead
in today's rapidly changing world. Morris (1991, p.76) warns,
&quot;In our rapidly changing and confused age of unreason, which
often places far more emphasis on hasty and unconsidered action
than reflective learning, we are in grave danger of confusing
leadership with expertise.&quot; McGill and Beaty (1995) explain
that trainers must adapt their methods to accommodate the increasing
need for student-centered learning, transferable skills, and closer
links with industry. The authors explain, &quot;In times of crisis
or radical change, reflection becomes more important and also
more difficult; it is at these times that we make powerful decisions
about the future&quot; (p. 21).</p>

<p>Schon (1983) emphasizes the need for today's leaders and managers
to be more reflective in order to learn from their experiences,
especially in today's increasing rate of change. Beckhard and
Pritchard (1992, p. 9) note, &quot;Probably the most important
single process involved in effective change in the process of
<i>learning while doing</i> [italics is theirs!].&quot; McCaffrey
(1994) found that while most students see themselves as reflective
thinkers, traditional development methods provide few opportunities
to think reflectively.</p>

<p>The extent to which developers and learners can cultivate effective
inquiry and feedback is the extent to which they develop skills
in reflection. (Note that, although the &quot;Socratic Method&quot;
is based primarily on continued questioning as a form of inquiry,
often the method is intended to manipulate learners to the &quot;correct&quot;
answer as determined by the questioner.)<br />
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The greatest barrier to change is not a lack of knowledge.
  We all know more than we know. It is our understanding that is
  the problem, not our ignorance&quot; (Casey, 1991, p. 235).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="anchor275193"></a></p>

<h2>Address Paralysis from Analysis: &quot;What's the Meaning
of it All?&quot;</h2>

<p>Terry (1993) describes our increasing preoccupation with the
need for authenticity. He mentions that many of us experience
a (p. 114) &quot;deep, yet undefined, sense of disconnection,&quot;
&quot;worry about the viability of new structures, and &quot;a
fragility of shared purposes.&quot; Existential psychologist,
Rollo May (1958, p. 13), explains that members of our society
are going through a period of tremendous upheaval, causing symptoms
of &quot;unhappiness, inability to decide, general despair and
meaninglessness ...&quot;</p>

<p>The recent increase in literature about finding soul in business
reflects this crisis in authenticity (Chappell, 1995; Heider,
1986; Koestenbaum, 1991; Moore, 1995; Pollard, 1996; Whyte, 1994;).
Among reasons they cite for our discomfort are disintegrating
values in our society, tremendous changes as a result of globalization
and telecommunications, and continued threat to our moral values
from strong pursuit of growing profits. Ray and Rinzler (1993)
explain how this upheaval is associated with a &quot;new paradigm
in business.&quot; Pauchant (1993, 1995) and Wheatley (1992) add
that this overall situation in business leaves many of us searching
for meaning. Overall, these writers describe the confusion, alienation,
and loss of soul and meaning as experienced by many of us today,
and recommend various and different strategies for restoring our
senses of soul and meaning.</p>

<p>But these warnings of impending doom and the barrage of suggested
strategies for &quot;recovery&quot; (many of which seem quite
difficult to convert to the day-to-day realities of leading in
organizations) leave many leaders convinced that they just can't
lead effectively. They hear that they must improve dramatically
and soon. Yet they feel that, try as they might, they just aren't
competent enough to &quot;correctly&quot; apply the &quot;expert&quot;
strategies.</p>

<p>Given the stresses inherent in any leadership role and this
nearly impossible situation, they work even harder to find meaning
from yet more writers, gurus, and consultants. Many of these leaders
become disillusioned with themselves and their outside &quot;experts.&quot;
They become neurotic, confused, and cynical. Smith (in Pauchant,
1995, p. 181) best explains the typical trap into which many of
us fall: &quot;... we are so determined not to become what we
fear is possible, that every day we fail to be anything of substance.
And it is this failure to be anything of substance that we are
so desperate to avoid. So we have already become in the present
what we most fear we could become in the future. However, while
we work so hard not to become that in the future, we fail to recognize
we are already in that condition in the present.&quot;</p>

<p>Central to the beliefs of existential philosophers and therapists,
such as Frankl (1984), Pauchant (1993, 1995), and Yalom (1980),
is that there are certain anxieties and responsibilities inherent
in life and that these cannot be avoided. If we attempt to delegate
them to outside &quot;experts&quot; or rid them through quick
fixes, then we fall into chronic anxiety, boredom, and despair.
Ultimately, we lose meaning. Meaning cannot be supplied to us;
we each must take responsibility for developing our own meaning
in our lives. Meaning comes from our living authentically, including
from taking full responsibility for ourselves, participating fully
in the here-and-now, and applying the courage and actions to change
the things we realistically can change.</p>

<p>Readers might recognize that the existential perspective described
in the above paragraph is very similar to systems' theorist Peter
Senge's &quot;Shifting the Burden&quot; archetype that he describes
in his book, <i>The Fifth Discipline</i> (Currency Doubleday,
1990). Senge explains, &quot;An underlying problem (in a system)
generates symptoms that demand attention. But the underlying problem
is difficult for people to address, either because it is obscure
or costly to confront. So people 'shift the burden' of their problem
to other solutions -- well intentioned, easy fixes which seem
extremely efficient. Unfortunately, the easier 'solutions' only
ameliorate the symptoms; they leave the underlying problem unaltered.
The underlying problem grows worse, unnoticed because symptoms
apparently clear up, and the system loses abilities it had to
solve the underlying problem&quot; (p. 104).</p>
