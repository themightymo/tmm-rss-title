<h2>Description</h2>

<p>One of the most critical skills to learn in life is the ability
to learn from life. If you're like most of us, when you think
of learning, you think of classrooms. This is probably true because
you had learning in mind when you signed up for the classes, sat
through their lectures and took their tests. Yet the most important
things that you've learned in your life probably were not learned
in a classroom. If you can go through life with learning in mind
(as you did in your classes), then you can greatly expand your
capacity for learning and living. This is the basic premise of
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">continuous
learning</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful and highly accessible methods to learn
how to learn is ongoing journaling. Many people seek journaling
as means to learn more about themselves. They start journaling,
but soon stop. Ironically, their journaling might have already
taught them something very important about themselves: they want
to learn, but they don't want to work to learn it! As with most
important forms of learning, journaling takes some effort -- if
only to write down for the day &quot;I don't want to write anything
today!&quot;</p>

<h2>One Simple Format for A Private, Learning Journal</h2>

<p><b>Learning</b> is often interpreted as enhancing your knowledge,
understanding or perceptions or attitudes, or behaviors or skills.</p>

<p>1. What learning have you accomplished (or are you accomplishing)
lately?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>a) What experience spawned that learning?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>b) What learning did you accomplish from that experience?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>c) How can you carry this learning forward to improve your
life? Your work?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>2. What learning might you accomplish in the near future?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>a) What experience might spawn that learning?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>b) What learning might you accomplish from that experience?</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>c) How might you carry this learning forward to improve your
life? Your work?</p>
