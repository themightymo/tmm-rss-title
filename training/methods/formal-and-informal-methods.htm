<h2><a name="two" id="two"></a>Two Dimensions of Training and Development Processes</h2>

<p>You could describe training and development processes using
two dimensions - one for the degree of formality and one for the
balance between self-directed and other-directed learning.</p>

<p>These two sets of choices result in four overall approaches.
That is, one can take an informal approach to self-directed or
&quot;other-directed&quot; learning. Similarly, one can take a
formal approach to self-directed or &quot;other-directed&quot;
learning.</p>

<h2><a name="factors" id="factors"></a>Decision Factors on Those Dimensions</h2>

<p>The decision about what approach to take to training depends
on several factors. These factors include the amount of funding
available for training, specificity and complexity of the knowledge
and skills needed, timeliness of training needed, and capacity
and motivation of the learner.</p>

<p>Other-directed, formal training is typically more expensive
than other approaches, but is often the most reliable to use for
the learner to achieve the desired knowledge and skills in a timely
fashion. Self-directed, informal learning can be very low-cost,
however the learner should have the capability and motivation
to pursue their own training. Training may take longer than other-directed
forms.</p>

<p>Highly specific and routine tasks can often be trained without
complete, formal approaches. On the other hand, highly complex
and changing roles often require more complete and formal means
of development, which can be very expensive as a result.</p>

<p>If training is needed right away, then other-directed training
is often very useful, e.g., to sign up for a training course at
a local university, college or training center. Or, a training
professional can be brought in. Again, other-directed training
is usually faster and more reliable, but more expensive.</p>

<p>Self-directed forms of training require that the learner be
highly motivated and able to conceptualize their approach to training,
particularly in formal training.</p>

<h2><a name="informalformal" id="informalformal"></a>Informal and Formal Training 
  and Development</h2>

<h3>Informal Training and Development</h3>

<p>Informal learning is very likely the most common form of learning. There is 
  no formal structure or curriculum, and usually no expert trainer who teaches 
  students. There usually is no formal recognition of completion, for example, 
  a certificate or diploma. Informal learning is ideal for very experienced people. 
  Formal learning is ideal for new learners, for example, to learn a new technology 
  or specific procedure.</p>
<p>Informal training and development is rather casual and incidental. Typically, 
  there are no specified training goals as such, nor are their ways to evaluate 
  if the training actually accomplished these goals or not. This type of training 
  and development occurs so naturally that many people probably aren't aware that 
  they're in a training experience at all. Probably the most prominent form of 
  informal training is learning from experience on the job. Examples are informal 
  discussions among employees about a certain topic, book discussion groups, and 
  reading newspaper and journal articles about a topic. A more recent approach 
  is sending employees to hear prominent speakers, sometimes affectionately called 
  &quot;the parade of stars&quot;.</p>

<p>Informal training is less effective than formal training if one should intentionally 
  be learning a specific area of knowledge or skill in a timely fashion. Hardly 
  any thought is put into what learning is to occur and whether that learning 
  occurred or not. (However, this form of training often provides the deepest 
  and richest learning because this form is what occurs naturally in life.)</p>

<h3>Formal Training and Development</h3>

<p>Formal training is based on some standard &quot;form&quot;.
Formal training might include:<br />
a) declaring certain learning objectives (or an extent of knowledge,
skills or abilities that will be reached by learners at the end
of the training), <br />
b) using a variety of learning methods to reach the objectives
and then <br />
b) applying some kind(s) of evaluation activities at the end of
the training.</p>

<p>The methods and means of evaluation might closely associate
with the learning objectives, or might not. For example, courses,
seminars and workshops often have a form -- but it's arguable
whether or not their training methods and evaluation methods actually
assess whether the objectives have been met or not.</p>

<h3>Formal, Systematic Training and Development</h3>

<p>Systematic, formal training involves carefully proceeding through
the following phases:<br />
a) Assessing what knowledge, skills and /or abilities are needed
by learners;<br />
b) Designing the training, including identifying learning goals
and associated objectives, training methods to reach the objectives,
and means to carefully evaluate whether the objectives have been
reached or not;<br />
c) Developing the training methods and materials;<br />
d) Implementing the training; and<br />
e) Evaluating whether objectives have been reached or not, in
addition to the quality of the training methods and materials
themselves</p>

<p>A systematic approach is goal-oriented (hopefully, to produce results for the 
  organization and/or learners), with the results of each phase being used by 
  the next phase. Typically, each phase provides ongoing evaluation feedback to 
  other phases in order to improve the overall system's process.</p>

<p>Note, again, that not all formal methods are systematic. Some courses, workshops, 
  and other training sessions have goals, methods and evaluation, but they are 
  not aligned, or even integrated. The methods, in total, do not guide the learner 
  toward achieving the training goal. The evaluations are too often of how a learner 
  feels about the learning experience, rather than of how well the learning experience 
  achieved the goal of the training.</p>

<h2><a name="directed" id="directed"></a>Self-Directed and &quot;Other-Directed&quot; 
  Learning </h2>

<h3>Self-Directed Learning</h3>

<p>Self-directed training includes the learner making the decisions about what 
  training and development experiences will occur and how. The learner selects 
  and carries out their own learning goals, objectives, methods and means to verifying 
  that the goals were met. Self-directed training seems to be more popular of 
  late. Note that one can pursue a self-directed approach to informal or formal 
  training. For example, self-directed, informal training might include examples 
  of informal training listed above (book discussion groups, etc.), as long as 
  the learner chose the activities and topics themselves, either for professional 
  or personal reasons. Self-directed, formal training includes the learner's selecting 
  and carrying out their own learning goals, objectives, methods and means to 
  verifying that the goals were met. (For additional information about self-directed 
  learning, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">The 
  Strong Value of Self-Directed Learning in the Workplace</a>.)</p>
<p>Probably the most important skill for today's rapidly changing workforce is 
  skills in self-reflection. The highly motivated, self-directed learner with 
  skills in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/types-of-learning.htm#anchor8461">self-reflection</a> 
  can approach the workplace as a continual classroom from which to learn. Supervisors 
  and employees who work together to accomplish formal, self-directed learning 
  in the workplace also accomplish <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">continuous 
  learning</a> for continued productivity and learning.</p>
<p>Self-directed learning programs hold numerous advantages over traditional forms 
  of classroom instruction for employees in the workplace, whether they be leaders, 
  managers, or individual contributors. Bouchard (<i>Self-directed Learning in 
  Organizational Settings</i> (working paper), Concordia University, Montreal, 
  Canada) explains, &#147;Over the years, it has become increasingly clear that 
  traditional approaches to program design and delivery in the workplace and in 
  associative organizations present some important weaknesses. Problem areas include: 
  coping with the short life span of useful knowledge; passing down acquired competencies 
  to succeeding cohorts; accommodating the demands of productivity while providing 
  for a continuity of learning; [and!] enabling learners to pursue activities 
  that correspond to their learning styles and needs&#148; (p. 1).</p>
<p>After many years of reflection about learning, eminent psychologist, Carl Rogers, 
  founder of self-directed therapy, asserted that &#147;anything that can be taught 
  to another is relatively inconsequential, and has little or no significant influence 
  on behavior&#148; (<i>On Becoming a Person: A Therapist&#146;s View of Psychotherapy</i>, 
  Houghton Mifflin, 1961, p. 276). He adds, &#147;The only learning which significantly 
  influences behavior is self-discovered, self-appropriated learning&#148; (p. 
  276).</p>
<p>Self-directed learning programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are more effective in development because learning accommodates employees&#146; 
    learning styles and objectives</li>
  <li>Save substantial training costs because learners learn to help themselves 
    and each other with practical and timely materials</li>
  <li>Achieve increased employee effectiveness in their jobs as they learn to 
    learn from their own work experiences and actually apply their learning in 
    their places of work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other-Directed Learning</h3>

<p>This form, of course, is where someone other than the learner
drives what training activities will occur. Other-directed, informal
training includes, e.g., supervisors sending employees to training
about diversity, policies, sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>

<p>Other-directed, formal training includes where someone other
than the learner specifies the training goals will be met in training,
how those goals will be met and how evaluation will occur to verify
that the goals were met. This form of learning is probably the
most recognized because it includes the approach to learning as
used in universities, colleges and training centers. This form
of learning typically grants diplomas and certificates. Note that
this form of training, although readily available in universities,
etc., is usually somewhat &quot;generic&quot;, that is, the program
is geared to accommodate the needs of the most learners and not
be customized to any one learner. Therefore, a learner may pay
tuition fees to learn knowledge and skills that he or she may
not really need.</p>

<p>Another form of &quot;other-directed', formal training is employee
development plans. The plans identify performance goals, how the
goals will be reached, by when and who will verify their accomplishment.</p>

<p>&quot;Other-directed', formal training can be highly effective
for helping learners gain desired areas of knowledge and skills
in a timely fashion. A drawback is that learners can become somewhat
passive, counting on the &quot;expert&quot; to show them what
they should be doing and when.</p>
