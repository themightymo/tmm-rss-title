<p>There are numerous types of activities which learners can conduct
to reach their learning objectives -- arguably the best activity
is life itself. The learner can conduct one type of activity below
or several. The list actually comprises what might be called types,
modes and methods of learning and even some learning aids.</p>

<p>Note that conducting any of the following activities (or types
of activities) will not by themselves necessarily generate learning.
Ideally, the following are selecting during the systematic design
of a training and development experience, whether self-directed
or other-directed.</p>

<h2>Some Typical Ways of Learning</h2>

<p>Training methods are either on-the-job, implemented outside
the organization or a combination of both.The following is a brief
overview of rather typical methods of development (in alphabetical
order):</p>

<h3>Apprenticeships</h3>

<p>For centuries, apprenticeships were the major approach to learning
a craft. The apprentice worked with a recognized master craftsperson.
Particularly during times of low unemployment, businesses are
eager to get any kind of help they can find. Seeking an apprenticeship
may be a very useful and effective way to eventually develop a
new skill.</p>

<h3>Career Counseling</h3>

<p>Hopefully, learners have the opportunity to work with their
supervisors to develop career plans which identify areas for improvement
or advancement, how those areas can be addressed and when.</p>

<h3>Coaching</h3>

<p>Coaching is becoming a very popular means of development, and
often includes working one-on-one with the learner to conduct
a needs assessment, set major goals to accomplish, develop an
action plan, and support the learner to accomplish the plan. The
learner drives these activities and the coach provides continuing
feedback and support. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm">Coaching</a>.</p>

<h3>Continuing Professional Development</h3>

<p>Many professions require verification of ongoing training to
retain certification, e.g., social workers, some fields of law,
nurses, etc. Professionals must stay up-to-date in the views and
practices necessary to lead and manage in today's organizations.
There seems to be an increasing number of universities, colleges
and training centers associating continuing education units (CEU's)
with their courses and workshops.</p>

<h3>Continuous Learning</h3>

<p>Continuous learning is learning how to learn. Typically, this involves developing 
  skills in reflection, which is the ability to continually inquire and think 
  about experience to draw conclusions and insights. It also involves the ability 
  to conceptualize the learning process. Continuous learning is often associated 
  with the concepts of systems thinking and organizational learning. Continuous 
  learning is NOT about continually taking courses -- it's about developing skills 
  in reflection and inquiry -- it's about learning how to learn so that your life 
  and work experiences become your own learning lab. Organizations and other environments 
  are changing rapidly. Therefore, it's extremely important to continually be 
  aware of those changes, and to be reflecting on them and learning from them, 
  as well.</p>

  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/training-and-development/2011/06/06/how-many-steps-to-continuous-learning-none/" target="_blank">How Many Steps to Continuous Learning? None</a></p>

<h3>Courses</h3>

<p>Universities, colleges and training centers often have a large
number of courses in management, professional and personal development.
If the learner is looking to build a skill, then he or she must
actually apply new information from these courses -- otherwise,
the learner is collecting information (hopefully, knowledge),
rather than building skills.</p>

<h3>Distance Learning (eLearning, Virtual Learning)</h3>

<p>Distance learning has become a mainstream approach in training and development. 
  This typically includes learning by getting information and / or guidance from 
  people who are not face-to-face with the learner, e.g., learning via satellite 
  broadcast, broadcast over the Internet, e-mail or postal mail correspondence, 
  etc. Some people consider online learning or elearning (e.g., information, tutorials, 
  etc., available on diskette, CD-ROM, over the Internet, etc.) to be distance 
  learning, as well. </p>

<h3>Internships</h3>

<p>Internships are offered usually by organizations to college
students wanting to find work experience during the summer months.
The internships offer precious, real-life job experience and the
organizations often get skilled, highly dedicated service. Many
times, interns go on to be hired by the organizations, as well.</p>

<h3>Job Assignments</h3>

<p>Job assignments are wonderful opportunities from which to learn.
We just aren't used to thinking of them that way. To cultivate
learning, consider having employees write short reports, including
an overview of what they did, why they did it, what areas of knowledge
and skills were used, how the job might have been done better,
and what areas of knowledge and skills would be needed to improve
the job.</p>

<h3>Job Rotations</h3>

<p>This can be one of the most powerful forms of development,
allowing learners to experience a broad range of managerial settings,
cultures and challenges.</p>

<h3>Lectures</h3>

<p>Lectures, or focused presentations by experts on subject matter,
are held in a wide variety of locations, not just in classrooms.
Professional associations often bring in speakers. Guest lectures
are often sponsored by local universities, colleges and training
centers, and announced to the public. Many times, the lectures
are repeated over local radio and television.</p>

<h3>Management Development Programs</h3>

<p>Local universities, colleges and training centers usually offer
these programs. Carefully review their program content and design
to ensure that training includes real-life learning activities
during which learners can develop skills for the workplace. See
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/management/development/index.htm">Management
Development</a>.</p>

<h3>Mentoring</h3>

<p>Hopefully, learners find experienced managers in the workplace
who are willing to take learners &quot;under their wing&quot;
and provide ongoing coaching and mentoring. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/mentoring.htm">Mentoring</a>.</p>

<h3>Off-the-Job Training</h3>

<p>Off the job training occurs when an employee works after hours
to learn. See <a class="textlink" href="http://www.suite101.com/content/methods-of-off-the-job-training-a332479" target="_blank">Methods of Off the Job Training: Tips and
Strategy.</a></p>

<h3>Online Training</h3>

<p>There are an increasing number of approaches to online learning.
See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Online
Learning</a>. Sources of online training include learning from
computer diskette, CD-ROM, the Internet or Web-based training,
etc.</p>

<h3>On-the-Job Training</h3>

<p>This form helps particularly to develop the occupational skills necessary to 
  manage an organization, e.g., to fully understand the organization's products 
  and services and how they are developed and carried out. Also see</p>

<h3>Other-Directed Learning</h3>

<p>This includes having someone other than the learner identify
the training goal, methods to achieve the goal, and approaches
to evaluating the training and progress toward achieving the training
goal.</p>

<h3>Orientation to New Jobs or Roles</h3>

<p>A carefully developed procedure for orienting new employees
is very helpful for getting employees &quot;off on the right foot&quot;
when starting their jobs.</p>

<h3>Peer-Based Methods</h3>

<p>This includes formats where peers focus on helping each other
learn, e.g., by exchanging ongoing feedback, questions, supportive
challenges, materials, etc. Perhaps the best example is the action
learning process, originated by Reginald Revans. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/action-learning.htm">Action
Learning</a>.</p>

<h3>Portfolios</h3>

<p>Portfolios are a collection of various results from a learning and development 
  experience, for example, essays, presentations, art work and journals that effectively 
  convey the nature and extent of learning from the experience. See <a class="textlink" href="http://clomedia.com/articles/view/portfolios_a_learning_and_development_tool/" target="_blank">Portfolios 
  -- and Learning and Development Tool</a>.</p>
<h3>Professional Organizations</h3>

<p>A wide variety of professional organizations often offer courses,
seminars, workshops and sessions from conventions.</p>

<h3>Self-Directed Learning</h3>

<p>Highly motivated learners can usually gain a great deal of knowledge and skills 
  by identifying their own learning objectives, how to meet those objectives and 
  how to verify they've met the objectives, as well. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">Strong 
  Value of Self-Directed Learning in the Workplace</a>.</p>

<h3>Storytelling </h3>
<p>Storytelling used to be viewed only as means for entertainment. However, we 
  coming to understand that it also is very powerful means for enlightenment, 
  when listeners are guided to reflect on the stories and to identify themes and 
  patterns that emerge -- and tell us about ourselves, our lives and our work. 
  See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/storytelling.htm">Storytelling 
  in Business</a> </p>
<h3>Television</h3>

<p>Various television networks often have a wide variety of very
enlightening shows about basic job skills, such as computer basics,
business writing, etc.</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>Tutorials includes guidance to proceed through learning some
technique or procedure, e.g., a tutorial on using a computer software
package. There are an increasing number of online tutorials (tutorials
available on diskette, CD-ROM, over the Internet, etc.).</p>

<h3>Training Courses and Workshops</h3>

<p>Workshops, seminars, convention sessions, etc. are useful,
in particular, for highly focused overviews of a particular subject
or training about particular procedures.</p>

<h3>University and College Programs</h3>

<p>It seems there is an exponential number of management development
programs in universities and colleges.</p>

<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p>Workshops typically include some hands-on practice by the learner,
and can be very practical means to learn a certain technique or
procedure.</p>

<h2>Some Tangible Results that Can Be Used to &quot;Document&quot;
Learning</h2>

<p>If you or others are seeking to verify results from your training
and development, it helps to produce tangible items that can be
evaluated to discern if you've achieved your training goals and
objectives. The <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/results-to-evaluate.htm">Sample
Learner's Results</a> comes courtesy of The Union Institute, which
suggests the list to learners when developing their own learning
agreements.</p>
