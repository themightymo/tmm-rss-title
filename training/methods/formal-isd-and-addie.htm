<h2><a name="formal" id="formal"></a>What is Formal and Systematic Training?</h2>
<p>Very simply put, <b>formal training</b> is training that follows some designed 
  form. <b>Informal training</b> does not have an intended, consistent form and 
  usually occurs rather spontaneously and/or casually, for example, reading a 
  book or having an enlightening discussion with a friend. Formal training tends 
  to include preferred results, learning activities intended to achieve the results 
  and some form of evaluation. </p>
<p><b>Systematic, formal training</b> includes careful assessments and attention 
  to determining training goals, designing and building methods and materials 
  that are directly aligned (and often pretested) to achieve the goals, implementing 
  training, and careful evaluation to ensure that training is carried out effectively 
  and that training goals were reached. In systematic, formal training, each phase 
  of the process produces results directly needed by the next phase. </p>
<p>For a more complete comparison of formal to informal training, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">Ways 
  to Look at Training and Development Processes: Informal/Formal and Self-Directed/Other-Directed</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="benefits" id="benefits"></a>Benefits of Formal and Systematic Approaches 
  to Training</h2>
<p>Many of us assume that we already have good training for ourselves and our 
  employees After all, we answer our employees' questions as they have them. We 
  send our employees to a course once in a while. Sure, our approach to training 
  isn't intentional, that is, planned and focused. But our employees seem to be 
  doing their jobs without have any real problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't know what we don't know. It may be that our employees 
  could be performing much better than we realize if they had better skills. It 
  might be that we supervisors could get back a lot of time that otherwise is 
  spent answering our employees' questions. We might retain our employees much 
  longer, as well. Addressing this possibility isn't a &quot;what if&quot; question, 
  it's a primary responsibility of a supervisor.</p>
<p>Adopting a systematic approach to training helps ensure that supervisors are 
  getting the most out of themselves and their employees. A systematic approach 
  to training includes taking the time to analyze what results the organization 
  needs from its employees, if employees are accomplishing those results, and 
  what training and development approaches are needed by employees to better accomplish 
  those results. A systematic approach includes evaluating approaches before, 
  during and after training to ensure employees truly benefited from the training 
  in terms of enhanced results to the organization.</p>
<p>Effective training and development includes using sound principles of performance 
  management and good, basic training techniques.</p>
<h2><a name="isd" id="isd"></a>So What is Instructional Systems Design?</h2>
<p><strong>Instructional Systems Desig</strong>n (ISD) is a type of formal approach 
  to training where the goals of the training are carefully determined often from 
  various types of assessments of the learners, goals are established to address 
  the results of the assessments, various methods of training and learned are 
  developed and designed to achieve those goals, and evaluation plans are established 
  the measure the quality of the training and extent of achievement of the goals.

<h2><a name="addie" id="addie"></a>So What is ADDIE?</h2>
<p>ADDIE is one of the most popular ISD models. ADDIE is an acronym for the phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Analyze</b> the organization's and individual's needs and then identify 
    training goals which, when reached, will equip learner's with the knowledge 
    and skills to meet the organization's and individual's needs. Usually this 
    phase also includes identifying when training should occur and who should 
    attend as learners.</li>
  <li><b>Design</b> a training system that learners and trainers can implement 
    to meet the learning goals. This phase typically includes identifying learning 
    objectives (which culminate in reaching the learning goals), what strategies 
    and activities are needed to achieve the objectives, what resources (money, 
    supplies, facilities, etc.) might be needed, any lessons and the sequence 
    of lessons, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Develop</b> a training &quot;package&quot; of resources and materials, 
    including, e.g., designing webinars, developing audio-visuals, graphics, manuals, 
    etc.</li>
  <li><b>Implement</b> the training package, including to deliver the training 
    by implementing the strategies and conducting the activities, sharing feedback 
    about the program and training methods, administering tests, modifying the 
    design of the trainings and its materials based on feedback from participants, 
    etc. This phase can include administrative activities, such as copying, scheduling 
    facilities, taking attendance data, billing learners, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluate</b> the training, including during and after implementation 
    of training. Evaluation is of the design of the training program, usage of 
    the resources and the results gained by participants in the program.</li>
