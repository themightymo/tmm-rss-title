<p>This topic is about the group-based, Action Learning process in which members 
  work together in a group (a &quot;set&quot;) on real-world priorities (called 
  a &quot;problem&quot; by many practitioners) primarily by sharing questions 
  and taking actions between meetings. Members learn from the reflection during 
  and between meetings, especially regarding the actions they took to address 
  the real-world priorities. The process was founded by Professor Reginald Revans 
  and is now widely used around the world for professional and organizational 
  development. If you need help with Action Learning, consider<a href="http://actionlearningsource.com"><br />

<p>(The Library provides a complete, online, free training program about Action 
  Learning. Each video provides guidelines about each of the most important aspects 
  of Action Learning. See free video series, <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/act-lrn/gratis/">Action

<h2>What is Action Learning?</h2>

<a name="anchor1180818"></a>
<h3>Remember -- Action Learning is
a Framework Within Which There Can Be Variations</h3>

<p>It's important to note, when reviewing the information in this
topic, that the Action Learning process is a framework within
which there can be variations, including where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All members are from the same organization (an intact team)
  and work on the same priority.</li>
  <li>All members are from the same organization and each member
  might work on a different priority different from other members.</li>
  <li>All members are from different departments or organizations
  and work on the same priority.</li>
  <li>All members are from different departments or organizations
  and each member works on a priority different from other members.</li>
  <li>In these combinations, the priorities might be very familiar
  or unfamiliar to the members.</li>
  <li>Sets can be externally facilitated or self-facilitated.</li>
  <li>Members might meet face-to-face or via telecommunications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Practitioners often tend to favor one of the variations and
refer to that as &quot;Action Learning.&quot; However, the reader
will benefit most from continuing to remember the possible variations
of the overall Action Learning framework.</p>

<h2>Some Theories Underlying Action
Learning</h2>

<p>The Action Learning framework touches on so many aspects of
personal, professional and organizational development, that a
list of related theories would produce a very extensive list.
The following resources capture the unique theories, especially
behind the &quot;P&quot;s and &quot;Q&quot;s of Revans' core theory
behind Action Learning.</p>

<h2>Some Different Models and Aproaches of Action Learning</h2>

<p>The Action Learning framework also is so general in nature that numerous variations 
  and refinements have been done, and many of them have general or commercial 
  names. I apologize in advance if I have somehow mischaracterized a particular 
  model or approach below. (Similar to other fields and practices, it's natural 
  for proponents of a particular model or approach to refer to it as &quot;the&quot; 
  model :-)</p>

<h1>ACTION LEARNING COMPONENTS AND PROGRAMS</h1>

<a name="anchor1425899"></a>
<h2>Projects (Problems or Exciting Opportunities)</h2>

<p>The problem is the real-world priority that the Action Learning
group (set) is address. (Although the term &quot;problem&quot;
is traditional to Action Learning literature, many practitioners
might prefer to use the more appreciative term &quot;priority.&quot;)
The problem should be a current, real and urgent priority for
the individual, team, program or organization to address. Usually
there is no straightforward &quot;solution&quot; to the problem,
and the more urgent the problem, the more likely it will generate
useful and deep learning for the stakeholders (those who have
a direct or indirect interest in the problem). The group is charged
to clarify the problem, identify solutions, identify the most
likely solutions, take actions to implement the solutions -- and
generate learning along the way. In single-project Action Learning,
all members of the set work on the same problem. In multi-project
Action Learning, each member bring his/her own problem to address.</p>

<p>In single-project Action Learning, the problem should be closely aligned with 
  the priorities of the organization. Those priorities might be the result of 
  strategic or business planning, or the result of an organizational assessment. 
  Similarly, the problem might be the result of assessments among individuals.</p>

<a name="anchor1427874"></a>
<h2>Group (Set)</h2>

<p>The set is the group of people, usually six to eight, charged
to address the problem. The membership of the group depends on
the problem. In a single-project application, the member would
likely be from the same business unit, working on the same projects
or priorities. However, the more diverse the values, opinions
and perspectives of the members, the more unbiased, probing and
generative might be the questions shared among members -- and,
thus, the more learning generated among members.</p>

<p>In single-company Action Learning, all members are from the same company, and 
  sometimes they work on the same business function or project (they are an intact 
  team). In multi-company (or multi-department) Action Learning, each member is 
  from a different company or department.</p>

<h2>Coaching (Sharing Questions)</h2>

<p>A hallmark of the Action Learning process is the use of questions
among members. In contrast to most problem-solving groups, where
members start advocating their own opinions and advice, Action
Learning members share questions -- questions to analyze, understand
and solve problems. Questions generate deep thinking and reflection
about the problem. They ensure each person is highly involved
in -- and aware of -- his/her own perceptions, assumptions and
conclusions about the problem. Thus, each person more fully &quot;learns
how to learn,&quot; that is, accomplishes continuous learning.</p>

<p>One of the most important roles of the question is to clarify
the real problem, rather than the symptoms. Many times, it's more
important to understand the real problem than to start suggestions
various solutions that might solve it. Questions make each person
accountable to be involved and, thus, they often generate more
authenticity and involvement among members -- authenticity is
a critical element to any form of development.</p>

<p>Depending on the model of Action Learning, members might only interact via 
  questions and statements might only be made in response to questions.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>

<p>Another hallmark of Action Learning is that set members take
actions to address the problem. (Some recent literature about
Action Learning does not assert the need for actions among members.
This &quot;Americanized&quot; Action Learning is not likely to
generate the type of progress and learning so familiar to the
more &quot;European&quot; Action Learning where set members are
charged to take actions between meetings.</p>

<p>The actions, not only &quot;attack&quot; the problem, but they generate experiences 
  from which set members learn a great deal by reflecting on what they did, what 
  happened, what worked and what didn't, and how they can take that learning forward 
  in life and work. A major value of the questioning is that it ensures that the 
  actions are relevant and realistic, which is particularly important for very 
  busy people in the workplace.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>Learning, in Action Learning, comes especially from members'
reflection on the nature of the questions and answers among members,
and also from the nature and results of the actions taken between
meetings. The learning is not from analyzing and memorizing expert-based
content brought to the group by outside experts (although, the
&quot;Americanized&quot; Action Learning does tend to bring in
more outside experts than the European version). Reginald Revans,
the founder and original developer of Action Learning, often asserted
that this kind of &quot;programmed,&quot; or expert-based, learning
did not generate the ability to learn how to learn and, thus,
should be minimized as much as possible.</p>

<p>One of the early tasks of an Action Learning program is to orient set members 
  to the nature of learning, that it is not always the result of listening to 
  experts, memorizing their content and getting a good grade. Members are reminded 
  that some of the most important learning in their lives is from experiencing 
  and thinking about significant events, people and experiences in their lives. 
  Another task is to help members recognize learning when it happens -- that's 
  one of the major roles of the Action Learning coach.</p>

<h2>Facilitation of Meetings and Learnings</h2>

<p>(It's ironic to realize that founder of Action Learning, Reginald
Revans, did not want Action Learning to be &quot;packaged&quot;
into seemingly inaccessible models or that the role of &quot;facilitator&quot;
become professionalized such that the Action Learning process
seemed too complex for those who are not professionals in the
process. Yet, with the increasing importance and popularity of
Action Learning and its focus on urgent problems, people are often
more assured when using a highly trained external facilitator
and they often end up using the particular model of Action Learning
suggested by the facilitator.)</p>

<p>Note that many practitioners might prefer to this position
as the &quot;facilitator&quot; and to the members as being &quot;coaches.&quot;
In a self-facilitated set, the members are the coaches.</p>

<p>The primary role of the Coach is to orient members to the Action Learning process 
  and the nature of learning in Action Learning. The coach might initially work 
  with the person, or sponsor, of the Action Learning project to clarify the problem, 
  resources, timelines and membership of the sets. The coach should help the set 
  to establish ground rules, learn skills in presenting and listening and questioning, 
  and recognizing learning. The Coach might intervene at various times to affirm 
  a strong occasion of learning or affirm learning for a member or the set. Depending 
  on the model of Action Learning, the Coach might be the only one to do that 
  type of intervention.</p>

<h2>Designing and Developing Action Learning Programs</h2>

<p>Each Action Learning application should be customized to the needs and nature 
  of the person, group or organization. The program designer should first know 
  the basic Action Learning framework, which he/she can glean by reviewing the 
  resources at <a href="#anchor1181123"
class="textlink">Brief Description</a>, some of those at <a href="#anchor1185649"
class="textlink">Overviews of Process and Program Components</a>, and each of 
  the six components described above. The following resources provide complete 
  guidelines, but they are guidelines -- any detailed &quot;procedure&quot; would 
  be highly unique to the particular program. Perhaps, in the nature actions and 
  learning, the program designer should start a program, learn from those actions, 
  and then modify the program accordingly.</p>
