<p>Training and development -- or &quot;learning and development&quot; as many 
  refer to it now -- is one of the most important aspects of our lives and our 
  work. (Many people view &quot;training&quot; as an activity that produces the 
  result or outcome of &quot;learning&quot; -- and learning is typically viewed 
  as new knowledge, skills and competencies or abilities.) In our culture, we 
  highly value learning. Yet, despite our having attended many years of schooling, 
  many of us have no idea how to carefully design an approach to training and 
  development. This topic in the Library provides an extensive range of information 
  about training and development, including to depict how the many aspects of 
  training and development relate to each other. Also, this topic explains how 
  training and development can be used, informally or formally, to meet the nature 
  and needs of the reader.</p>

<h2 align="center">WHAT IS LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT? WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?</h2>
<h2><a name="understanding" id="understanding"></a>Understanding Learning and 
  Development</h2>

<p>It's amazing how so many of us go through so many years of schooling, but have 
  such little understanding of learning and development. Before reading about 
  the many aspects of learning and development in this topic in the Library, including 
  learning and development programs and practitioners, it's best to start with 
  a basic understanding of what learning and development is and how to best benefit 
  from it. Also, it's useful to understand the common terms and the sometimes 
  subtle differences between them.<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/basics/terms-in-training.htm">Basic Terms in 
  Training and Development (Knowledge, Skills, Training, Learning, etc.)</a></p>

<p>If you will be doing training and development with yourself (and almost every 
  adult will be at some time in their lives) or with others, you should know the 
  differences between training children and teens versus training adults. Adults 
  have very different nature and needs in training. Also, there are some common 
  beliefs about training that just aren't true. Understand those misconceptions 
  so you don't build your training around those illusions.<br />

  of -- and Myths About -- Adult Learning</a><br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/theory/theories-of-learning.htm">Theories 
  of Learning and Development</a></p>
<h2><a name="benefits" id="benefits"></a>Benefits of Learning and Development</h2>
<p>We often think that the biggest benefit of learning is that we get a diploma 
  or credential. As we get wiser, we realize there are so many more benefits than 
  that. Knowing the benefits will help motivate you to design your own training 
  plans and programs, and to motivate others to participate as well. Perhaps one 
  of the biggest benefits is the appreciation that you can be learning all the 
  time, even if you are not in a formal training program.<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/basics/reasons-for-training.htm">Employment Training 
  and Development: Reasons and Benefits</a></p>
<h2><a name="relationship" id="relationship"></a>Relationship of Learning and 
  Development to Performance</h2>
<p>We tend to assume that training leads to learning, which leads to doing better 
  in our lives and work -- it leads to increased performance. However, you will 
  very likely get more out of your trainings and be more successful in promoting 
  trainings to others if you understand more about the relationship between training 
  and performance. That understanding is especially useful when designing training 
  to increase performance or to redesign training programs that don't seem to 
  be as successful as you wish.<br />

  and HPT)</a></p>
<hr />
<h2 align="center">DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAINING AND ACTIVITIES</h2>
<h2><a name="informal" id="informal"></a>Informal Versus. Formal Training, Self-Directed 
  Versus Other-Directed Training</h2>

<p>There are different, major forms of learning and development. We're most familiar 
  with formal and other-directed forms of learning and development, that include 
  the strong attention to the systematic structure and evaluation of the learning 
  and development, especially as used in schooling. That is somewhat ironic, because 
  the most common forms of learning and development are informal and self-directed 
  -- they occur without strong attention to a systematic design and evaluation 
  and without many experts guiding us through those experiences.<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">Ways to Look at Training 
  and Development Processes: Informal/Formal and Self-Directed/Other-Directed</a></p>

<h2><a name="types" id="types"></a>Types of Activities for Learning and Development</h2>
<p>There are many approaches to learning and development and many types of activities 
  that can be undertaken to learn. We're most used to thinking of the formal, 
  other-directed activities, such as attending courses or lectures. However, most 
  of the types of learning are informal and unstructured. An awareness of these 
  other types will broaden your possibilities for intentional learning and for 
  designing training for yourself and others. <br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/index.htm">Various Ideas 
  for Learning Activities</a></p>
<h2><a name="movements" id="movements"></a>Movements in Organizational Training 
  and Development</h2>
<p>The field (or many would argue, the profession) of training and development 
  has undergone dramatic improvements, especially with the inclusion of computer- 
  and Web-based technologies. We're also expanding the concept of learning beyond 
  the learning of individuals -- we're thinking that groups and organizations 
  can learn, too. (Although the topics of the learning organization and knowledge 
  management are fairly recent and still popular, many people would disagree that 
  they're actually learning and development programs -- those people might assert 
  that they're actually forms of organizational performance management. However, 
  the two topics still seem to be so broad and changing, that they're referred 
  to here as movements.)<br />

<h2 align="center">PREPARATION FOR DEVELOPING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS</h2>
<h2><a name="examples" id="examples"></a>Examples of Programs in the Workplace</h2>
<p>Before this Library topic goes on to explaining how to design and develop training 
  programs, it's useful to get a quick impression of various types of training 
  programs. A <strong>training program </strong>is an intentionally designed, 
  (hopefully) highly integrated set of activities that are aligned to accomplish 
  a certain set of results among learners. Many of us might not be used to thinking 
  of the following as programs in the workplace, but they are.<br />

<h2><a name="transfer" id="transfer"></a>How to Ensure Transfer of Training -- 
  Training That Sticks</h2>

<p>One of the biggest concerns of trainers -- and those paying for training -- 
  is whether the learners will indeed understand and apply the new information 
  and materials from the learning and development activities, that is, whether 
  the new information and materials will transfer to the learners. The following 
  link is to many resources with guidelines to increase the likelihood of transfer 
  of training. <br />

  of Training -- How to Reinforce Learning</a></p>

<h2><a name="suggestions" id="suggestions"></a>Suggestions to Enrich the Activities 
  of Learning and Development</h2>
<p>Now we'll tie the many guidelines together into a set of suggestions that will 
  be useful, especially when undergoing or designing training programs for yourself 
  and others. The second link is to a guide you could consider when designing 
  a training program. <br />

<h2 align="center">DEVELOPING SYSTEMATIC TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS</h2>
<h2><a name="addies" id="addies"></a>Instructional System Design (ISD) and the 
  ADDIE Model</h2>

<p>Formal approaches to learning and development often have the highest likelihood 
  of transfer of training. A formal approach to learning and development usually 
  follows a systematic and consistent framework. Systematic means that the framework 
  is designed to guide learners to achieve an overall set of goals -- goals to 
  address a need or situation, then associates objectives and activities to achieve 
  those overall goals, and evaluates the activities and results to be sure the 
  goals were achieved. Instructional system design (ISD) is the activities to 
  ensure that the design of training is very successful in achieving the goals 
  of the training. One of the most common ISD models is ADDIE, which is an acronym 
  for assessment, design, development, implementation and evaluation -- you can 
  discern from the acronym that ADDIES is a systematic design of training.<br />

  Processes -- Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and ADDIE</a><br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm">Example Guidelines 
  to Design Your Training Plan</a></p>
<h2><a name="phase1" id="phase1"></a>ADDIE Phase 1 -- Assessing Your Training 
  Needs: Needs Assessment to Training Goals</h2>
<p>What overall results or outcomes should be accomplished by learners? Those 
  outcomes usually are identified from the results of <b>assessments</b>, or measurements, 
  of what a person or workplace needs to accomplish in order to achieve some desired 
  level of performance. An outcome might be the ability to perform a complex job.<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/needs-assessment.htm">Training Needs 
  Assessment and Analysis: Identifying Training Goals</a></p>
<h2><a name="phase2" id="phase2"></a>ADDIE Phase 2 -- Designing Training Plans 
  and Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>What learning objectives must be accomplished by learners in order to achieve 
  the overall outcomes, and what activities must be undertaken by trainers and 
  learners to accomplish those objectives? The integration of the overall outcomes, 
  objectives and activities and also how they will be evaluated comprise the <b>design</b> 
  of the learning and development program. Learning objectives often are described 
  in terms of new learning -- new knowledge, skills and competencies.<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm">Designing Training 
  Plans and Learning Objectives</a></p>
<h2><a name="phase3" id="phase3"></a>ADDIE Phase 3 -- Developing Training Activities 
  and Materials </h2>
<p>Now it's important to get even more clear on what resources must be obtained 
  and developed in order to undertake the activities to achieve the objectives. 
  Resource might include certain expertise, facilities and technologies. Development 
  might include several trainers and learners reviewing the design of the training 
  to ensure it meets their nature and needs. <br />

  Training Activities and Materials </a></p>
<h2><a name="phase4" id="phase4"></a>ADDIE Phase 4 -- Implementing Your Training 
  Program</h2>
<p>Now you're ready to have trainers and learners participate in the program, 
  to undertake the activities and evaluations of learning. Implementation often 
  results in refining the original design of the training program. <br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/implementing-training.htm">Implementing 
  Training: Conducting the Training with Learners</a></p>
<h2><a name="phase5" id="phase5"></a>ADDIE Phase 5 -- Evaluating Your Training 
  Program</h2>
<p>As trainers and learners participate in the program, evaluation should occur 
  of the quality of the activities and the extent of achievement of the objectives. 
  After the program, evaluation should occur to assess the extent of achievement 
  of the overall goals of the program. Evaluation might focus on short-term, intermediate 
  and long-term outcomes.<br />

<h2><a name="management" id="management"></a>Management of Learning and Development 
  Programs and Activities</h2>

<p>Learning and development activities must be carefully led and managed -- many 
  people would argue that they're not unlike other functions in organizations, 
  such as planning, marketing and financial management. The following roles might
