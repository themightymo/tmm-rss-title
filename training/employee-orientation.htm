<h2>What is Orientation? What is On-Boarding?</h2>
<p>Planning an orientation to employees should be as carefully done as planning 
  a systematic approach to training. For example, there should be overall goals 
  that you want to accomplish with the orientation. There should be carefully 
  chosen activities and materials used in the orientation to achieve the goals. 
  Participants should produce certain tangible results that can be referenced 
  to evaluate the orientation both during and after the orientation.</p>
<p>A progressive view of orientation is that of &quot;on-boarding.&quot; On-boarding 
  works from the perspective that the organization must do all it can to fully 
  equip the employee for maximum performance for the organization -- and for maximum 
  fulfillment of the employee. Some organizations have on-boarding programs that 
  last up to a year, where the employee experiences a several-day orientation 
  program, which includes, not only the orientation to the facilities and personnel, 
  but also various self-assessments for the employee to get clear on what he or 
  she wants from employment in the organization. The employee might be placed 
  in a peer group of fellow, new employees who share advice and other feedback 
  to learn more about the company and other roles in the organization. </p>
<h2><a name="checklist" id="checklist"></a>Basic Checklist to Orient Employees</h2>
<p>While the approach to on-boarding is usually quite unique to the nature and 
  needs of an organization, here's a checklist that can be used to orient an employee 
  to an organization. The following activities should be conducted by the employee's 
  supervisor. The checklist is relevant to the activities that should occur after 
  the employee has received a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/hiring.htm">job 
  offer</a>. </p>
<h3><b>Before the Employee Begins Employment, Send a Welcome Letter</b></h3>
<p> Verify the exact starting date and also provide a copy of the employee policies 
  and procedures manual. Note that you'll dedicate time for them to review the 
  manual later. Do not specify the terms of salary and compensation -- that should 
  have been included in the job offer. </p>
<h3>Provide a Job Description and Any Suggested Performance Goals</h3>
<p>All employees deserve explanation of what is expected from them. A job description, 
  which explains duties and responsibilities, often is not enough. Therefore, 
  suggest some additional areas of focus, ideally in the context of performance 
  goals for the employee to address especially during the first year of employment. 
  Make it clear that you will discuss these with the employee soon. </p>
<h3><b>When the Employee Begins Employment, Meet With Them Right Away</b></h3>
<p> Explain how they will be trained, introduce them to staff, give them keys, 
  get them to sign any needed benefit and tax forms, explain the time-recording 
  system (if applicable), and provide them copies of important documents (an organization 
  chart, last year's final report, the strategic plan, this year's budget, and 
  the employee's policies and procedure manual if they did not get one already.</p>
<h3><b>Show Them the Facilities</b></h3>
<p> Show them the layout of offices, bathrooms, storage areas, kitchen use, copy 
  and fax systems, computer configuration and procedures, telephone usage and 
  any special billing procedures for use of office systems. Review any Policies 
  and/or procedures about use of facilities.</p>
<h3><b>Schedule Any Needed Computer Training</b></h3>
<p> Include training about the most frequently used software applications. Be 
  sure the employees learn any security procedures for computer information, including 
  careful use of passwords, overview of location of manuals and other useful documentation, 
  location and use of computer networks and other peripherals, and where to go 
  to get questions answered.</p>
<h3><b>Assign a Staff Member As Their &quot;Buddy&quot;</b> </h3>
<p>This is extremely important. Identify another employee, other than you (the 
  supervisor), that the employee might quickly establish rapport with, to pose 
  any questions that the employee is not comfortable posing to the supervisor. 
  The buddy can invite the new employee to various social functions undertaken 
  by other employees. </p>
<h3><b>Take Them to Lunch on the First Day</b> </h3>
<p>Use this opportunity to be with them in other than a work setting. Don't talk 
  about work. Ask them about their family and share some information about yourself. 
</p>
<h3><b>Meet With Them at the End of the Day</b> </h3>
<p>Take just a few minutes to ask if they have any questions or any needs they'd 
  like to talk about. Remind them that you or their buddy is there if they have 
  any questions or needs. </p>
<h3><b>Meet Again With the New Employee During the First Few Days</b> </h3>
<p>Review the job description again. Remind them to review the employee manual 
  and sign a form indicating they have reviewed the manual and will comply with 
  its contents. Review any specific performance goals for the position. In the 
  same meeting, explain the performance review procedure and provide them a copy 
  of the performance review document.</p>
<h3><b>Have One-On-One Meetings On a Weekly Basis for the First Six Weeks</b></h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes of new supervisors is to meet with direct reports 
  only when there are problems. That sends the message &quot;I'm only here if 
  you have a problem, and you better not have any problems.&quot; Instead, meet 
  to discuss the new employee's transition into the organization, get status on 
  work activities, hear any pending issues or needs, and establish a working relationship 
  with the new employee.</p>
