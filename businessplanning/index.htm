<h2>Why Do a Business Plan?</h2>

<h3>Uses and Benefits of a Business Plan</h3>

<p>A business plan is often prepared when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starting a new organization, business venture, or product
  (service) or</li>
  <li>Expanding, acquiring or improving any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are numerous benefits of doing a business plan, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To identify an problems in your plans before you implement
  those plans.</li>
  <li>To get the commitment and participation of those who will
  implement the plans, which leads to better results.</li>
  <li>To establish a roadmap to compare results as the venture
  proceeds from paper to reality.</li>
  <li>To achieve greater profitability in your organization, products
  and services -- all with less work.</li>
  <li>To obtain financing from investors and funders.</li>
  <li>To minimize your risk of failure.</li>
  <li>To update your plans and operations in a changing world.</li>
  <li>To clarify and synchronize your goals and strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, the planning process often is as useful
as the business plan document itself.</p>

<a name="anchor12"></a>
<h2>Types of Content of a Business Plan</h2>

<p>Business plans appear in many different formats, depending
on the audience for the plan and complexity of the business. However,
most business plans address the following five topic areas in
one form or another.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Business summary</b> -- Describes the organization,
  business venture or product (service), summarizing its purpose,
  management, operations, marketing and finances.</li>
  <li><b>Market opportunity</b> -- Concisely describes
  what unmet need it will (or does) fill, presents evidence that
  this need is genuine, and that the beneficiaries (or a third
  party) will pay for the costs to meet this need. Describes credible
  market research on target customers (including perceived benefits
  and willingness to pay), competitors and pricing.</li>
  <li><b>People</b> -- Arguably the most important part
  of the plan, it describes who will be responsible for developing,
  marketing and operating this venture, and why their backgrounds
  and skills make them the right people to make this successful.
  Ideally, each person in the management team (and key program
  and technical folks) are indicated by NAME.</li>
  <li><b>Implementation</b> -- This is the how-to section
  of the plan, where the action steps are clearly described, usually
  in four areas: start-up, marketing, operations and financial.
  Marketing builds on market research presented, e.g., in a Market
  Opportunity section of the plan, including your competitive niche
  (how you will be better than your competitors in ways that matter
  to your target customers). Financial plan includes, e.g., costs
  to launch, operate, market and finance the business, along with
  conservative estimates of revenue, typically for three years;
  a break-even analysis is often included in this section.</li>
  <li><b>Contingencies</b> -- This section outlines the
  most likely things that could go wrong with implementing this
  plan, and how management is prepared to respond to those problems
  if they emerge.</li>
</ol>

<p>In many cases, an organization will already have in its possession
some of the information needed for preparing a business plan.
For example, in the case of nonprofits, grant proposals often
contain some of this information.</p>

<h2>Preparation for Planning a Business Venture (nonprofit or
for-profit)</h2>

<p>Before you start a major venture, there are several considerations
about yourself that you should address. This manual guides you
through those considerations. Then the manual guides you through
the major considerations you'll have to address when you complete
your business plan. The manual includes numerous links to other
free resources as the reader goes through each section of the

<h2>Nonprofit Business Planning</h2>

<h3>How to Translate For-Profit Plans to Nonprofit Plans, If Needed</h3>

<p>For-profit and nonprofit business plans have many similarities.
For that reason, nonprofit personnel would benefit from reading
the links in the section above, &quot;For-Profit Business Planning&quot;.
Some of the terms are different, but in most cases they can readily
be translated into words more commonly used in the nonprofit sector.
For example, &quot;balance sheet&quot; is what nonprofit call
a &quot;statement of financial position&quot;, &quot;profit and
loss statement&quot; (or income statement) is essentially the
same as a &quot;statement of financial activities&quot;, and so
on.</p>
