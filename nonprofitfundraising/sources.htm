<h2>General Guidelines
for Fundraising</h2>


In addition to the guidelines included in the large amount of
other fundraising information referenced from the library:<br />
&middot; Ensure the board is strongly involved in fundraising
planning and implementation<br />
&middot; Develop fundraising goals to be the resources needed
to reach the strategic goals identified during strategic planning<br />
&middot; Identify a variety of funding sources for each goal and
the particular fundraising strategies preferred by each of the
sources (the above-mentioned Web page provides a good overview
of various strategies and where they should be used)<br />
&middot; Ensure your plans specify who will be doing what fundraising,
so you don't have sources who become overwhelmed or irritated
by repeated solicitations from different people in your organization<br />
<br />
&quot;The Complete Guide to Nonprofit Management&quot; by Smith,
Bucklin and Associates suggests:<br />
&middot; The most important aspect of fundraising is excellent
public relations, that is, ensuring that your community has a
strong, positive impression of your organization<br />
&middot; Establish an organizational structure to implement the
fundraising plan, including:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>Board Executive Committee</i> - Establishes priorities
  and goals and approves the plan
<p><i>Outreach/Marketing Committee -</i> Identifies potential
  donors and coordinates efforts to promote fundraising
<p><i>Fundraising Committee -</i> Leads development and implementation
  of the plan, and approaches donors
<p><i>Volunteer Coordinator -</i> Coordinates volunteer efforts,
  including identifying where volunteers might help, recruiting
  volunteers, ensuring they are effective and that they are recognized
<p><i>Information processing -</i> Assign staff to develop and
  maintain the fundraising database
<p><i>Accounting -</i> Be sure to include moneys raised in your
  accounting system
<p><i>Donation processing -</i> Have staff available to process
  donations (cashing checks, sending notes of appreciation, updating
  the fundraising database, etc.)<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>&middot; Most fundraising is done in the fall of the year when
corporations are doing their planning for the following year<br />
&middot; Corporations typically require a written proposal<br />
&middot; Foundations rarely fund operating costs, that is, costs
to support central administration of an organization, rather than
specific programs which directly deliver services<br />
&middot; Consider approaching a local advertising, marketing or
public relations firm for pro bono advice. Regularly send these
companies evidence of the successes of your organization to keep
them up to date on your organization.<br />
&middot; Consider using third-class mailing, which is cheaper
than first-class, but sometimes takes as much as two weeks longer
to arrive. Expedite arrival of third-class mail by using bar codes
and nine-digit zip codes.<br />

<h2>Information
for Smaller Nonprofits</h2>

For smaller nonprofits (e.g., with budgets under $100,000 or so),
Smith, Bucklin and Associates (in &quot;The Complete Guide to
Nonprofit Management&quot;) recommend:<br />
&middot; Start with internal solicitations to board members, staff
and members of your organization (if you are chartered on a membership
basis).<br />
&middot; Look to the donors who can make the largest contributions.
Write them, call them and arrange a visit. Offer a co-sponsorship
to events.<br />
&middot; Next, prepare a detailed donor list and offer them a
range of options.<br />
&middot; Then go to the smaller donations list.<br />
