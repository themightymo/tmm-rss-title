<h1>Social Enterprise and Social Entrepreneurship</h1>
<p>Social enterprise is, fundamentally, about using a market-driven business model 
  to address key social and environmental issues. It is an emerging field with 
  diverse and shifting interpretations. In this page, we'll try to sort through 
  all this, introduce you to the major players, and give you a launching pad for

<h3 class="western">What Social Enterprise Is</h3>
<p>Social enterprise is, fundamentally, about using a market-driven
business model to address critical social and environmental issues.
It is about making the world a better place. But don't just take my
word for it:</p>

<p>Many people believe that a fundamental element of social
enterprise - indeed, the "social" in social enterprise - is
collective ownership.</p>

	</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Until we come up with a broader term than "social
enterprise", I'll advocate for a broad interpretation that does
not limit it to collectively-owned businesses. If the overarching
purpose of the business is to address a social and/or environmental
issue, it's a social enterprise - regardless of its ownership
structure. This is a pragmatic position; the world's problems are far
too great to be creating arbitrary silos that limit participation and
sharing.</p>
<h3 class="western">What Social Enterprise Is Not</h3>
<p>Social enterprise is not about balancing the "double bottom
lines" of profit and social impact, <i>as though they are
equally important.</i> The real bottom line for a social enterprise,
the goal by which its success should ultimately be evaluated, is its
social (or environmental) impact, and being profitable (or at least
financially sustainable) is the entirely necessary <i>means to that
end</i>. Of course, there can be no social mission without money, but
the first goal is mission.</p>
<p>Social enterprise is not the exclusive domain of nonprofits - See
"What Social Enterprise Is" above. While  nonprofits have
been - and continue to be - leaders in the social enterprise
movement, social enterprise need not be limited to nonprofits.
Moreover, simply being owned by a nonprofit is not sufficient to make
a business a social enterprise. The enterprise must have as its
overarching purpose the amelioration of social and/or environmental
issues.</p>
<p>Social enterprise is not just another fundraising strategy for
nonprofits - While it's possible for a social enterprise that is
owned by a nonprofit to generate funds to support the operation of
that nonprofit, the generation of those funds is secondary to the
direct impact it has on social or environmental issues. If generating
funds is your biggest priority, check out the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfundraising/index.htm">fundraising
topic</a> in this Library.</p>
<p>Social enterprise is not about "saving" the nonprofit
sector - While social enterprise has great potential for enhancing
the vitality and sustainability of the nonprofit sector, that
potential impact is secondary to its real purpose - helping
(directly, through the operation of the business) to make the world a
better place.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="anchor13746"></a>Why Social Enterprise
Matters</h2>
<p>Social enterprise matters because it is focused on making positive
change at a time when we desperately need it. Social enterprise is
one important tool, among many, that is actively and directly making
our world a better place.</p>
<p>Social enterprise is more responsive. Social enterprise doesn't
rely on the shifting priorities of government and major foundations;
it gets on with making the change that is needed within a community
and (sometimes) grows to affect whole cities, countries, and regions.</p>
<p>Social enterprise is scalable. Like all businesses, social
enterprise has, with investment and sales revenue, the ability to
grow to meet needs and priorities of the communities it serves, as
opposed to traditional nonprofit programs, which are often limited to
the funds available from government and philanthropic funders.</p>
<p>Social enterprise actively engages stakeholders. Social enterprise
gives the people it helps a direct voice in the operation of the
business - as owners, employees and paying customers.</p>

Fields and Topics</h2>
<h3 class="western">Social Innovation</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/rediscovering_social_innovation/" target="_blank">"Rediscovering
Social Innovation"</a> (Fall 2008 issue of the <a href="http://www.ssireview.org/" target="_blank">Stanford
Social Innovation Review</a>), social innovation is defined as "a
novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient,
sustainable, or just than existing solutions and for which the value
created accrues primarily to society as a whole rather than private
individuals." So defined, social innovation is a bigger concept
than social enterprise, which is not limited to enterprise-based
approaches to addressing critical issues. Put another way, social
enterprise can be a vehicle for social innovation.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://facilitationprocess.com/dimensions-of-social-innovation" target="_blank">Dimensions
of Social Innovation.</a></p>
<h3 class="western">Social Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ashoka.org/" target="_blank">Ashoka</a> defines social
entrepreneurship as "individuals with innovative solutions to
society’s most pressing social problems. They are ambitious and
persistent, tackling major social issues and offering new ideas for
wide-scale change. Rather than leaving societal needs to the
government or business sectors, social entrepreneurs find what is not
working and solve the problem by changing the system, spreading the
solution, and persuading entire societies to take new leaps." So
defined, social entrepreneurship is concerned with the entrepreneurs
who undertake large-scale social innovation - which may or may not
involve a social enterprise. See <a href="http://www.ashoka.org/social_entrepreneur/" target="_blank">"What
is a Social Entrepreneur"</a> for a list of people who meet
Ashoka's definition.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.grameen-info.org/" target="_blank">Grameen Bank</a> is a
great example of a social enterprise which, led by social
entrepreneur <a href="http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=329&amp;Itemid=363">Muhammad
Yunus</a>, popularized the social innovation of <a href="http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=170">microcredit</a>.</p>

(and Problems) with Microcredit</a>.</p>
<h3 class="western">Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>
<p>CSR is, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility" target="_blank">many</a>,
about maximizing shareholder value in a way that minimizes negative
social or environmental impacts. To the extent that this is the case,
profit is the first goal and minimizing harm (not making things
better) is the secondary goal. CSR is way better than business as
usual, but it's not social enterprise. See the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/index.htm">Business
Ethics</a> topic for more information.</p>
