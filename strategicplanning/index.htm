<h1>All About Strategic Planning</h1>

<p>Simply put, strategic planning determines where an organization is going over 
  the next year or more, how it's going to get there and how it'll know if it 
  got there or not. The focus of a strategic plan is usually on the entire organization, 
  while the focus of a business plan is usually on a particular product, service 
  or program. There are a variety of perspectives, models and approaches used 
  in strategic planning. The way that a strategic plan is developed depends on 
  the nature of the organization's leadership, culture of the organization, complexity 
  of the organization's environment, size of the organization and expertise of 
  planners. If you need more help, <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/services/strat-plan.html"><br />

<h2>UNDERSTANDING STRATEGIC PLANNING</h2>

<p><a name="anchor1234"></a></p>

<h3>Introduction -- What is Strategic Planning?</h3>

<a name="anchor2753"></a>
<h4>There Are Various Different Views
and Models -- and the Process You Use Depends</h4>

<p>Simply put, strategic planning determines where an organization
is going over the next year or more, how it's going to get there
and how it'll know if it got there or not. The focus of a strategic
plan is usually on the entire organization, while the focus of
a business plan is usually on a particular product, service or
program.</p>

<p>There are a variety of perspectives, models and approaches
used in strategic planning. The way that a strategic plan is developed
depends on the nature of the organization's leadership, culture
of the organization, complexity of the organization's environment,
size of the organization, expertise of planners, etc. For example,
there are a variety of strategic planning models, including goals-based,
issues-based, organic, scenario (some would assert that scenario
planning is more of a technique than model), etc.</p>

<p>1) Goals-based planning is probably the most common and starts
with focus on the organization's mission (and vision and/or values),
goals to work toward the mission, strategies to achieve the goals,
and action planning (who will do what and by when).</p>

<p>2) Issues-based strategic planning often starts by examining
issues facing the organization, strategies to address those issues
and action plans.</p>

<p>3) Organic strategic planning might start by articulating the
organization's vision and values, and then action plans to achieve
the vision while adhering to those values. Some planners prefer
a particular approach to planning, eg, appreciative inquiry.</p>

<p>Some plans are scoped to one year, many to three years, and
some to five to ten years into the future. Some plans include
only top-level information and no action plans. Some plans are
five to eight pages long, while others can be considerably longer.</p>

<p>Quite often, an organization's strategic planners already know
much of what will go into a strategic plan (this is true for business
planning, too). However, development of the strategic plan greatly
helps to clarify the organization's plans and ensure that key
leaders are all &quot;on the same script&quot;. Far more important
than the strategic plan document, is the strategic planning process
itself.</p>

<p>Also, in addition to the size of the organization, differences
in how organizations carry out the planning activities are more
of a matter of the nature of the participants in the organization
-- than its for-profit/nonprofit status. For example, detail-oriented
people may prefer a linear, top-down, general-to-specific approach
to planning. On the other hand, rather artistic and highly reflective
people may favor of a highly divergent and &quot;organic&quot;
approach to planning.</p>

<p>NOTE: Much of the following information is in regard to goals-based
strategic planning, probably the most common form of strategic
planning. However, issues-based planning is also a very popular
approach to strategic planning -- an approach still too-often
forgotten.</p>

<a name="anchor3926"></a>
<h4>For-Profit Versus Nonprofit Strategic
Planning</h4>

<p>Major differences in how organizations carry out the <i>various
steps and associated activities</i> in the strategic planning
process are more of a matter of the size of the organization --
<i>than its for-profit/nonprofit status</i>. Small nonprofits
and small for-profits tend to conduct somewhat similar planning
activities that are different from those conducted in large organizations.
On the other hand, large nonprofits and large for-profits tend
to conduct somewhat similar planning activities that are different
from those conducted in small organizations. (The focus of the
planning activities is often different between for-profits and
nonprofits. Nonprofits tend to focus more on matters of board
development, fundraising and volunteer management. For-profits
tend to focus more on activities to maximize profit.)</p>

<p><i>Therefore, the reader is encouraged to review a variety
of the materials linked from this page, whether he or she is from
a nonprofit or for-profit organization.</i> Items below are marked
as &quot;nonprofit&quot; in case the reader still prefers to focus
on information presented in the context of nonprofit planning.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Strategic Planning</h3>

<p>Strategic planning serves a variety of purposes in organizations,
including to:<br />
1. Clearly define the purpose of the organization and to establish
realistic goals and objectives consistent with that mission in
a defined time frame within the organization&#146;s capacity for
implementation.<br />
2. Communicate those goals and objectives to the organization&#146;s
constituents.<br />
3. Develop a sense of ownership of the plan.<br />
4. Ensure the most effective use is made of the organization&#146;s
resources by focusing the resources on the key priorities.<br />
5. Provide a base from which progress can be measured and establish
a mechanism for informed change when needed.<br />
6. Listen to everyone&#146;s opinions in order to build consensus
about where the organization is going.</p>

<p>Other reasons include that strategic planning:<br />
7. Provides clearer focus for the organization, thereby producing
more efficiency and effectiveness.<br />
8. Bridges staff/employees and the board of directors (in the
case of corporations).<br />
9. Builds strong teams in the board and in the staff/employees
(in the case of corporations).<br />
10. Provides the glue that keeps the board members together (in
the case of corporations).<br />
11.Produces great satisfaction and meaning among planners, especially
around a common vision.<br />
12. Increases productivity from increased efficiency and effectiveness.<br />
13. Solves major problems in the organization.</p>

Discretionary at All</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor4293716937"></a></p>

<h3>When Should Strategic Planning Be Done?</h3>

<p>The scheduling for the strategic planning process depends on
the nature and needs of the organization and the its immediate
external environment. For example, planning should be carried
out frequently in an organization whose products and services
are in an industry that is changing rapidly . In this situation,
planning might be carried out once or even twice a year and done
in a very comprehensive and detailed fashion (that is, with attention
to mission, vision, values, environmental scan, issues, goals,
strategies, objectives, responsibilities, time lines, budgets,
etc). On the other hand, if the organization has been around for
many years and is in a fairly stable marketplace, then planning
might be carried out once a year and only certain parts of the
planning process, for example, action planning (objectives, responsibilities,
time lines, budgets, etc) are updated each year. Consider the
following guidelines:<br />
1. Strategic planning should be done when an organization is just
getting started. (The strategic plan is usually part of an overall
business plan, along with a marketing plan, financial plan and
operational/management plan.) <br />
2. Strategic planning should also be done in preparation for a
new major venture, for example, developing a new department, division,
major new product or line of products, etc. <br />
3. Strategic planning should also be conducted at least once a
year in order to be ready for the coming fiscal year (the financial
management of an organization is usually based on a year-to-year,
or fiscal year, basis). In this case, strategic planning should
be conducted in time to identify the organizational goals to be
achieved at least over the coming fiscal year, resources needed
to achieve those goals, and funded needed to obtain the resources.
These funds are included in budget planning for the coming fiscal
year. However, not all phases of strategic planning need be fully
completed each year. The full strategic planning process should
be conducted at least once every three years. As noted above,
these activities should be conducted every year if the organization
is experiencing tremendous change. <br />
4. Each year, action plans should be updated.<br />
5. Note that, during implementation of the plan, the progress
of the implementation should be reviewed at least on a quarterly
basis by the board. Again, the frequency of review depends on
the extent of the rate of change in and around the organization.</p>

<h3>Various Overviews of Strategic Planning Processes and Samples
of Strategic Planning Process</h3>

<p>NOTE: Although there are separate sections listed below for
many of the major activities in strategic planning (for example,
the sections &quot;Developing a Mission&quot;, &quot;Developing
a Vision&quot;, etc.), this section &quot;Various Overviews of
Strategic Planning&quot; also includes information about those
activities as well. The reader might scan 8-10 of the articles
to get a basic feel for strategic planning processes and the diversity
of views on the processes. However, do not conclude that you can
learn the most important aspects of strategic planning by reading
some of the following articles -- many of them are by authors
who write about certain aspects of strategic planning, but not
all aspects, so be sure to review resources in other subtopics
of this overall topic of strategic planning.</p>

<h3>Guidelines to Keep Perspective During Planning</h3>

<p>Many managers spend most of their time &quot;fighting fires&quot;
in the workplace. -- their time is spent realizing and reacting
to problems. For these managers -- and probably for many of us
-- it can be very difficult to stand back and take a hard look
at what we want to accomplish and how we want to accomplish it.
We're too buy doing what we think is making progress. However,
one of the major differences between new and experienced managers
is the skill to see the broad perspective, to take the long view
on what we want to do and how we're going to do it. One of the
best ways to develop this skill is through ongoing experience
in strategic planning. The following guidelines may help you to
get the most out of your strategic planning experience.<br />
1. The real benefit of the strategic planning process is the process,
not the plan document. <br />
2. There is no &quot;perfect&quot; plan. There's doing your best
at strategic thinking and implementation, and learning from what
you're doing to enhance what you're doing the next time around.
<br />
3. The strategic planning process is usually not an &quot;aha!&quot;
experience. It's like the management process itself -- it's a
series of small moves that together keep the organization doing
things right as it heads in the right direction. <br />
4. In planning, things usually aren't as bad as you fear nor as
good as you'd like.<br />
5. Start simple, but start!</p>

<h3>Useful Skills to Have When Strategic Planning</h3>

<p>It's best to have a team of planners conduct strategic planning.
Therefore, it's important to have skills in developing and facilitating
groups. <br />

<h3>Need Consultant or Facilitator to Help You With Planning?</h3>

<p>You may want to consider using a facilitator from outside of
your organization if:<br />
1. Your organization has not conducted strategic planning before.<br />
2. For a variety of reasons, previous strategic planning was not
deemed to be successful.<br />
3. There appears to be a wide range of ideas and/or concerns among
organization members about strategic planning and current organizational
issues to be addressed in the plan.<br />
4. There is no one in the organization who members feel has sufficient
facilitation skills.<br />
5. No one in the organization feels committed to facilitating
strategic planning for the organization.<br />
6. Leaders believe that an inside facilitator will either inhibit
participation from others or will not have the opportunity to
fully participate in planning themselves.<br />
7. Leaders want an objective voice, i.e., someone who is not likely
to have strong predispositions about the organization's strategic
issues and ideas.</p>

<h3>Who Should Be Involved in Planning?</h3>

<p>Strategic planning should be conducted by a planning team.
Consider the following guidelines when developing the team. <br />
(Note that reference to boards of directors is in regard to organizations
that are corporations.)<br />
1. The chief executive and board chair should be included in the
planning group, and should drive development and implementation
of the plan.<br />
2. Establish clear guidelines for membership, for example, those
directly involved in planning, those who will provide key information
to the process, those who will review the plan document, those
who will authorize the document, etc. <br />
3. A primary responsibility of a board of directors is strategic
planning to effectively lead the organization. Therefore, insist
that the board be strongly involved in planning, often including
assigning a planning committee (often, the same as the executive
committee). <br />
4. Ask if the board membership is representative of the organization&#146;s
clientele and community, and if they are not, the organization
may want to involve more representation in planning. If the board
chair or chief executive balks at including more of the board
members in planning, then the chief executive and/or board chair
needs to seriously consider how serious the organization is about
strategic planning!<br />
5. Always include in the group, at least one person who ultimately
has authority to make strategic decisions, for example, to select
which goals will be achieved and how. <br />
6. Ensure that as many stakeholders as possible are involved in
the planning process.<br />
7. Involve at least those who are responsible for composing and
implementing the plan.<br />
8. Involve someone to administrate the process, including arranging
meetings, helping to record key information, helping with flipcharts,
monitoring status of prework, etc.<br />
9. Consider having the above administrator record the major steps
in the planning process to help the organization conduct its own
planning when the plan is next updated.</p>

<p>Note the following considerations:<br />
10. Different types of members may be needed more at different
times in the planning process, for example, strong board involvement
in determining the organization&#146;s strategic direction (mission,
vision, and values), and then more staff involvement in determining
the organization&#146;s strategic analysis to determine its current
issues and goals, and then primarily the staff to determine the
strategies needed to address the issues and meet the goals.<br />
11. In general, where there's any doubt about whether a certain
someone should be involved in planning, it's best to involve them.
It's worse to exclude someone useful then it is to have one or
two extra people in planning -- this is true in particular with
organizations where board members often do not have extensive
expertise about the organization and its products or services.<br />
12. Therefore, an organization may be better off to involve board
and staff planners as much as possible in all phases of planning.
Mixing the board and staff during planning helps board members
understand the day-to-day issues of the organization, and helps
the staff to understand the top-level issues of the organization.</p>

<h3>How Many Planning Meetings Will We Need?</h3>

<h4>Number and Duration of Planning Meetings</h4>

<p>1. New planners usually want to know how many meetings will
be needed and what is needed for each meeting, i.e., they want
a procedure for strategic planning. The number of meetings depends
on whether the organization has done planning before, how many
strategic issues and goals the organization faces, whether the
culture of the organization prefers short or long meetings, and
how much time the organization is willing to commit to strategic
planning.<br />
2. Attempt to complete strategic planning in at most two to three
months, or momentum will be lost and the planning effort may fall
apart.</p>

<h4>Scheduling of Meetings</h4>

<p>1. Have each meeting at most two to three weeks apart when
planning. It's too easy to lose momentum otherwise.<br />
2. The most important factor in accomplishing complete attendance
to planning meetings is evidence of strong support from executives.
Therefore, ensure that executives a) issue clear direction that
they strongly support and value the strategic planning process,
and b) are visibly involved in the planning process.</p>

<h4>An Example Planning Process and Design of Meetings</h4>

<p>One example of a brief planning process is the following which
includes four planning meetings and develops a top-level strategic
plan which is later translated into a yearly operating plan by
the staff:<br />
1. Planning starts with a half-day or all-day board retreat and
includes introductions by the board chair and/or chief executive,
their explanations of the organization's benefits from strategic
planning and the organization's commitment to the planning process,
the facilitator's overview of the planning process, and the board
chairs and/or chief executive&#146;s explanation of who will be
involved in the planning process. In the retreat, the organization
may then begin the next step in planning, whether this be visiting
their mission, vision, values, etc. or identifying current issues
and goals to which strategies will need to be developed. (Goals
are often reworded issues.) Planners are asked to think about
strategies before the next meeting.<br />
2. The next meeting focuses on finalizing strategies to deal with
each issue. Before the next meeting, a subcommittee is charged
to draft the planning document, which includes updated mission,
vision, and values, and also finalized strategic issues, goals,
strategies. This document is distributed before the next meeting.<br />
3. In the next meeting, planners exchange feedback about the content
and format of the planning document. Feedback is incorporated
in the document and it is distributed before the next meeting.<br />
4. The next meeting does not require entire attention to the plan,
e.g., the document is authorized by the board during a regular
board meeting.<br />
5. Note that in the above example, various subcommittees might
be charged to gather additional information and distribute it
before the next planning meeting. <br />
6 Note, too, that the staff may take this document and establish
a yearly operating plan which details what strategies will be
implemented over the next year, who will do them, and by when.<br />
7. No matter how serious organizations are about strategic planning,
they usually have strong concerns about being able to find time
to attend frequent meetings. This concern can be addressed by
ensuring meetings are well managed, having short meetings as needed
rather than having fewer but longer meetings, and having realistic
expectations from the planning project.</p>

<a name="anchor11948"></a>


<h2>Always First Do &quot;Plan for a Plan&quot;</h2>

<p>Too often, planners jump into the planning process by reviewing
the organization's mission or then establishing a vision and goals
to achieve in the future. Instead, planners should always start
by doing a &quot;plan for a plan.&quot; When planner skip this
step, they too often produce a plan that is not relevant to the
organization, unrealistic to apply, and inflexible to the culture
and limitations of the organization.</p>

<h2>Strategic Analyses -- Analyzing External and Internal Environments</h2>

<p>(Many planners prefer to start strategic planning by clarifying
the mission, vision and/or values of the organization. Other planners
prefer to start by taking a wide look around the external environment
of the organization and also the inside of the organization, and
then clarifying/strategizing what the organization should do as
a result of what the planners find. If you prefer to address the
mission, vision and/or values next, then skip to those sections
later on below.)</p>

<p>A frequent complaint about strategic plans is that they are
merely &quot;to-do&quot; lists of what to accomplish over the
next few years. Or, others complain that strategic planning never
seems to come in handy when the organization is faced with having
to make a difficult, major decision. Or, other complain that strategic
planning really doesn't help the organization face the future.
These complaints arise because organizations fail to conduct a
thorough strategic analysis as part of their strategic planning
process. Instead, planners decide to plan only from what they
know now. This makes the planning process much less strategic
and a lot more guesswork. Strategic analysis is the heart of the
strategic planning process and should not be ignored.</p>

<a name="anchor146089"></a>
<h3>Taking a Wide Look Around the Outside
of the Organization to Identify Opportunities and Threats</h3>

<p>An external analysis usually includes looking at various trends,
including political, economic, societal, technological and ecological.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons that organizations do strategic
planning is to ensure that they remain sustainable -- that they
not only survive, but that they thrive well into the future. So
it's important to understand what makes an organization sustainable
-- it's not just getting enough money. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/sustainabledevelopment/index.htm"

<h4>Do a SWOT Analysis of Results of
Looking Outside and Inside the Organization?</h4>

<p>Now that you've identified opportunities (O) and threats (T)
and also strengths (S) and weaknesses (W), you could to do a SWOT
analysis in order to identify important priorities to address
and how to address them, i.e., identify strategic goals and methods/strategies
to achieve them. Note that the next section below, &quot;Other
Guidelines ...&quot;, also gives ideas about how analyze results
of your strategic analyses.</p>

<h3>Developing/Updating a Mission Statement</h3>

<p>(As mentioned above, many planners prefer to start strategic
planning by clarifying the mission, vision and/or values of the
organization. Other planners prefer to start by taking a wide
look around the external environment of the organization and also
the inside, and then clarifying/strategizing what the organization
should do as a result of what the planners find. If you prefer
first to do those analyses, then see the Strategic Analysis section
above.)</p>

<h2>Action Planning and Operational Planning (Objectives, Responsibilities
and Deadlines)</h2>

<p>Strategic planning can be exhilarating when coming up with
new visions and missions and values, talking about long-standing
issues in the workplace and coming up with new and exciting opportunities.
But without careful action planning -- and diligently ensuring
actions are carried out -- the plan ends up collecting dust on
a shelf. Many organizations develop action plans for the first
year of a multi-year strategic plan and refer to that action plan
as an &quot;operational plan.&quot;</p>

<h2>Writing and Communicating the Plan</h2>

<p>I've you've followed the guidelines, so far, throughout this
Library topic, then writing your plan will be fairly straightforward.
A frequent mistake at this point is not communicating the plan
to enough people, including external stakeholders. The following
link will be useful to you now.<br />

<h2>Implementing, Monitoring, Evaluating and Deviating from the
Plan -- and Managing Change</h2>

<a name="anchor97152"></a>
<h3>How Do We Ensure Implementation
of Our New Plan?</h3>

<p>A frequent complaint about the strategic planning process is
that it produces a document that ends up collecting dust on a
shelf -- the organization ignores the precious information depicted
in the document.</p>

<p>The following guidelines will help ensure that the plan is
implemented.<br />
(Note that reference to boards of directors is in regard to organizations
that are corporations.<br />
1. When conducting the planning process, involve the people who
will be responsible for implementing the plan. Use a cross-functional
team (representatives from each of the major organization&#146;s
products or service) to ensure the plan is realistic and collaborative.<br />
2. Ensure the plan is realistic. Continue asking planning participants
&#147;Is this realistic? Can you really do this?&#148;<br />
3. Organize the overall strategic plan into smaller action plans,
often including an action plan (or work plan) for each committee
on the board. <br />
4. In the overall planning document, specify who is doing what
and by when (action plans are often referenced in the implementation
section of the overall strategic plan). Some organizations may
elect to include the action plans in a separate document from
the strategic plan, which would include only the mission, vision,
values, key issues and goals, and strategies. This approach carries
some risk that the board will lose focus on the action plans.<br />
5. In an implementation section in the plan, specify and clarify
the plan&#146;s implementation roles and responsibilities. Be
sure to detail particularly the first 90 days of the implementation
of the plan. Build in regular reviews of status of the implementation
of the plan.<br />
6. Translate the strategic plan&#146;s actions into job descriptions
and personnel performance reviews.<br />
7. Communicate the role of follow-ups to the plan. If people know
the action plans will be regularly reviewed, implementers tend
to do their jobs before they&#146;re checked on.<br />
8. Be sure to document and distribute the plan, including inviting
review input from all.<br />
9. Be sure that one internal person has ultimate responsibility
that the plan is enacted in a timely fashion.<br />
10. The chief executive&#146;s support of the plan is a major
driver to the plan&#146;s implementation. Integrate the plan&#146;s
goals and objectives into the chief executive&#146;s performance
reviews.<br />
11. Place huge emphasis on feedback to the board&#146;s executive
committee from the planning participants.</p>

<p>Consider all or some of the following to ensure the plan is
implemented.<br />
12. Have designated rotating &#147;checkers&#148; to verify, e.g.,
every quarter, if each implementer completed their assigned tasks.<br />
13. Have pairs of people be responsible for tasks. Have each partner
commit to helping the other to finish the other&#146;s tasks on
time.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Implementation, Evaluating
Implementation -- and Deviating from Plan, If Necessary</h3>

<p>As stated several times throughout this library topics (and
in materials linked from it), too many strategic plans end up
collecting dust on a shelf. Monitoring and evaluating the planning
activities and status of implementation of the plan is -- for
many organizations -- as important as identifying strategic issues
and goals. One advantage of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure
that the organization is following the direction established during
strategic planning. That advantage is obvious. However, another
major advantage is that the management can learn a great deal
about the organization and how to manage it by continuing to monitor
and evaluate the planning activities and the status of the implementation
of the plan. Note that plans are guidelines. They aren't rules.

<h3>Changing the Plan As Necessary
During Implementation</h3>

<p>It's OK to deviate from a plan. But planners should understand
the reason for the deviations and update the plan to reflect the
new direction. <br />

<h3>Guidelines to Manage Organizational
Change While Implementing the Plan</h3>

significant changes within your organization, whether changes
to strategy, structure or policies. These should be done carefully.

<h3>Handy Tool to Guarantee Plans Are Implemented</h3>

<p>It's one thing to develop a plan. It's another to actually
implement the plan. Far too many plans sit untouched on shelves.
A low-cost, straightforward approach to share ongoing support
and accountabilities to implement a plan is to use peer coaching
groups. That approach is brought to you by Authenticity Consulting,
LLC -- the same company that brings you this Free Management Library.<br />
