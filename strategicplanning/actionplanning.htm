<p>(At this point in the strategic planning process, planners have usually already 
  completed all or most of the strategic analysis, including the environmental 
  scan, SWOT analysis, identifying strategic issues and goals. They've probably 
  already developed/updated the mission statement (and a vision statement and 
  values statement, if they choose to add these).</p>
<p>Action planning typically includes deciding who is going to do what and by 
  when and in what order for the organization to reach its strategic goals. The 
  design and implementation of the action planning depend on the nature and needs 
  of the organization.</p>
<h2><a name="one" id="one"></a>One of Biggest Problems in Strategic Planning: 
  Plan Isn't Implemented</h2>
<p>


At this point in planning, planners are sometimes fatigued from
completing the earlier phases of planning. Action planning may
seem detailed and tedious compared to earlier phases of strategic
planning which often seem creative in nature. Therefore, action
planning is too often ignored, leaving the results of earlier
stages of planning much as &#147;castles in the air&#148; -- useless
philosophical statements with no grounding in the day-to-day realities
of the organization. Meaningful stages of earlier planning become
utterly useless.</p>

<p>The organization's commitment to strategic planning is commensurate
to the extent that a) the organization completes action plans
to reach each strategic goal and b) includes numerous methods
for verifying and evaluating the actual extent of implementation
of the action plan.</p>

<h2><a name="work" id="work"></a>Developing Action Plans (or Work Plans)</h2>
<p>


1. Actions plans specify the actions needed to address each of
the top organizational issues and to reach each of the associated
goals, who will complete each action and according to what timeline.</p>

<p>2. Develop an overall, top-level action plan that depicts how
each strategic goal will be reached.</p>

<p>3. Develop an action plan for each major function in the organization,
e.g., marketing, development, finance, personnel, and for each
program/service, etc. These plans, in total, should depict how
the overall action plan will be implemented. In each action plan,
specify the relationship of the action plan to the organization's
overall, top-level action plan.</p>

<p>4. Ensure each manager (and, ideally each employee) has an
action plan that contributes to the overall. These plans, in total,
should depict how the action plans of the major functions will
be implemented. Again, specify the relationship of these action
plan to the organization's overall, top-level action plan.</p>

<p>5. The format of the action plan depends on the nature and
needs of the organization. The plan for the organization, each
major function, each manager and each employee, might specify:<br />
a) The goal(s) that are to be accomplished<br />
b) How each goal contributes to the organization's overall strategic
goals<br />
c) What specific results (or objectives) much be accomplished
that, in total, reach the goal of the organization<br />
d) How those results will be achieved<br />
e) When the results will be achieved (or timelines for each objective)</p>

<h2><a name="dev" id="dev"></a>Developing Objectives and Timelines</h2>
<p>


1. Objectives are specific, measurable results produced while
implementing strategies.</p>

<p>2. While identifying objectives, keep asking &#147;Are you
sure you can do this?&#148;</p>

<p>3. Integrate the current year&#146;s objectives as performance
criteria in each &#147;implementer&#146;s&#148; job description
and performance review.</p>

<p>4. Remember that objectives and their timelines are only guidelines,
not rules set in stone. They can be deviated from, but deviations
should be understood and explained.</p>

<p>5. Consider the following example format for action your plan.</p>

<p><table width="587" height="49" border="1" cellspacing="0" 
cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="20%">
<p align="center"><b>Strategic Goal</b></td>
    <td width="20%">
<p align="center"><b>Strategy</b></td>
    <td width="20%">
<p align="center"><b>Objective</b></td>
    <td width="20%">
<p align="center"><b>Responsibility</b></td>
    <td width="20%">
<p align="center"><b>Timeline</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top">
    1. (Goal #1)</td> 
    <td width="20%" valign="top">
    1.1 (first strategy to reach Goal #1)</td> 
    <td width="20%" valign="top">
    1.1.1 (first objective to reach while implementing Strategy #1.1)</td> 
    <td width="20%" valign="top">
    (who&#146;s going to accomplish that objective)</td> 
    <td width="20%" valign="top">
    (when the implementer is going to be accomplish that objective)</td>
  </tr> 
</table></p>
