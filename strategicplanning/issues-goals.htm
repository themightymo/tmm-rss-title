<h1>Basics of Identifying Strategic Issues and Goals</h1>

Facilitation</a>.</p>

<p>This activity is usually conducted as part of the overall strategic planning. 
  Therefore, the reader might best be served to first read the information in 
  the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic 
  Planning</a>. Strategic issues and goals are usually identified near the end 
  of the strategic analysis activity (which sometimes includes doing an environmental 
  scan and/or SWOT analysis.)</p>

<h2>Address Questions Such As:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What external changes could effect the organization?&#148;
  Consider, e.g., <br />
  - changing demographics of stakeholders, including number, values,
  resources, power, etc.; <br />
  - changing rules and regulations; expectations and resources
  from customers, vendors, etc.; <br />
  - expected shifts in needs for products and services; availability
  of leadership and staffing; and <br />
  - what other current or new organizations provide similar services?</li>
  <li>What are the opportunities we might have from this external
  situation?</li>
  <li>What are the threats that we might be facing from this external
  situation?</li>
  <li>What is the quality of our internal activities, e.g., Board
  operations, planning, marketing, products and services, staffing
  and finances?</li>
  <li>What are our weaknesses of the organization, based on the
  quality of our internal activities?</li>
  <li>What are our strengths, based on the quality of our internal
  activities?</li> 
  <li>Should we do a SWOT analysis (<u>S</u>trengths, <u>W</u>eaknesses,
  <u>O</u>pportunities and <u>T</u>hreats? -- see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm#anchor37202">SWOT
  analysis</a>) to strategize?</li>
  <li>Or, should we collect input from everyone now about what
  they see as strategic issues? (Assume you'll use this approach,
  rather than a SWOT for now.)</li>
  <li>Use a round-robin technique to collect and organize members&#146;
  input. (Issues and goals usually come from strengths to be build
  on, weaknesses to be strengthened opportunities to be taken,
  and threats to be avoided.)</li>
  <li>Visit with each issue, whether it&#146;s &#147;important&#148;
  or &#147;urgent.&#148; Often, issues seem very important when
  they're only urgent, for example, changing a flat tire is an
  urgent issue -- but you'd never put &quot;changing a tire&quot;
  in your strategic plan. Attend only to the important issues and
  not the urgent issues. Attend to the important issues and not
  the urgent issues.</li>
  <li>Facilitate to gain consensus on the top three to five issues.
  (Many issues are based on gut feeling or intuition, rather than
  on extensive external and internal assessments. Issues that are
  too narrow do not warrant planning and issues that are too broad
  will bog you down. Deal with issues that you can do something
  about. Be careful not to ignore current major issues in the interest
  of pursuing more creative and forward-looking goals. Many organizations
  have faltered because their planning focused too far down the
  road and they ended up falling over their feet.</li>
  <li>Write down the issues. Issues should be clearly articulated
  so that another outside of the organization can understand the
  description of the issue.</li>
  <li>For each issue, one at a time, identify goals that, when
  achieved, will address the issue. It might require several goals
  for each issue. If planners get stuck on identifying goals, then
  have them brainstorm what can be done (strategies) to address
  the issues, and don't think about specific goals for now. Once
  strategies have been suggested, then suggest some specific milestones
  that will be recognized along the way of implementing the strategies
  -- can call them goals. Don't worry about getting the perfect
  goals. You can refine them as you actually work to implement
  them.</li>
