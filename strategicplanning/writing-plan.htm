<h2><a name="write" id="write"></a>Writing the Strategic Plan</h2>
<p>


1. Have a small number of people write the first draft of the
plan. An outside facilitator (someone hired from outside of the
organization to facilitate the planning process) should not be
the one who writes the plan.</p>

<p>2. Don&#146;t worry about having every last detail in the first
draft.</p>

<p>3. The draft should be presented to the board of directors
(if applicable) and upper management for review and approval.
It's not unusual for the board and/or top management of large
organizations to provide major input primarily to the contents
in the body of the document, that is, the mission and vision and
values statements, and the goals and strategies. Employees and
other staff often provide the major input to the action planning
portion, including the objectives, responsibilities and timelines
for completion of objectives.</p>

<h2><a name="format" id="format"></a>Formatting of the Strategic Plan</h2>
<p>


Note that it's wise to distribute copies of the plan to major
stakeholders (investors/funders, trade associations, etc.). Therefore,
you should organize the format of the plan such that the body
of the plan can be sent outside of the organization and the appendices
can include the more confidential and detail-oriented documents
-- documents which also tend to change a lot. The format of the
plan should fit the culture and preferences of the organization.</p>

<h3>Consider the Following Sections</h3>
<p><i>(The following sections might be viewed as the &quot;body&quot; of the plan 
  document.)</i><br />
  1) Executive Summary -- This is written to the scope and level of content that 
  an &#147;outsider&#148; can read the summary and grasp the mission of the organization, 
  its overall major issues and goals, and key strategies to reach the goals <br />
  2) Authorization -- This page includes all of the necessary signatures from 
  the board of directors (if applicable) and other top management designating 
  that they approve the contents of, and support implementation of, the plan<br />
  3) Organizational Description -- This section describes, for example, the beginnings 
  and history of the organization, its major products and services, highlights 
  and accomplishments during the history of organization, etc. <br />
  4) Mission, Vision and Values Statements -- These statements describe the strategic 
  &quot;philosophy&quot; of the organization<br />
  5) Goals and Strategies -- Lists all of the major strategic goals and associated 
  strategies identified during the strategic planning process.</p>

<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p><i>(The appendices often include information that is somewhat confidential, 
  detail-oriented and/or tends to change a lot.)</i><br />
  A) Action Planning -- Specifies objectives, responsibilities and timelines for 
  completion of objectives<br />
  B) Description of Strategic Planning Process Used -- Describes the process used 
  to develop the plan, who was involved, the number of meetings, any major lessons 
  learned to improve planning the next time around, etc.<br />
  C) Strategic Analysis Data -- Includes information generated during the external 
  analysis (for example, environmental scan) and internal analysis (for example, 
  SWOT analysis), and includes listing of strategic issues identified during these 
  analyses.<br />
  D) Goals for Board and Chief Executive Officer -- Goals of the board and CEO 
  should be directly aligned with goals identified during strategic planning. 
  This appendix will list goals for the board and can include recommendations 
  for redesigning board committees to be associated with strategic goals. The 
  appendix also lists goals for the CEO goals -- these can be used (along with 
  the CEO job description) to form the basis for performance evaluations of the 
  CEO.<br />
  E) Budget Planning -- Depicts the resources and funding needed to obtain and 
  use the resources needed to achieve the strategic goals. Budgets are often depicted 
  for each year of the term of the strategic plan<br />
  F) Operating Plan -- Describes the major goals and activities to be accomplished 
  over the coming fiscal year.<br />
  G) Financial Reports -- Includes last year's budget (with estimated expenses 
  and the actual amounts spent), this year's current budget (again with estimated 
  amounts and actual amounts spent), a balance sheet (or in the case of nonprofits, 
  a statement of financial position), income statement (or in the case of nonprofit, 
  a statement of financial activities), etc. <br />
  H) Monitoring and Evaluation of Plan -- Include criteria for monitoring and 
  evaluation, and the responsibilities and frequencies of monitoring the implementation 
  of the plan<br />
  I) Communication of Plan -- Describe the actions that will be taken to communicate 
  the plan and/or portions of it, and to whom</p>

<h2><a name="comm" id="comm"></a>Communicating the Strategic Plan</h2>
<p>

Note that certain groups of stakeholders might get
complete copies of the plan, including appendices, while other
groups (usually outside of the organization) might receive only
the body of the plan without its appendices.<br />
1. Every board member and member of management should get a copy
of the plan.</p>

<p>2. Consider distributing all (or highlights from) the plan
to everyone in the organization. It's amazing how even the newest
staff member gains quick context, appreciation, and meaning from
review of the strategic plan.</p>

<p>3. Post your mission and vision and values statements on the
walls of your main offices. Consider giving each employee a card
with the statements (or highlights from them) on the card.</p>

<p>4. Publish portions of your plan in your regular newsletter,
and advertising and marketing materials (brochures, ads, etc.).</p>

<p>5. Train board members and employees on portions of the plan
during orientations.</p>

<p>6. Include portions of the plan in policies and procedures,
including the employee manual.</p>

<p>7. Consider copies of the plan for major stakeholders, for
example, funders/investors, trade associations, potential collaborators,
vendors/suppliers, etc.</p>
