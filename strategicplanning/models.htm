<h2><a name="many" id="many"></a>Many Approaches to Strategic Planning ... It 
  Depends </h2>
<p>There is no one perfect strategic planning model for each organization. The 
  approach, or model, for strategic planning depends on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of strategic planning, for example, if planning is meant to 
    add a new product or program, then the process will probably include market 
    research to verify the need, markets, pricing, etc., for the new product or 
    service. .</li>
  <li>Whether the organization has done planning before, for example, if the organization 
    has not done planning before, then extensive attention to mission, vision 
    and values statements is probably warranted.</li>
  <li>The culture of the organization, for example, some cultures might prefer 
    a &quot;linear&quot; approach from mission, vision, values, quantified goals, 
    strategies, action plans, financial analysis, etc. Other cultures might prefer 
    a more organic and unfolding approach, such as telling stories.</li>
  <li>Whether the environment of the organization is changing rapidly, for example, 
    if the environment is changing rapidly, then planning should probably be a 
    shorter term than for an organization who's environment is fairly stable.</li>
  <li>Whether the organization has had success in planning in the past, for example, 
    if an organization has done planning in the past, but planners do not believe 
    it was successful, then the organization should perhaps undertake a simple, 
    short-term planning process for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each organization ends up developing its own nature and model of strategic 
  planning, often by selecting a model and modifying it as they go along in developing 
  their own planning process. </p>
<p>The following models provide a range of alternatives from which organizations 
  might select an approach and begin to develop their own strategic planning process. 
  Note that an organization might choose to integrate the models, e.g., using 
  a scenario model to creatively identify strategic issues and goals, and then 
  an issues-based model to carefully strategize to address the issues and reach 
  the goals.</p>
<h2><a name="one" id="one"></a>Model One - Vision-Based or Goals-Based Strategic 
  Planning</h2>
<p>This is the most common model of strategic planning, although it's not suited 
  for every organization. This model includes developing a vision (usually quite 
  ambitious) about a future state and then works backwards to identify what goals 
  are needed to achieve that vision. It's ideal for organizations that do not 
  have a large number of current issues to address, have sufficient resources 
  to focus on an ambitious vision, and with external environments that are not 
  very rapidly changing -- and is best especially for organizations that have 
  been successful with this model before. The basic strategic planning process 
  includes:</p>
<p>1. <b>Identify your purpose (mission statement)</b> - This is the statement(s) 
  that describes why your organization exists, i.e., its basic purpose. The statement 
  should describe what client needs are intended to be met and with what services, 
  the type of communities are sometimes mentioned. The top-level management should 
  develop and agree on the mission statement. The statements will change somewhat 
  over the years.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Establish a vision statement</strong> - This statement describes 
  the future state of your customers/clients and your organization at some point 
  in the future. </p>

<p>3. <b>Select the goals your organization must reach if it is to effectively 
  work toward your mission and achieve your vision </b>- Goals are general statements 
  about what you need to accomplish to meet your purpose, or mission, and address 
  major issues facing the organization.</p>
<p>The vision and goals might be long-range, for example, for 3-5 years into the 
  future. </p>

<p>4. <b>Identify specific approaches (or strategies) that must be implemented 
  to reach each goal</b> - The strategies are often what change the most as the 
  organization eventually conducts more robust strategic planning, particularly 
  by more closely examining the external and internal environments of the organization. 
  Small organizations might not refer to strategies and, instead, go the next 
  step about action planning for each goal. </p>

<p>5. <b>Identify specific action plans to implement each strategy (or objectives 
  to achieve each goal) </b>- These are the specific activities or objectives 
  that each major function (for example, department, etc.) must undertake to ensure 
  it&#146;s effectively implementing each strategy (or achieving each goal). Objectives 
  should be clearly worded to the extent that people can assess if the objectives 
  have been met or not. Ideally, the top management develops specific committees 
  that each have a work plan, or set of objectives.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Compile the mission, vision, strategies and action plans into a 
  Strategic Plan document. </strong>Ensure that upper management approves the 
  Plan.</p>

<p>6. <b>Monitor implementation of the Plan and update the Plan as Needed </b>- 
  Planners regularly reflect on the extent to which the goals are being met and 
  whether action plans are being implemented. Perhaps the most important indicator 
  of success of the organization is positive feedback from the organization&#146;s 
  customers.</p>

<h2><a name="model" id="model"></a>Model Two - Issues-Based Planning</h2>
<p> This model works best for organizations that have very limited resources, 
  several current and major issues to address very soon, little success with achieving 
  ambitious goals, and/or or very little buy-in to strategic planning. In contrast 
  to vision-based planning that works from the future to the present, the issues-based 
  model works from the present to the future. An issues-based plan is usually 
  shorter in duration than a vision-based plan, e.g., might be even a one-year 
  plan. After an issues-based plan has been implemented and so its internal operations 
  are stronger, then the organization migth undertake the more ambitious vision-based 
  model. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Identify the current, major issues facing the organization. </strong>Write 
  down 3-5 major issues. <br />
  <br />
  2. <strong>Brainstorm ideas to address each major issue. </strong>It's not important 
  that the ideas be the perfect ideas -- it's important for now to identify at 
  least a reasonable approach to address each issue.</p>
<p>The issues and ideas are usually short-range, for example, for 9-12 months 
  in to the future.</p>
<p>3. <b>Compile the issues and ideas into a Strategic Plan document. </b>Ensure 
  that upper management approves the Plan.</p>
<p>4. <b>Monitor implementation of the Plan and update the Plan as Needed </b>- 
  Planners regularly reflect on the extent to which the goals are being met and 
  whether action plans are being implemented. Perhaps the most important indicator 
  of success of the organization is positive feedback from the organization&#146;s 
  customers.</p>
<h2><a name="three" id="three"></a>Model Three -- Alignment Model</h2>
<p>The overall purpose of the model is to ensure strong alignment among the organization&#146;s 
  mission and its resources to effectively operate the organization. This model 
  is useful for organizations that need to fine-tune strategies or find out why 
  they are not working. An organization might also choose this model if it is 
  experiencing a large number of issues around internal efficiencies. Overall 
  steps include:</p>
<p>1. The planning group outlines the organization&#146;s mission,
programs, resources, and needed support.</p>

<p>2. Identify what&#146;s working well and what needs adjustment.</p>

<p>3. Identify how these adjustments should be made.</p>

<p>4. Include the adjustments as strategies in the strategic plan.</p>

<h2><a name="four" id="four"></a>Model Four - Scenario Planning</h2>
<p> This approach might be used in conjunction with other models to ensure planners 
  truly undertake strategic thinking. The model may be useful, particularly in 
  identifying strategic issues and goals. Many people might not consider scenario 
  planning to be a planning model, and that it instead is a method to enhance 
  strategic thinking in any model of planning. </p>

<p>1. Select several external forces and imagine related changes
which might influence the organization, e.g., change in regulations,
demographic changes, etc. Scanning the newspaper for key headlines
often suggests potential changes that might effect the organization.</p>

<p>2. For each change in a force, discuss three different future
organizational scenarios (including best case, worst case, and
OK/reasonable case) which might arise with the organization as
a result of each change. Reviewing the worst-case scenario often
provokes strong motivation to change the organization.</p>

<p>3. Suggest what the organization might do, or potential strategies,
in each of the three scenarios to respond to each change.</p>

<p>4. Planners soon detect common considerations or strategies
that must be addressed to respond to possible external changes.</p>

<p>5. Select the most likely external changes to effect the organization,
e.g., over the next three to five years, and identify the most
reasonable strategies the organization can undertake to respond
to the change.</p>

<h2><a name="organic" id="organic"></a>Model Five - &#147;Organic&#148; (or Self-Organizing) 
  Planning</h2>
<p>
Traditional strategic planning processes are sometimes considered
&#147;mechanistic&#148; or &#147;linear,&#148; i.e., they&#146;re
rather general-to-specific or cause-and-effect in nature. For
example, the processes often begin by conducting a broad assessment
of the external and internal environments of the organization,
conducting a strategic analysis (&#147;SWOT&#148; analysis), narrowing
down to identifying and prioritizing issues, and then developing
specific strategies to address the specific issues.</p>

<p>Another view of planning is similar to the development of an
organism, i.e., an &#147;organic,&#148; self-organizing process.
Certain cultures, e.g., Native American Indians, might prefer
unfolding and naturalistic &#147;organic&#148; planning processes
more than the traditional mechanistic, linear processes. Self-organizing
requires continual reference to common values, dialoguing around
these values, and continued shared reflection around the systems
current processes. General steps include:</p>

<p>1. Clarify and articulate the organization&#146;s cultural
values. Use dialogue and story-boarding techniques.</p>

<p>2. Articulate the group&#146;s vision for the organization.
Use dialogue and story-boarding techniques.</p>

<p>3. On an ongoing basis, e.g., once every quarter, dialogue
about what processes are needed to arrive at the vision and what
the group is going to do now about those processes.</p>

<p>4. Continually remind yourself and others that this type of naturalistic planning 
  is never really &#147;over with,&#148; and that, rather, the group needs to 
  learn to conduct its own values clarification, dialogue/reflection, and process 
  updates.</p>

<p>5. Be very, very patient.</p>

<p>6. Focus on learning and less on method.</p>

<p>7. Ask the group to reflect on how the organization will portray
its strategic plans to stakeholders, etc., who often expect the
&#147;mechanistic, linear&#148; plan formats.</p>


<h2><a name="real" id="real"></a>Model Six -- Real-Time Planning</h2>
<p>Many experts assert that conventional strategic planning has become rather 
  out-dated because the world is changing much more rapidly than before, to the 
  extent that conventional (especially long-range) plans quickly become obsolete. 
  These experts might assert that planning be done continuously, or in &quot;real 
  time.&quot; The process might look like the following:
<p>1. Initial discussions to clarify mission, vision and values. Ideally, these 
  are documented, such that changes are easily recognized and communicated. 
<p>2. Discussions in, for example, Board and staff meeting that clarify current, 
  major priorities. It's important that these discussions be based not only on 
  people's current opinions, but that they also be based, as much as possible, 
  on verified impressions from accurate data, for example, from environmental 
  scans, market research, brainstorming or product/program evaluations. It's important 
  that the updated/changed priorities also be documented. 
<p>3. In a planning meeting (e.g., a Board meeting), planners might discuss the 
  external threats and opportunities facing an organization. In the next meeting, 
  e.g., a month later, they might discuss the internal strengths and weaknesses 
  of the organization. In the next meeting, they might discuss strategies to address 
  what they have found. The organizatioud would repeat this process, e.g., in 
  each Board meeting. 
<p>A challenge in this type of planning is that many investors and funders expect 
  to see &quot;stable&quot; documented strategic plans. Many might infer that 
  regular changes are the result of poor planning, rather than from a new type 
  of strategic planning.
