<h2>What is Strategic
Planning?</h2>


Simply put, strategic planning determines where an organization
is going over the next year or more and how it's going to get
there. Typically, the process is organization-wide, or focused
on a major function such as a division, department or other major
function. (The descriptions on this page assume that strategic
planning is focused on the organization.)</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor1435288"></a>
<h2>How to Get a
Feel for Strategic Planning -- There's No Perfect Way to Do It</h2>

Planning typically includes several major activities
or steps in the process. Different people often have different
names for these major activities. They might even conduct them
in a different order. Strategic planning often includes use of
several key terms. Different people might use apply different
definitions for these terms, as well.</p>

<p><i>Don't be concerned about finding the &quot;perfect way&quot;
to conduct strategic planning.</i> You'll soon notice that
each writer seems to have their own particularly interpretation
of the activities in strategic planning. However, as you read
the materials linked from the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic Planning</a> in this library, you'll begin to notice some information
that is common to most writers.</p>

<p>Read the basic description described below on this page. Then
review the various materials linked from the library in the topic
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic Planning</a>. Once you start
strategic planning, you'll soon find your own particular approach
to carrying out the process.</p>

<h2>One Way to Look
at Strategic Planning</h2>


One interpretation of the major activities in strategic planning
activities is that it includes:</p>

<h3>1. Strategic Analysis</h3>
This activity can include conducting some sort of scan, or review,
of the organization's environment (for example, of the political,
social, economic and technical environment). Planners carefully
consider various driving forces in the environment, for example,
increasing competition, changing demographics, etc. Planners also
look at the various strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
(an acronym for this activity is <b><i>SWOT</i></b>) regarding
the organization.</p>

<p>(Some people take this wide look around after they've identified
or updated their mission statement, vision statement, values statement,
etc. These statements are briefly described below. Other people
conduct the analysis before reviewing the statements.)</p>

<p>(Note that in the past, organizations usually referred to the
phrase &quot;<b><i>long-range planning</i></b>&quot;. More
recently, planners use the phrase &quot;strategic planning&quot;.
This new phrase is meant to capture the strategic (comprehensive,
thoughtful, well-placed) nature of this type of planning.)</p>

<h3>2. Setting Strategic Direction</h3>
Planners carefully come to conclusions about what the organization
must do as a result of the major issues and opportunities facing
the organization. These conclusions include what overall accomplishments
(or <b><i>strategic goals</i></b><i>)</i> the organization should
achieve, and the overall methods (or <b><i>strategies</i>)</b>
to achieve the accomplishments. Goals should be designed and worded
as much as possible to be specific, measurable, acceptable to
those working to achieve the goals, realistic, timely, extending
the capabilities of those working to achieve the goals, and rewarding
to them, as well. (An acronym for these criteria is &quot;SMARTER&quot;.)</p>

<p>At some point in the strategic planning process (sometimes
in the activity of setting the strategic direction), planners
usually identify or update what might be called the strategic
&quot;philosophy&quot;. This includes identifying or updating
the organization's mission, vision and/or values statements. <b><i>Mission
statements</i></b> are brief written descriptions of the purpose
of the organization. Mission statements vary in nature from very
brief to quite comprehensive, and including having a specific
purpose statement that is part of the overall mission statement.
Many people consider the values statement and vision statement
to be part of the mission statement. New businesses (for-profit
or nonprofit) often work with a state agency to formally register
their new business, for example, as a corporation, association,
etc. This registration usually includes declaring a mission statement
in their charter (or constitution, articles of incorporation,
etc.).</p>

<p>It seems that vision and values statements are increasingly
used. <b><i>Vision statements</i></b> are usually a compelling
description of how the organization will or should operate at
some point in the future and of how customers or clients are benefiting
from the organization's products and services. <b><i>Values statements</i></b>
list the overall priorities in how the organization will operate.
Some people focus the values statement on moral values. Moral
values are values that suggest overall priorities in how people
ought to act in the world, for example, integrity, honesty, respect,
etc. Other people include operational values which suggest overall
priorities for the organization, for example, to expand marketshare,
increase efficiency, etc. (Some people would claim that these
operational values are really strategic goals. Don't get hung
up on wording for now.)</p>

<h3>3. Action Planning</h3>
<i>Action planning</i></b> is carefully laying out how the strategic
goals will be accomplished. Action planning often includes specifying
<b><i>objectives</i></b>, or specific results, with each strategic
goal. Therefore, reaching a strategic goal typically involves
accomplishing a set of objectives along the way -- in that sense,
an objective is still a goal, but on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Often, each objective is associated with a <b><i>tactic,</i></b> which
is one of the methods needed to reach an objective. Therefore,
implementing a strategy typically involves implementing a set
of tactics along the way -- in that sense, a tactic is still a
strategy, but on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Action planning also includes specifying <b><i>responsibilities</i></b>
and <b><i>timelines</i></b> with each objective, or who needs
to do what and by when. It should also include methods to <b><i>monitor</i></b>
and <b><i>evaluate</i></b> the plan, which includes knowing how
the organization will know who has done what and by when.</p>

<p>It's common to develop an <b><i>annual plan</i></b> (sometimes
called the <b><i>operational plan</i></b> or <b><i>management
plan</i></b>), which includes the strategic goals, strategies,
objectives, responsibilities and timelines that should be done
in the coming year. Often, organizations will develop plans for
each major function, division department, etc., and call these
<b><i>work plans.</i></b></p>

<p>Usually, <b><i>budgets</i></b> are included in the strategic
and annual plan, and with work plans. Budgets specify the money
needed for the resources that are necessary to implement the annual
plan. Budgets also depict how the money will be spent, for example,
for human resources, equipment, materials, etc.</p>

<p>(Note there are several different kinds of budgets. Operating
budgets are usually budgets associated with major activities over
the coming year. Project budgets are associated with major projects,
for example, constructing a building, developing a new program
or product line, etc. Cash budgets depict where cash will be spent
over some near term, for example, over the next three months (this
is very useful in order to know if you can afford bills that must
be paid soon. Capital budgets are associated with operating some
major asset, for example, a building, automobiles, furniture,
computers, etc.</p>
