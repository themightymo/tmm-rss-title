<h2>Developing a Mission Statement</h2>

<p>1. Basically, the mission statement describes the overall purpose
of the organization.<br />
2. If the organization elects to develop a vision statement before
developing the mission statement, ask &#147;Why does the image,
the vision exist -- what is its purpose?&#148; This purpose is
often the same as the mission.<br />
3. Developing a mission statement can be quick culture-specific,
i.e., participants may use methods ranging from highly analytical
and rational to highly creative and divergent, e.g., focused discussions,
divergent experiences around daydreams, sharing stories, etc.
Therefore, visit with the participants how they might like to
arrive at description of their organizational mission.<br />
4. When wording the mission statement, consider the organization's
products, services, markets, values, and concern for public image,
and maybe priorities of activities for survival.<br />
5. Consider any changes that may be needed in wording of the mission
statement because of any new suggested strategies during a recent
strategic planning process.<br />
6. Ensure that wording of the mission is to the extent that management
and employees can infer some order of priorities in how products
and services are delivered.<br />
7. When refining the mission, a useful exercise is to add or delete
a word from the mission to realize the change in scope of the
mission statement and assess how concise is its wording.<br />
8. Does the mission statement include sufficient description that
the statement clearly separates the mission of the organization
from other organizations?</p>

<h2>Developing a Vision Statement</h2>

<p>1. The vision statement includes vivid description of the organization
as it effectively carries out its operations. <br />
2. Developing a vision statement can be quick culture-specific,
i.e., participants may use methods ranging from highly analytical
and rational to highly creative and divergent, e.g., focused discussions,
divergent experiences around daydreams, sharing stories, etc.
Therefore, visit with the participants how they might like to
arrive at description of their organizational vision.<br />
3. Developing the vision can be the most enjoyable part of planning,
but the part where time easily gets away from you.<br />
4. Note that originally, the vision was a compelling description
of the state and function of the organization once it had implemented
the strategic plan, i.e., a very attractive image toward which
the organization was attracted and guided by the strategic plan.
Recently, the vision has become more of a motivational tool, too
often including highly idealistic phrasing and activities which
the organization cannot realistically aspire.</p>

<h2>Developing a Values Statement</h2>

<p>1. Values represent the core priorities in the organization&#146;s
culture, including what drives members&#146; priorities and how
they truly act in the organization, etc. Values are increasingly
important in strategic planning. They often drive the intent and
direction for &#147;organic&#148; planners.<br />
2. Developing a values statement can be quick culture-specific,
i.e., participants may use methods ranging from highly analytical
and rational to highly creative and divergent, e.g., focused discussions,
divergent experiences around daydreams, sharing stories, etc.
Therefore, visit with the participants how they might like to
arrive at description of their organizational values.<br />
3. Establish four to six core values from which the organization
would like to operate. Consider values of customers, shareholders,
employees and the community.<br />
4. Notice any differences between the organization&#146;s preferred
values and its true values (the values actually reflected by members&#146;
behaviors in the organization). Record each preferred value on
a flash card, then have each member &#147;rank&#148; the values
with 1, 2, or 3 in terms of the priority needed by the organization
with 3 indicating the value is very important to the organization
and 1 is least important. Then go through the cards again to rank
how people think the values are actually being enacted in the
organization with 3 indicating the values are fully enacted and
1 indicating the value is hardly reflected at all. Then address
discrepancies where a value is highly preferred (ranked with a
3), but hardly enacted (ranked with a 1). <br />
5. Incorporate into the strategic plan, actions to align actual
behavior with preferred behaviors.<br />
