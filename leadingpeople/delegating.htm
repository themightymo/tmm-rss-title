<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Delegating? How Is It Different than 
  Work Directing?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, MBA, 
PhD</a></p>
<p>Delegating is a critical skill for supervisors at any level. Delegating involves 
  working with an employee to establish goals, granting them sufficient authority 
  and responsibility to achieve the goals, often giving them 1) substantial freedom 
  in deciding how the goals will be achieved, 2) remaining available as a resource 
  to help them achieve the goals, 3) assessing the quality of their effort and 
  attainment of the goals, 4) and addressing performance issues and/or rewarding 
  their performance. Ultimately, the supervisor retains responsibility for the 
  attainment of the goals, but chooses to achieve the goals by delegating to someone 
  else.</p>
<p>Delegating is different than work directing. Work directing is telling someone 
  what to do and how to do it. There usually is much less freedom as to how the 
  employee does the task, and many times is much less ownership, participation 
  and learning on the part of the employee, as well. </p>
<p>Delegation can sometimes be a major challenge for new supervisors to learn 
  because they are concerned about giving up control or struggling to have confidence 
  in the abilities of others. Supervisors that can effectively delegate can free 
  up a great deal of their own time, help their direct reports to cultivate expertise 
  in learning, and can develop their own leadership skills -- skills that are 
  critical for problem solving, goal attainment and learning.</p>
<h2><a name="success" id="success"></a>How to Delegate for Growth and Performance 
  of Your Employees</h2>
<p>Thomas R. Horton, in Delegation and Team Building: No Solo Acts Please (Management 
  Review, September 1992, pp. 58-61) suggests the following general steps to accomplish 
  delegation: </p>
<h3>1. Delegate the whole task to one person. </h3>
<p>This gives the person complete responsibility for doing the task and increases 
  the person&#8217;s motivation to do the task, as well. It also provides more 
  focus for the supervisor when working with the person to understand that the 
  desired results should look like. </p>
<h3>2. Select the right person to delegate to.</h3>
<p>Assess the skills and capabilities of the person to be sure that individual 
  can actually accomplish the task. Does he/she have the knowledge, skills and 
  abilities to do the task? If not, the person might need training. Or, perhaps 
  the task should be delegated to someone else. </p>
<h3>3. Clearly specify your preferred results. </h3>
<p>Provide information on what the results should look like, why those results 
  are desired, when the results should be accomplished, who else might help the 
  person, and what resources the person has to work with. You might leave the 
  &#8220;how to accomplish the task&#8221; to be decided by the person. It is 
  often best to write this information down.</p>
<h3>4. Delegate responsibility and authority &#8211; assign the task, not the 
  method to accomplish it. </h3>
<p>Let the person complete the task in the manner that he/she chooses, as long 
  as the desired results are likely to be what the supervisor specifies. Let the 
  person have strong input as to the completion date of the project. Note that 
  you may not even know how to complete the task yourself &#8211; this is often 
  the case with higher levels of management. Make sure that others in the organization 
  understand that this person has both the responsibility and the authority to 
  complete the task. </p>
<h3>5. Ask the person to summarize back to you, a description of the results you 
  prefer.</h3>
<p>Explain that you are requesting the summary to be sure you effectively described 
  the results to the person, not necessarily to be sure that the person heard 
  you. That explanation helps the person to not feel as if he/she is somehow being 
  treated as if he/she is untrustworthy. </p>
<h3>6. Get ongoing non-intrusive feedback about progress on the project. </h3>
<p>This is a good reason to continue to get weekly, written status reports from 
  the person. Reports should describe what he/she did last week, plans to do next 
  week, and any potential issues that might arise. Regular meetings with the person 
  provide feedback, as well.</p>
<h3>8. Maintain open lines of communication. </h3>
<p>Do not hover over the person to monitor his/her performance, but do sense what 
  he/she is doing and do support the person&#8217;s checking in with you while 
  doing the task.</p>
<h3>9. If you are not satisfied with the progress, do not do the task yourself! 
</h3>
<p>Continue to work with the person to ensure that he/she perceives that the task 
  is his/her responsibility. Look for the cause of your dissatisfaction. For example, 
  is it lack of communication, training, resources or commitment of the person? 
</p>
<h3>10. Evaluate and reward the person&#8217;s performance. </h3>
<p>Evaluate achievement of desired results more than the methods used by the person. 
  Address insufficient performance and reward successes. </p>
