<h1>UNDERSTANDING COACHING</h1>

<a name="anchor531934"></a>
<h2>What is Coaching? How Does it Compare
to Other Fields or Professions?</h2>

<p>The field of <b>personal and professional coaching</b> has grown rapidly in 
  the past 15 years and, as with most fields and professions that experience this 
  kind of growth, there are many different perspectives on coaching. Here's a 
  definition that perhaps most people would agree with. (There are more perspectives 
  provided in the next section, immediately below.)</p>

<p>Coaching involves working in a partnership between coach and
client(s) to provide structure, guidance and support for clients
to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a complete look at their current state, including their
  assumptions and perceptions about their work, themselves and/or
  others;</li>
  <li>Set relevant and realistic goals for themselves, based on
  their own nature and needs;</li>
  <li>Take relevant and realistic actions toward reaching their
  goals; and</li>
  <li>Learn by continuing to reflect on their actions and sharing
  feedback with others along the way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Coaching can be especially useful to help individuals, groups
and organizations to address complex problems and/or achieve significant
goals and to do so in a highly individualized fashion, while learning
at the same time.</p>

<p>Many people believe that coaching is different than <b>training</b>
and might describe training as an expert convey certain subject
matter to a student in order for the student to do a current task
more effectively. Those people might add that training isn't as
much of a partnership as a coaching relationship. Many might also
believe that coaching is different than <b>consulting</b> and
might describe consulting as an expert helping another person,
team or organization to solve a problem. Others might assert that
a good consultant would use skills in training and coaching, depending
on the needs of the client.</p>

<p>Many people assert that coaching is a <b>profession,</b> while
others assert that it is a <b>field,</b> that is, that coaching
has not yet accomplished a standardized approach, code of ethics
and credibility to be a profession. This topic in the Library
alternatively refers to coaching as a profession and a field.</p>

<h2>General Framework of a Coaching
Program</h2>

<p>There is no standardized approach to a coaching program that
all practitioners agree on, much like there is in medicine where
standardized procedures are used for certain maladies. Rather,
each coach focuses on a particular type of, and approach to, coaching
that suits his/her nature and interests, and applies that approach
to the types of clients that most closely matches the coach's
passions, interests and capabilities. However, the reader can
get an impression of a general framework that seems common to
the approaches of many coaches.</p>

<p>How the framework is implemented depends on the coach's training
and any particular model or school followed by the coach. Also,
there has been a dramatic increase in the number of coaches and,
consequently, increasing competition among them. One of the ways
that coaches can differentiate each other is by how they customize
their coach process to seem even more powerful and unique. The
framework seems to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forming a relationship with the potential client, including
  assessing if the client is really ready for coaching, orienting
  the client to personal and professional coaching, and clarifying
  how both the coach and client prefer to work together.</li>
  <li>Establishing a mutual agreement or coaching contract, including
  about the roles of the coach and client, ground rules for working
  together, frequency of meetings, confidentiality, etc.</li>
  <li>Developing client-centered goals to be achieved during the
  coaching project, the goals of which depend very much on whether
  the coaching is performance- or well-being-oriented.</li>
  <li>A series of face-to-face and/or phone-based meetings with
  the coach and client, including ongoing questions, affirmations,
  accountabilities, etc., to identify relevant and realistic actions
  the client can take to achieve the goals and learn at the same
  time.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the coaching, both during and shortly after the
  project, which is made easier if the coaching was based on mutually
  agreed goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, it's likely that many coaches would have many opinions
about the above rather simplified description The following links
are to resources that describe a similar framework.</p>

<h2>Coaching Conversations and Laser
Coaching</h2>

<a name="anchor2978188"></a>
<h3>Coaching Conversations</h3>

<p>In contrast to a coaching program, which includes the above
framework, coaching can be done in a one-time conversation. The
conversation might include a small sampling of the type of support
that a coach would give in each of the meetings in a coaching
program. One of the hallmarks of coaching is the use of questions.
(It's important to acknowledge that the primary use of questions
is not unique to coaching; consider, for example, <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/action-learning.htm">Action
Learning</a> (developed in the 1930s or self-directed <a class="textlink" href="http://pandc.ca/?cat=carl_rogers&amp;page=rogerian_therapy">Rogerian
Therapy</a> heralded by Carl Rogers.) Here's an example of the
difference between a coaching conversation and a common chatty
conversation, when trying to help someone.<br />

<a name="anchor2978808"></a>
<h3>Laser Coaching</h3>

<p>Laser coaching involves one or a few coaching sessions to address
an urgent and/or very specific issue. It also can be used to demonstrate
the coaching process to a potential client. It's also useful for
very busy people who are reluctant to commit to a long-term program.

<p>A coaching culture is where many people in the workplace instinctively
coach in their communications with each other -- they deeply listen
and understand each other, generate relevant and realistic actions
to make progress on current priorities -- and learn at the same
time.</p>

<h3>Are You Ready for Coaching?</h3>

<p>You might have realized some benefits that you might gain from
coaching. That's not enough. You also need to be ready to work
with someone in a relationship where the other person (the coach)
is there to help you -- you need to be ready to accept that help.
Here are some quick assessments to help you think about whether
you're ready for coaching.</p>

<h3>What Does Coaching Cost? How Long
Does Coaching Take?</h3>

<p>This is a little like asking &quot;How much does a car cost?&quot;
because the cost and duration of coaching depend on what you want
to accomplish by using a coach and also on your nature when being
involved with a coach to meet your needs. However, the following
links are to a variety of types of coaches and perhaps it'll be
useful to scan their information to get a sense for fees, duration
and even how they work with clients. (We are not endorsing the

<a name="anchor2493882"></a>
<h2>Two Broad Categories of Coaching</h2>

<a name="anchor15103"></a>
<h3>Performance Coaching</h3>

<p>Performance coaching aims to enhance the performance of an
individual, team, project or organization, especially to establish
and achieve desired goals, whether they be goals for individual,
team, project or organizational development. The very popular
business coaching is usually a form of performance coaching. Performance
coaches are often -- but not exclusively -- hired by organizations,
rather than by individuals.</p>

<h3>Well-Being Coaching</h3>

<p>Well-being, or being coaching, aims to enhance the quality
of life for an individual, for example, to support the individual
to accomplish more personal or professional development, such
as enhanced health, meaning and satisfaction in his/her life.
The very popular life coaching is usually a form of well-being
coaching. Well-being coaches are often -- but not exclusively
-- hired by individuals, rather than by an organizations.</p>

<h2>Domains of Coaching</h2>

<a name="anchor2784167"></a>
<h3>Self-Coaching</h3>

<p>Long-term change, whether in your career, work or organization,
usually begins with yourself, so self-coaching is an extremely
important capability. Self-coaching can be done for yourself at
any time.</p>

<h3>One-On-One Coaching</h3>

<p>One-on-one coaching is perhaps the most well-known form of
coaching and is what most people think of, when they think of
coaching. The process and manner in which this form of coaching
is done depends very much on the particular coaching model, training
and nature of the coach. An important topic is how coaching compares
to therapy (see <a class="textlink" href="#anchor531934">What is Coaching?</a>).</p>

<a name="anchor2786400"></a>
<h3>Peer Coaching</h3>

<p>Peer coaching is when the participants are equal in their commitment
to helping each other -- they don't have to be peers in responsibility
or expertise. Peer coaching is increasingly popular because it
can be done spontaneously when needed and is low-cost because
coaching experts typically are not being paid for services.</p>

<h3>Group Coaching</h3>

<p>There are various forms of group coaching. For example, a coach
can coach each member one at a time or support members to coach
each other (a peer coaching group). Action Learning is a very
popular form of group coaching and is used by most Fortune 1000
companies in the US, as well as being very popular in Europe.
Many people would consider team building to be team coaching.</p>

<h3>Organizational Coaching</h3>

<p>Organizational coaching aims to enhance the performance of
a unit in the organization (a department or process) or the entire
organization. This type of coaching gets best results when its
goals are closely aligned with the business goals of the unit
or organization.</p>

<h2>Some Common Types of Coaching
and Virtual Coaching</h2>

<p>There are numerous types of coaching and the number seems to
increase with each type of work, interest or challenge that people
experience. In this section are some of the most common types.
For example, there's business coaches, creativity coaches, career
coaches, executive coaches, health and wellness coaches, financial
coaches, life coaches, leadership coaches, marketing coaches,
relationship coaches, sales coaches, small business coaches, spiritual
coaches, team coaches, work-life coaches ... and the list goes
on and on. Coaching is so popular, and there are so many types
of coaching, and the rate of those entering coaching is so high
-- that there's a growing industry in training coaches and getting
business for coaches. Here's an overview of a few of the most
common types of coaches.</p>

<a name="anchor759679"></a>
<h3>Business Coaching</h3>

<p>A business coach helps business owners or members of the organization
to improve the business by using the philosophies, models and
tools of coaching. The business coach also might impart knowledge
about various functions of business, for example, planning, marketing
and finances (many coaches might argue that coaching does not
involve imparting expert knowledge, but that depends on the coach).
Some people might consider a <a class="textlink" href="#anchor15617">leadership
and executive coach</a> to be a business coach because that type
of coaching usually occurs within the context of a business.</p>

<h3>Career Coaching</h3>

<p>Career coaches help individuals to discover what they want
to do as a vocation, plan their careers, increase job satisfaction,
and sometimes to make a career transition, or even to advance
in their own careers.</p>

<h2>Some Examples of Coaching Models</h2>

<p>A coaching model is a framework that concisely depicts the
concepts and approach of the approach to coaching. There are many
models, and it's best for a coach to know more than one. Here
are some examples. The purpose of this listing is not to suggest
which models are best, but rather to give the reader a sense of
what a coaching model is. (Some people refer to &quot;methods,&quot;
rather than models.)</p>
