<h2>Descriptions of Mentoring</h2>
<p>There are many perspectives on the definition of mentoring, especially since 
  the relatively recent popularity of personal and professional <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm"
class="textlink">coaching</a>. Traditionally, mentoring might have been described 
  as the activities conducted by a person (the mentor) for another person (the 
  mentee) in order to help that other person to do a job more effectively and/or 
  progress in his or her career. The mentor was probably someone who had &quot;been 
  there, done that&quot; before. A mentor might use a variety of approaches, for 
  example, coaching, training and counseling. Today, there seems to be much ongoing 
  discussion and debate about the definitions and differences regarding coaching 
  and mentoring -- so you might also see the topic of <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm"

<h2><a name="ripe" id="ripe"></a>Mentoring: Ripe for Training</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/training-and-development/more-about-jack-shaw/" target="_blank">Jack 
  Shaw</a></p>
<p>Today mentors can and should provide expertise to prot&eacute;g&eacute;s (males) 
  or prot&eacute;g&eacute;es (females)&#8211;essentially less experienced individuals 
  to help them advance their careers, enhance their education, and build their 
  networks. While mentoring is an important aspect to leadership training, it 
  does not hold to a typical training environment or process; however, its tradition 
  has existed even longer than traditional training.</p>
<p>Wikipedia always comes to the rescue when you need immediate clarification 
  and not too much depth. It describes &#8220;mentoring&#8221; as a process that 
  always involves communication and is relationship based, but its precise definition 
  is elusive. There are two basic types of mentoring involving the training and 
  development process that we are concerned with in this forum:</p>
<ol>
  <li> the new-hire mentor. In this case, a more experienced person, not necessarily 
    one of the people high up in the company hierarchy but high enough &#8220;sponsors&#8221; 
    a new employee, giving them a polite tour of the corporate culture and then 
    there is</li>
  <li>the high-potential mentorship. Usually, when we think of mentoring, we think 
    of this kind&#8211;where especially selected employees are offered the opportunity 
    to develop a relationship with a senior leader.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new-hire mentor, as a mid-level employee, has nothing to lose and everything 
  to gain if he treats his own mentee to real training, and guides him or her 
  in the same way as the higher-level mentor; and his mentee would be a fool not 
  to accept it.</p>
<p>Both fit Wikipedia&#8217;s general definition: &#8220;Mentoring is a process 
  for the informal transmission of knowledge, social capital, and the psychosocial 
  support perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career, or professional 
  development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face 
  and during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to 
  have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience (the mentor) and a person 
  who is perceived to have less (the prot&eacute;g&eacute;).&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, can you train mentors and mentees to maximize the benefit and miss 
  the formality imposed by training?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s possible, but there has to be some structure&#8211;points 
  that focus and provide opportunities for mentees to learn important points of 
  interpersonal and public communication, problem-solving/leadership techniques, 
  company technical expertise and time management.</p>
<p>The only difference here and regular training is that the mentor is the trainer. 
  Once the mentor is aware of the need for this focus, most leaders/senior management 
  understand the need for training, and some would even welcome some structure 
  to a system that is still sorting itself out.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: a mentor with a plan&#8211;that&#8217;s training. The 
  new-hire mentor, as a mid-level employee, has nothing to lose and everything 
  to gain if he treats his own mentee to real training, and guides him or her 
  in the same way as the higher-level mentor; and his mentee would be a fool not 
  to accept it. In the case of a high-potential mentorship, the bigger problem 
  may actually be the trainee, the prot&eacute;g&eacute; or prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&#8211;better 
  known as the mentee who feels entitled to special treatment.</p>
<p>...it is important to note that Tom Wolfe's novel, The Right Stuff, is not 
  about those men who do have &quot;the right stuff&quot;...but rather what is 
  perceived by the public as &quot;the right stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>In this situation, we simply can&#8217;t train for the mentee position; someone 
  has to be anointed&#8211;which, by the way, is not intended to be a negative 
  sense. By virtue of being in that prime position, we may have someone who will 
  only take direction from his or her mentor. That is why it is the mentor that 
  must &#8220;do&#8221; the training.</p>
<p>To be one of the &#8220;anointed ones,&#8221; someone has to be noticed&#8211;having 
  those qualities perceived by the company or its leaders as &#8220;the right 
  stuff&#8221; to be a leader of the future. That being said, it is important 
  to note that Tom Wolfe&#8217;s novel, The Right Stuff, about the early space 
  program is not about those men who do, in fact, have &#8220;the right stuff&#8221; 
  defined by what is needed to fly a rocket into space, but rather what is perceived 
  by the public as &#8220;the right stuff.&#8221; We know now that the Mercury 
  astronauts were not selected for their ability to fly jets, but rather their 
  reputation, and physical ability to take the rigors of space. Monkeys and dogs 
  did sit in the same place and perform the same functions.</p>
<p>Unlike Wolfe&#8217;s message, which was not one of promise or fulfillment, 
  the mentor program of today&#8211;just like the mentor program of days long 
  past&#8211;still strive to select the very best and make it work. No one will 
  argue the importance of such a program to the retention of key personnel and 
  corporate knowledge.</p>
<p>A mentor will sometimes see himself or herself in an employee and decide this 
  person with their guidance and wisdom can one day run the company. To make the 
  mentoring process work, there has to be a deliberate effort to mold and shape 
  an individual. Shadowing alone is not enough. Training mentors to train their 
  mentees may be one way. Mentors who take the job seriously stand to do great 
  things for a company&#8217;s future and much for their own legacy.</p>
<p>Mentoring in Europe has existed since at least Ancient Greek times. It&#8217;s 
  really only since the 1970s that mentorism has spread in the United States, 
  mainly in leadership training contexts. It has been described as &#8220;an innovation 
  in American management.&#8221; If done well, the mentoring process will indeed 
  serve the individual by providing the necessary exposure to the reality, the 
  best training an employee can have, i.e., the experiential training needed to 
  do the job.<br />
