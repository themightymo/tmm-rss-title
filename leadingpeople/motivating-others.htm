<h2>Understanding Motivation</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>A major function of leaders is to support the motivation of other individuals 
  and groups. (There is debate as to whether a person can motivate another versus 
  whether a person can only support another to motivate themselves.) There are 
  approaches to motivating people that are destructive, for example, fear and 
  intimidation. While these approaches can seem very effective in promptly motivating 
  people, the approaches are hurtful, and in addition, they usually only motivate 
  for the short-term. There are also approaches that are constructive, for example, 
  effective delegation and coaching. These constructive approaches can be very 
  effective in motivating others and for long periods of time. Different people 
  can have quite different motivators, for example, by more money, more recognition, 
  time off from work, promotions, opportunities for learning, or opportunities 
  for socializing and relationships. Therefore, when attempting to help motivate 
  people, it's important to identify what motivates each of them. Ultimately, 
  though, long-term motivation comes from people motivating themselves.</p>

<h2>Clearing Up Common Myths About Employee Motivation</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>The topic of motivating employees is extremely important to managers and supervisors. 
  Despite the important of the topic, several myths persist -- especially among 
  new managers and supervisors. Before looking at what management can do to support 
  the motivation of employees, it's important first to clear up these common myths.</p>
<h3>1. <b>Myth #1 --</b> <b>&quot;I can motivate people&quot;</b></h3>
<p>Not really -- they have to motivate themselves. You can't motivate people anymore 
  than you can empower them. Employees have to motivate and empower themselves. 
  However, you can set up an environment where they best motivate and empower 
  themselves. The key is knowing how to set up the environment for each of your 
  employees.</p>
<h3>2. <b>Myth #2 -- &quot;Money is a good motivator&quot;</b></h3>
<p>Not really. Certain things like money, a nice office and job security can help 
  people from becoming less motivated, but they usually don't help people to become 
  more motivated. A key goal is to understand the motivations of each of your 
  employees.</p>
<h3>3. <b>Myth #3 -- &quot;Fear is a damn good motivator&quot;</b></h3>
<p>Fear is a great motivator -- for a very short time. That's why a lot of yelling 
  from the boss won't seem to &quot;light a spark under employees&quot; for a 
  very long time.</p>
<h3>4. <b>Myth #4 -- &quot;I know what motivates me, so I know what motivates 
  my employees&quot;</b></h3>
<p>Not really. Different people are motivated by different things. I may be greatly 
  motivated by earning time away from my job to spend more time my family. You 
  might be motivated much more by recognition of a job well done. People are not 
  motivated by the same things. Again, a key goal is to understand what motivates 
  each of your employees.</p>
<h3>5. <b>Myth #5 -- &quot;Increased job satisfaction means increased job performance&quot;</b></h3>
<p>Research shows this isn't necessarily true at all. Increased job satisfaction 
  does not necessarily mean increased job performance. If the goals of the organization 
  are not aligned with the goals of employees, then employees aren't effectively 
  working toward the mission of the organization.</p>
<p>6. <b>Myth #6 -- &quot;I can't comprehend employee motivation -- it's a science&quot;</b><br />
  Nah. Not true. There are some very basic steps you can take that will go a long 
  way toward supporting your employees to motivate themselves toward increased 
  performance in their jobs. (More about these steps is provided later on in this 
  article.)</p>

<h2>Basic Principles to Remember About Motivation</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<h3>1. <b>Motivating employees starts with motivating yourself</b></h3>
<p>It's amazing how, if you hate your job, it seems like everyone else does, too. 
  If you are very stressed out, it seems like everyone else is, too. Enthusiasm 
  is contagious. If you're enthusiastic about your job, it's much easier for others 
  to be, too. Also, if you're doing a good job of taking care of yourself and 
  your own job, you'll have much clearer perspective on how others are doing in 
  theirs.</p>
<p>A great place to start learning about motivation is to start understanding 
  your own motivations. The key to helping to motivate your employees is to understand 
  what motivates them. So what motivates you? Consider, for example, time with 
  family, recognition, a job well done, service, learning, etc. How is your job 
  configured to support your own motivations? What can you do to better motivate 
  yourself?</p>
<h3>2. <b>Always work to align goals of the organization with goals of employees</b></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, employees can be all fired up about their work and be working 
  very hard. However, if the results of their work don't contribute to the goals 
  of the organization, then the organization is not any better off than if the 
  employees were sitting on their hands -- maybe worse off! Therefore, it's critical 
  that managers and supervisors know what they want from their employees. These 
  preferences should be worded in terms of goals for the organization. Identifying 
  the goals for the organization is usually done during strategic planning. Whatever 
  steps you take to support the motivation of your employees (various steps are 
  suggested below), ensure that employees have strong input to identifying their 
  goals and that these goals are aligned with goals of the organization. (Goals 
  should be worded to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;. More about this later on below.)</p>
<h3>3. <b>Key to supporting the motivation of your employees is understanding 
  what motivates each of them</b></h3>
<p>Each person is motivated by different things. Whatever steps you take to support 
  the motivation of your employees, they should first include finding out what 
  it is that really motivates each of your employees. You can find this out by 
  asking them, listening to them and observing them. (More about this later on 
  below.)</p>
<h3>4. <b>Recognize that supporting employee motivation is a process, not a task</b></h3>
<p>Organizations change all the time, as do people. Indeed, it is an ongoing process 
  to sustain an environment where each employee can strongly motivate themselves. 
  If you look at sustaining employee motivation as an ongoing process, then you'll 
  be much more fulfilled and motivated yourself.</p>
<h3>5. <b>Support employee motivation by using organizational systems (for example, 
  policies and procedures) -- don't just count on good intentions</b></h3>
<p>Don't just count on cultivating strong interpersonal relationships with employees 
  to help motivate them. The nature of these relationships can change greatly, 
  for example, during times of stress. Instead, use reliable and comprehensive 
  systems in the workplace to help motivate employees. For example, establish 
  compensation systems, employee performance systems, organizational policies 
  and procedures, etc., to support employee motivation. Also, establishing various 
  systems and structures helps ensure clear understanding and equitable treatment 
  of employees.</p>

<h2>Steps You Can Take to Support the Motivation of Others</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>The following specific steps can help you go a long way toward supporting your 
  employees to motivate themselves in your organization.</p>
<h3>1. <b>Do more than read this article -- apply what you're reading here</b></h3>
<p>This maxim is true when reading any management publication.</p>
<h3>2. <b>Briefly write down the motivational factors that sustain you and what 
  you can do to sustain them</b></h3>
<p>This little bit of &quot;motivation planning&quot; can give you strong perspective 
  on how to think about supporting the motivations of your employees.</p>
<h3>3. <b>Make of list of three to five things that motivate each of your employees</b></h3>
<p>Read the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/motivation-checklist.htm"
class="textlink">checklist of possible motivators</a>. Fill out the list yourself 
  for each of your employees and then have each of your employees fill out the 
  list for themselves. Compare your answers to theirs. Recognize the differences 
  between your impression of what you think is important to them and what they 
  think is important to them. Then meet with each of your employees to discuss 
  what they think are the most important motivational factors to them. Lastly, 
  take some time alone to write down how you will modify your approaches with 
  each employee to ensure their motivational factors are being met. (NOTE: This 
  may seem like a &quot;soft, touchy-feely exercise&quot; to you. If it does, 
  then talk to a peer or your boss about it. Much of what's important in management 
  is based very much on &quot;soft, touchy-feely exercises&quot;. Learn to become 
  more comfortable with them. The place to start is to recognize their importance.)</p>
<h3>4. <b>Work with each employee to ensure their motivational factors are taken 
  into consideration in your reward systems</b></h3>
<p>For example, their jobs might be redesigned to be more fulfilling. You might 
  find more means to provide recognition, if that is important to them. You might 
  develop a personnel policy that rewards employees with more family time, etc.</p>
<h3>5. <b>Have one-on-one meetings with each employee</b></h3>
<p>Employees are motivated more by your care and concern for them than by your 
  attention to them. Get to know your employees, their families, their favorite 
  foods, names of their children, etc. This can sound manipulative -- and it will 
  be if not done sincerely. However, even if you sincerely want to get to know 
  each of your employees, it may not happen unless you intentionally set aside 
  time to be with each of them.</p>
<h3>6. <b>Cultivate strong skills in delegation</b></h3>
<p>Delegation includes conveying responsibility and authority to your employees 
  so they can carry out certain tasks. However, you leave it up to your employees 
  to decide <i>how</i> they will carry out the tasks. Skills in delegation can 
  free up a great deal of time for managers and supervisors. It also allows employees 
  to take a stronger role in their jobs, which usually means more fulfillment 
  and motivation in their jobs, as well.</p>
<h3>7. <b>Reward it when you <i>see</i> it</b></h3>
<p>A critical lesson for new managers and supervisors is to learn to focus on 
  employee behaviors, not on employee personalities. Performance in the workplace 
  should be based on behaviors toward goals, not on popularity of employees. You 
  can get in a great deal of trouble (legally, morally and interpersonally) for 
  focusing only on how you <i>feel</i> about your employees rather than on what 
  you're <i>seeing</i> with your eyeballs.</p>
<h3>8. <b>Reward it soon after you see it</b></h3>
<p>This helps to reinforce the notion that you highly prefer the behaviors that 
  you're currently seeing from your employees. Often, the shorter the time between 
  an employee's action and your reward for the action, the clearer it is to the 
  employee that you highly prefer that action. </p>
<h3>9. <b>Implement at least the basic principles of performance management</b></h3>
<p>Good performance management includes identifying goals, measures to indicate 
  if the goals are being met or not, ongoing attention and feedback about measures 
  toward the goals, and corrective actions to redirect activities back toward 
  achieving the goals when necessary. Performance management can focus on organizations, 
  groups, processes in the organization and employees.</p>
<h3>10. <b>Establish goals that are SMARTER</b></h3>
<p>SMARTER goals are: specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, timely, extending 
  of capabilities, and rewarding to those involved.</p>
<h3>11. <b>Clearly convey how employee results contribute to organizational results</b>.</h3>
<p>Employees often feel strong fulfillment from realizing that they're actually 
  making a difference. This realization often requires clear communication about 
  organizational goals, employee progress toward those goals and celebration when 
  the goals are met.</p>
<h3>12. <b>Celebrate achievements</b></h3>
<p>This critical step is often forgotten. New managers and supervisors are often 
  focused on a getting &quot;a lot done&quot;. This usually means identifying 
  and solving problems. Experienced managers come to understand that acknowledging 
  and celebrating a solution to a problem can be every bit as important as the 
  solution itself. Without ongoing acknowledgement of success, employees become 
  frustrated, skeptical and even cynical about efforts in the organization.</p>
<h3>13. <b>Let employees hear from their customers (internal or external)</b></h3>
<p>Let employees hear customers proclaim the benefits of the efforts of the employee 
  . For example, if the employee is working to keep internal computer systems 
  running for other employees (internal customers) in the organization, then have 
  other employees express their gratitude to the employee. If an employee is providing 
  a product or service to external customers, then bring in a customer to express 
  their appreciation to the employee.</p>
<h3>14. <b>Admit to yourself (and to an appropriate someone else) if you don't 
  like an employee --</b></h3>
<p>Managers and supervisors are people. It's not unusual to just not like someone 
  who works for you. That someone could, for example, look like an uncle you don't 
  like. In this case, admit to yourself that you don't like the employee. Then 
  talk to someone else who is appropriate to hear about your distaste for the 
  employee, for example, a peer, your boss, your spouse, etc. Indicate to the 
  appropriate person that you want to explore what it is that you don't like about 
  the employee and would like to come to a clearer perception of how you can accomplish 
  a positive working relationship with the employee. It often helps a great deal 
  just to talk out loud about how you feel and get someone else's opinion about 
  the situation. As noted above, if you continue to focus on what you <i>see</i> 
  about employee performance, you'll go a long way toward ensuring that your treatment 
  of employees remains fair and equitable.</p>
