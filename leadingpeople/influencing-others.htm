<h2>Power is Not a Bad Word</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>

<p>The concept of power often evokes negative impressions. For example, referring 
  to the use of power can infer that people are being dominated, manipulated or 
  coerced. However, similar to the concept of conflict, power almost always exists 
  in organizations. Recognizing and managing it can be very healthy for organizations 
  and personnel. The following links provides overviews that progress from basic 
  to a little more advanced.</p>
<h3>Think hard work is all you need for career success?</h3>
<p>Jeffrey Pfeffer, at Stanford University Graduate School of Business disagrees. 
  In his latest book, Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don't, he argues 
  that what you need to succeed in the workplace is, above all, power.</p>
<p>He was asked in an interview with BNET &quot;What is the biggest mistake people 
  make when it comes to achieving power?&quot;</p>
<p>He answered: &quot;I see a lot of people who voluntarily give up the opportunity 
  to have a lot of power by saying things like, 'I won&#8217;t play the game.' 
  That won't get you anywhere.&quot;<br />
  Sources of Power</p>
<p>As a coach of talent, part of my job is to help career starters and emerging 
  leaders see that they have power no matter where they stand on the corporate 
  ladder. It&#8217;s a matter of recognizing and capitalizing on it. There are 
  two sources of power.</p>
<h3>Formal or Position Power</h3>
<p>This is based on your title - manager, supervisor, senior vice-president, etc. 
  With it comes the ability and responsibility to reward (provide someone with 
  a raise or plum assignment) and punish (discipline someone or limit access to 
  resources). However, there's another.</p>
<h3>Informal or Personal Power</h3>
<p>This is based not on your position, but on you. You have the ability to develop 
  expert power (based on highly valued knowledge and skills) and associate power 
  (based upon who you know and who knows you).</p>
<h3>Which is easier to obtain?</h3>
<p>In most cases its personal power. Here are five ways to increase your informal 
  power and not feel you just playing the game. Take a look at these past posts.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Know What's Going On: Information is power so be on constant alert.</li>
  <li> Have Skills Will Travel: This is what you bring to the employment table.</li>
  <li> Develop a Strong Brand: It conveys your distinctiveness as a professional 
    or leader.</li>
  <li> Enhance Your Reputation: Toot your horn occasionally and have others do 
    it as well.</li>
  <li> Build Good Working Relationships: They are the bread of career life so 
    eat often and hearty.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>True power, to get things done, does not come from a title or position. Rather 
  it comes from the value ( your expert power) you produce for your internal and 
  external customers. Figure out ways to make a positive impact (your associate 
  power) on the key people in your career world. That's how you build power careers.</p>
<p>On a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high) how much personal power do you have right 
  now to achieve your career goals? What can you do to get it to a 10?</p>

<h2>Influencing and Persuading</h2>
<p>Do you have great ideas but can't seem to get people to listen?</p>
<p>A recent email from a frustrated manager who, like many of us, has great ideas 
  but finds it difficult getting them accepted and implemented. Perhaps a boss 
  is too busy putting out fires to pay attention. Or, in the give and take of 
  a meeting, your suggestions get lost.</p>
<p>In her years of writing about successful leaders, Rosabeth Moss Kanter of Harvard 
  Business School, states that &quot;getting ideas off the ground requires personal 
  credibility and power.&quot; Here's what she advises -- Four Influencing Strategies:</p>
<h3>1. Showing up: The power of presence.</h3>
<p>It's a clich&eacute; but true that 90% of success in life comes from just showing 
  up. Digital and other remote communications are efficient, but there's much 
  to be said for being there - face-to-face with others.</p>
<h3>2. Speaking up: The power of voice.</h3>
<p>It's more than making noise. It's being articulate, putting your ideas into 
  words that get people to listen and see you as a leader. If you're uncomfortable 
  with public speaking, get a coach, take lessons, join Toastmasters and then 
  stand up and do it.</p>
<h3>3. Teaming up: the power of partnering.</h3>
<p>As you move into leadership, you technical or business skills aren't enough. 
  Success, at this stage of your career, depends more on building good relationships 
  inside and outside your organization. So start &quot;playing with others&quot;.</p>
<h3>4. Not giving up: the power of persistence.</h3>
<p>Everything can look like a failure in the middle. Keep at it, make mid-course 
  adjustments and surprise the naysayers. All successful people have dealt with 
  self-doubt, but they keep on going. So can you.</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>There have been excellent big ideas which couldn't get off the ground because 
  they lacked proper uplift and effort. On the flip side, really good small ideas 
  have revolutionized our lives. What&#8217;s the difference? Perhaps it's these 
  four influencing strategies. What do you think?</p>
