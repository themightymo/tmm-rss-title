<p>Similar to mentoring, there are many perspectives on the definition of counseling, 
  especially since the relatively recent popularity of personal and professional 
  <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/coaching.htm">coaching</a>. 
  Traditionally, counseling might have been described as the activities conducted 
  by a person (the counselor) for another person (the client, friend, etc.) in 
  order to help that other person to solve a problem in regard to themselves, 
  someone else or some other situation. An untrained counselor might provide counseling 
  primarily by offering advice. A professional counselor might work with a variety 
  of other tools, eg, assessments, diagnosis, treatment plans, deep listening, 
  values clarification, direct advice, etc. The approaches and variety of tools 
  used by a professional counselor depend a great deal on their training and paradigms 
  (overall views) of the counselor, eg, psychodynamic, behavioral, humanistic, 
  etc.</p>
<p>Today, there seems to be much ongoing discussion and debate
about the definitions and differences regarding coaching and mentoring,
and also counseling.</p>
