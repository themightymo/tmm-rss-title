<h1>Sustainable Business Development (For-Profit or Nonprofit)</h1>

<!--[index|Sustainable Development]-->

<p>The World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland
Commission), in its report &quot;Our Common Future&quot; (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1987), defines sustainable development:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the 
    present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
    own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>the concept of needs, in particular the essential needs of
    the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given;
    <li>and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology
    and social organization on the environment's ability to meet
    present and future needs.&quot;
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The profession of management is increasingly interested in
sustainable development as today's organizations confront the
realities of managing limited resources, many of which were previously
considered to be unlimited in scope. For example, sustainable
development was the main topic of the national Organization Development
Network's 2003 conference. Sustainable development often looks
at three major aspects of development, including sociological,
ecological and economic. The information in this topic is by no
means complete. However, like so many other topics in the Library,
there's enough in this topic to get you started.</p>
