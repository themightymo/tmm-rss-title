<p>Product (or service) management includes a wide range of management
activities, ranging from the time that there's a new idea for
a product to eventually providing ongoing support to customers
who have purchased the new product. Every organization conducts
product development, whether it's done intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

<p>This module provides a wide overview of considerations in developing
and managing a product. How a product is developed or managed
is depends very much on the nature of the organization and its
products, for example, retail, manufacturing, wholesale, etc.
Note that different people might even have different categorizations
for the activities described below.</p>

<p>NOTE: Nonprofit organizations often provide services in the
form of &quot;programs&quot;, rather than &quot;products&quot;
-- although the services from the programs are certainly &quot;products&quot;
to groups of clients. Therefore, readers from nonprofit organizations
might be better served to read the following guide:<br />

<h2>Basics Introduction to Product Development and Management</h2>

<p>Businesses can generate revenue from selling more of the current
products to more of the current customers (customer maximization),
more of the current products to new customers (customer development),
new products to current customers (product development), or new
products to new customers (diversification).<br />

<h3>To Broaden Your Perspective on Product Development and Management</h3>

<p>Many of the activities in product development are also activities
in the overall process of marketing. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/index.htm">Basics
of Marketing (from idea to evaluating to developing to producing)</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/life-cycle.htm">Life
Cycle Planning (everything has a life cycle, including products)</a></p>

<h3>Broaden Your Perspective Even More?( Or If You Need an Investor
or Funder)</h3>

<p>If the reader is highly motivated at this point, then he or
she might scan the information about the basics of business planning.
Business planning is usually conducted when starting a new organization
or a new major venture, for example, new product, service or program.
Essentially, a business plan is a combination of a marketing plan,
strategic plan, operational/management plan and a financial plan.
Funders or investors usually require a business plan. Far more
important than the plan document, is the planning process itself.<br />

<h2>Approaches to Developing Products
and Services</h2>

<p>There are five different approaches that people use to develop
a product or service. The following article provides an overview
of each of the methods. Additional articles provide additional
perspectives. <br />

<h2>Idea for New Product or Service</h2>

<h3>Sources of Ideas</h3>

<p>At this stage, someone has an idea for a new product or service.
Ideas can come from many sources, for example: <br />
1. Complaints from current customers (see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/customers/service.htm"
class="textlink">Customer Service</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/customer/satisfy.htm"
class="textlink">Customer Satisfaction</a>)<br />
2. Requests for Proposals from large businesses, government agencies,
etc.<br />
3. Modifications to current products (see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/innovation/index.htm"
class="textlink">Innovation</a>)<br />
4. Suggestions from employees, customers, suppliers, etc. (see
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/innovation/index.htm"
class="textlink">Creative Thinking</a>)</p>

<p>Also see <a href="http://www.soho.org/Start_Up_Articles/Find_A_Product.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How to Find a Product to Market
(short, reflective piece on developing an idea)</a><br />
</p>

<h3>Protecting Your Ideas</h3>

<p>It's likely that someone else will think your idea is a good
one, too! Therefore, it's important to protect your idea as much
as possible, for example, by getting copyrights, trademarks or
patents. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/intellectual-property-laws.htm"
class="textlink">U.S. Intellectual Property Law</a></p>

<p>You may want to &quot;package&quot; your product with others,
or sell your new product as a set of products. The following link
might help you in this consideration. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/branding.htm">Naming
and Branding</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/intellectual-property-laws.htm">Intellectual
Property</a></p>

<p>You might also want to minimize the chance of an employee taking
the idea and starting their own business. See<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/employee-laws/employment-contracts.htm#anchor371455">Non-Compete
Agreements</a></p>

<a name="anchor3580455"></a>
<h2>Are You Really Ready for Entrepreneurship?</h2>

<p>It's one thing to have a good idea for a new product or service,
but it's another thing to actually develop and provide it -- that's
the essence of entrepreneurship. The following link is to a resource
that will guide you through complete consideration of whether
you're really ready for entrepreneurship or not.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm">Entrepreneurs
-- Are You Really Ready to Start a New Organization or Product?</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor203973"></a></p>

<h2>Are You Planning a New Business Around Your Idea?</h2>

<p>If you are planning to start a new for-profit business or nonprofit
business around your idea for a new product or service, then you
will benefit from reading information in the topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/starting-business.htm"
class="textlink">Starting a For-Profit Business</a> or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-nonprofit.htm"
class="textlink">Starting a Nonprofit Organization</a>. Note that
information in these two topics will guide you through assessing
the feasibility of your new business -- information in the rest
of this topic about product management will include assessing
the feasibility of developing a new product. It's likely that
if you are starting a new business, you will eventually need information
in the rest of this topic about product development.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1332959"></a></p>

<h2>Product Verification and Funding -- Can Your Idea Become a
Viable Product/Service?</h2>

<h3>You Need More than a Good Idea</h3>

<p>Just because it seems like a great idea doesn't mean that it
can become a product. A viable product needs to be profitable
(or, in the case of a nonprofit, at least sustainable), including
being producible and marketable. Also, the product should be related
to the purpose, or mission, of your business. Businesses can go
bankrupt by trying to be too many things to too many customers,
rather than doing a few things very well.</p>

<h3>If You Need an Investor or Funder for Your Idea</h3>

<p>For-profits that need investment money will benefit from the
following link.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinancing/index.htm">Fundraising
(For-Profit)</a></p>

<p>Nonprofits that need funding will benefit from the following
link.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfundraising/index.htm">Fundraising
(Nonprofit)</a></p>

<p>As noted above, you very well may need a business plan to convince
the investor or funder that your idea is viable to become or product
or service. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessplanning/index.htm#anchor417546"
class="textlink">Basics of Business Planning</a></p>

<h3>Verifying that Your Idea Can Become a Good Product or Service</h3>

<p>At this point, you will benefit from understanding the basics
of marketing, particularly how to conduct market research and
a competitive analysis. If your idea still seems like a good one,
then it's important to know how you will position and identify
your new product to the market. You'll certainly want to know
how much you might charge for it (that is, its price to the customer).
The following links will guide you through these considerations.

<h2>Product Production -- Ongoing Building of Products and Services</h2>

<p>Again, the particular processes you use repeatedly to produce
your products and services depend very much on the nature of your
product or service. The following links will help you to develop
the new product or service, including regularly tracking how many
versions you have produced. <br />

<h2>Product Distribution, Advertising and Promotion, Sales and
Service</h2>

<p>There are several major methods you can use to get your products
or services to your customers or clients. The following link will
help you select the most appropriate method(s).<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/distribution.htm">Distribution</a></p>

<p>Advertising and promotion of products and services are often
some of the most under-rated activities by new business owners.
Many people strongly believe that if they build it, buyers will
come. In this increasingly expanding and competitive marketplace,
you must ensure your products and services are prominently in
the minds of your customers and clients. This requires ongoing
advertising and promotion. <br />

and Promotion</a><br />

<a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/marketing/2012/05/christopher-van-buren-product-launch-liftoff/" target="_blank">Christopher Van Buren: Product Launch Liftoff</a></p>

<p>Even if your products and services are prominently in the minds
of your customers and clients, you need to facilitate the process
of their buying (or, sometimes in the case of nonprofits, using)
your products and services. This often requires cultivating an
ongoing relationship with customers and clients to understand
their needs, explain how your products and services can meet those
needs, and facilitate the &quot;closing&quot; of the sale, that
is, where they sign &quot;on the dotted line&quot;. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/sales/sales.htm">Sales</a></p>

<p>Customers are increasingly knowledgeable and intelligent in
their buying habits. Depending on the nature of the product or
service, a warranty (or promise of ongoing repair and/or support
for some period of time) can greatly reassure customers when considering
the purchase of your products. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/warranties.htm">Warranties</a></p>

<p>Not only can high-quality customer service earn a strong reputation
for your business and products, it can also support continued
purchases and revenue (and even new ideas for new products and
services) from current customers. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/customers/service.htm">Customer
Service</a></p>

<p>All of the product development activities so far come down
to achieving one, ongoing major outcome: <br />
