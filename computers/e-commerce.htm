<h2>Introduction and Basic Overview of E-Commerce</h2>

<p>The Free Management Library will help you address the major
considerations in setting up an e-commerce business. The considerations
are as follows.</p>

<h3>E-Commerce is Like Any Other Business, Except ...</h3>

<p>Developing a business over the Internet requires many of the
same major activities as starting any other business. You should
do some basic business planning. After all, you need a product.
You may need funding to get your business going. You need customers.
You need to market products to your customers. You need strong
customer service. You need to manage purchases by customers, finances,
staff and other resources.</p>

<h3>Not All Products Are Very Compatible to Sales Over the Internet</h3>

<p>But there are some features unique to e-commerce. Not all products
are real compatible to be sold over the Internet. For example,
they may require a lot of face-to-face selling. They may cost
a lot to ship (a primary practice in e-commerce is that customers
buy products, and you ship the products to them). You need to
make sure that, because your product may be advertised to the
world, that you remain in control of your ideas, or &quot;intellectual
property&quot;.</p>

<h3>You Need an Online &quot;Store&quot;</h3>

<p>Basically, you need an &quot;online store&quot; to be an &quot;e-tailer&quot;.
(Don't fret. You may be able to outsource, or hire, a current
store to work with you.) Your store will need a &quot;merchant&quot;
account, or the ability to process your customers' credit card
transactions over the Internet. This includes needing a &quot;secure
server&quot;, or that your online store be on a computer system
that ensures that customers' credit card numbers cannot readily
be read by people who are not supposed to read these numbers.
You'll probably need some kind of online order form that customers
can complete, in order to purchase your products. You may even
want your the processing of customers' order to include processing
the customers' credit card numbers right away while they're still
online and connected to your Website.</p>

<p>Let's read on to understand the very basics of e-commerce.</p>

<h3>Obviously, You Need a Website</h3>

<p>You need to design and promote a Website. You'll need access
to expertise that can regularly design and maintain this Website
for you -- and it will require ongoing attention. Fortunately,
there is a great deal of free information available to help you
with this design and promotion.</p>

<h2>Getting A Computer System for Your Business</h2>

<p>You'll need a computer system to manage information for your
business. The size of the system depends on how much you want
to do with it. However, today's desktop personal computers (especially
if they're configured as part of a client-server system) can handle
many of the demands of e-commerce. (Note that you may need a different
computer system to actually host your Website, conduct financial
transactions with customers, etc.)<br />

<h2>Developing and Managing a Virtual Team</h2>

<p>If you are conducting business over the Internet, it's not
unlikely that you'll use the Internet for most, if not all, of
your communications with employees. You are also likely to use
the Internet to communicate with collaborating organizations,
suppliers, etc. You'll benefit from reading about virtual teams,
or groups of people working together primarily by using the Internet
for means of communications. <br />
