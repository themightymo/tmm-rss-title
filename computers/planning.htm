<h1>Key Questions
When Planning a Computer System</h1>

<h2>About the Need for (or
Problem Solved by) the Computer System</h2>
<p>

1. What is the overall purpose of the proposed system? <br />
2. What major problem(s) does it address in the organization?
<br />
3. How was the problem identified and/or determined? <br />
4. Is the problem well understood and described in the proposal?
<br />
5. What key personnel were involved in defining the problem? <br />
<br />

<h2>About General Requirements
for the Computer System</h2>


1. What are the required functions of the system that will solve
the problem? (This question is often responded to by describing
the technical characteristics of an already preferred computer
system; however, this approach may result in poorly conceived
requirements and an inadequate system. One should first identify
all of the requirements of a new system, and reference these requirements
when selecting the hardware, software, peripherals, networking,
etc.) <br />
2. What planning went into defining these requirements? <br />
3. Were the end-users of the system involved in determining these
requirements (they should be)? <br />
4. Were the general plans for the new system (particularly if
the system is quite costly compared to the budget of the agency)
included in the strategic plans of the agency? <br />
5. Does purchasing the overall system to address the problem have
the support of key leadership in the agency? <br />

<h2>About the Proposed
Solution to the Problem</h2>

1. What are the technical specifications that will meet the above-explained
requirements? Include reference to hardware, software, networking,
training, maintenance and ongoing internal/external support. <br />
2. How was the system selected to meet these requirements? <br />
3. Was a sound cost-benefit analysis conducted? Were all costs
and benefits considered? Consider direct, indirect and ongoing
costs. <br />
4. Were all major alternatives for obtaining the system considered,
such as leasing, outsourcing, etc.? The larger the investment,
the more important that alternatives be investigated. <br />
5. What system was selected to best meet the functional requirements?
<br />
6. Are all key requirements met by the system? <br />
7. Describe the system, including key specifications of the hardware,
software, peripherals, networking, etc. <br />
8. Is the technology appropriate for current market trends and
end-user environments, for example, selecting menu-driven interfaces
rather than command-driven, using generally mainstream vendors,
etc. <br />
9. Is a budget included in the proposal that includes all costs
associated with the purchase, maintenance, and ongoing support
of the system? <br />
10. Are all aspects of the system included in the budget or accounted
for by other means/reports in the proposal? <br />
11. Are item specifications listed sufficiently to assess the
reasonableness of budgets costs for the items? <br />
12. Was attention paid to low-cost solutions? Is it possible to
apply volume discounts in any way? 13. Do all staff and/or volunteers
listed in the proposal, really need computers? <br />
14. What's being done with any old systems? <br />
15. Is the budget approved by key leadership? <br />
16. Has collaboration been considered, either for cost savings
and/or for the good of the community? <br />
<br />

<h2>Implementation Plan
for the Proposed New System</h2>

1. What is the timeline for the project, in particular for the
funding, purchase, implementation, testing of the system and for
evaluating the project? <br />
2. Are the times reasonable? <br />
3. Might funds be dispersed in a staged fashion and associated
with certain benchmarks/milestones to assess the success of the
project? <br />


<h2>About Outcomes and
Evaluation of the Project</h2>

1. What are the benefits and/or outcomes from usage of the proposed
system? <br />
2. How will the project personnel evaluate the progress to the
proclaimed benefits and/or outcomes from the project? <br />
3. What follow-up activities are planned? <br />
