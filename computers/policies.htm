includes a related, comprehensive set of subtopics in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/computers/index.htm">All

<h2><a name="sample" id="sample"></a>Sample Computer Usage Policy </h2>
<p><i>The following wording can be considered by an organization that is considering 
  developing a policy to guide organization members to appropriate usage of the 
  organization's Internet-related resources. This policy is referenced from <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/computers/policies.htm">Polices 
  about Using Computers and Networks</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The (organization's) internal network is connected to the Internet. 
  Everyone wit computer access to the internal network has the ability access 
  the Internet, including use of electronic mail and the World Wide Web. While 
  the Internet is a great resource for our organization, it is the responsibility 
  of each employee to use this resource responsibly and respectfully. It is assumed 
  that the predominant use of these resources will be for work use, and that any 
  personal use of electronic mail or the World Wide Web will be limited; never 
  a priority over work matters. If an employee is found spending excessive time 
  on personal use of these resources, this privilege may be revoked for that employee.</i></p>
<p><i>Electronic mail sent from the Institute should be treated the same as any 
  other communication that is sent. All communications represent the (organization 
  name) as a whole, and as such, should be written in a professional and appropriate 
  manner. This also applies to any material that is published on the (organization 
  name's) World Wide Website.</i></p>
<p><i>If there are any question regarding this policy, please contact ____________.&quot;</i></p>
