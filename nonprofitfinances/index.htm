Applies to nonprofits unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>New nonprofit leaders and managers have to develop at least
basic skills in financial management. Expecting others in the
organization to manage finances is clearly asking for trouble.
Basic skills in financial management start in the critical areas
of cash management and bookkeeping, which should be done according
to certain financial controls to ensure integrity in the bookkeeping
process. New leaders and managers should soon go on to learn how
to generate financial statements (from bookkeeping journals) and
analyze those statements to really understand the financial condition
of the business. Financial analysis shows the &quot;reality&quot;
of the situation of a business -- seen as such, financial management
is one of the most important practices in management. This topic
will help you understand basic practices in financial management,
and build the basic systems and practices needed in a healthy
business.</p>

<h3>Reviewing the Basics of Nonprofit Financial Management</h3>

<p>To manage your finances as effectively as possible, you should
at least have an understanding of the basic accounting process.
To get an overall sense for the recurring financial activities
in the typical nonprofit, carefully read the following article.

<p><a name="anchor1606174"></a></p>

<h3>Use Fiscal Sponsorship?</h3>

<p>In some cases, you might want to pursue finding a fiscal sponsor.
For example, if you're not sure you want to start a nonprofit,
or if your nonprofit may not need to exist for long, then a fiscal
sponsor may be useful for you. A fiscal sponsor might oversee
your financial management activities until your organization is
more developed or terminated. See<br />
<a href="#anchor1824012">Fiscal Sponsorship -- Is it For You?</a></p>

<a name="anchor507700"></a>
<h3>What Type of Bookkeeping System
Should You Use? </h3>

<p>Small organizations might use a single-entry bookkeeping system,
although some might choose to use a double-entry. <br />

<h3>Your Board Treasurer and Board
Finance Committee -- Critical Resources to Help You Get Started</h3>

<p>An active board treasurer can be the most important resource
in the long-term financial health of your nonprofit. As a new
nonprofit organization, you must get accounting expertise somehow,
if you don't have strong skills in this area yourself. You (or,
ideally your board chair) should get someone on your board with
accounting skills to be your treasurer. See<br />

<h3>Getting an Accountant, If Needed</h3>

<p>You might choose to do the basic bookkeeping activities yourself.
You should get an accountant initially to help you set up your
bookkeeping system, generate financial statements and do some
basic financial analysis. <br />

<h3>Buy a Software Package to Automate
Your Financial Management?</h3>

<p>There are a number of very useful software packages that will
help you automate bookkeeping, generation of financial statement
and their analysis. See<br />

<a name="anchor3916681"></a>
<h3>Getting a Bank and Banker</h3>

<p>You'll need to start a checking account. Probably the best
way to find a good bank is to ask for advice and references from
other nonprofits, especially other nonprofits that are of the
size and nature of yours. If you're just starting out, you probably
don't have much money. You may be able to get buy with a non-interest-bearing
checking out that has no, or minimal, fees.The following link

<h2>Understanding and Setting Up Your Nonprofit Bookkeeping and
Accounting</h2>

<p>Now that you have a sense for the overall, recurring activities
in nonprofit financial management. Let's take a closer look at
what happens in nonprofit accounting. Accounting is identifying,
organizing and reporting financial transactions. It's useful to
understand the basics of accounting before reading the next major
section on financial planning -- that planning requires some understanding
of the accounting process. One of the biggest challenges is knowing
how to enter each type of transaction in the journal and ledger.
The following links are very useful for this challenge. Before
reading them, do read <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/basics.htm">Basics
of Nonprofit Financial Management.</a></p>

<h2>Financial Planning</h2>

<p>Financial planning works from the strategic and business plans
to identify what financial resources are needed to obtain and
develop the resources to achieve the goals in the two types of
plans. Typically, financial planning results in very relevant
and realistic budgets -- budgets are addressed later on in this
topic. So be sure to consider business planning for each of your
products and services.</p>

<h2>Budgeting and Managing Budgets</h2>

<p>A budget depicts what you expect to spend (expenses) and earn
(revenue) over a time period . They are useful for projecting
how much money you'll need for a major initiative, for example,
buying a facility, hiring a new employee, etc. They also help
track whether you're on plan or not. There are yearly (or annual
or operating) budgets, cash budgets, capital budgets (for major
assets, such as equipment, buildings, etc.) and proposal budgets
(for fundraising), etc. The following links are about annual budgets.

<p><a name="anchor1732927"></a></p>

<h2>Managing Program Finances</h2>

<p>Usually, there are two major types of costs to consider: indirect
costs and direct costs. Indirect costs are what we sometimes call
&quot;administrative&quot; or &quot;overhead&quot; costs, for
example, costs to run the central facility. Direct costs are those
that fund resources which directly produce services to clients,
for example, supplies and materials for books provided to clients.
Usually, the lower your administrative costs, the more it looks
like your resources are going directly to services to clients.
In addition, you may have restricted grants (that is, grants that
are dedicated for certain programs), which require you to report
monies spent on overhead and directly on the program. Therefore,
it's wise to track carefully how much money each of your programs
requires to operate and how much revenue it generates, as well.
A major challenge is to analyze how much of the indirect costs
are associated with each program. <br />

<h2>Managing Cash Flow</h2>

<p>As a new or small nonprofit, your biggest challenge is likely
to be managing your cash flow -- probably the most important financial
statement for a new business is the cash flow statement. The overall
purpose of managing your cash flow is to make sure that you have
enough cash to pay current bills. Nonprofits can manage cash flow
by examining a cash flow statement and cash flow projection. Basically,
the cash flow statement includes total cash received minus total
cash spent. Cash management looks primarily at actual cash transactions.
(Note that nonprofits must file a financial statement called Cash
Flow Statements or Statements of Cash Flow -- this statement is
not the same as a cash flow budget.)</p>

<h3>Managing Your Bank Account</h3>

<p>For a new nonprofit, your check register very likely will be
your primary means to record and track cash. Whether yours is
a new nonprofit or an established nonprofit, you'll need to know
how to manage your bank account. See<br />

<h2>Credit and Collections</h2>

<p>Matters of credit and collections are similar between for-profit
and nonprofit organizations, other than that nonprofits obviously
grant free services much more than for-profit organizations. Consequently,
nonprofits are not nearly as likely to utilize credit and collections
procedures. <br />

<h2>Budget Deviation Analysis</h2>

<p>You learned above that a budget depicts what you expect to
spend (expenses) and earn (revenue) over a time period. Budget
deviation analysis regularly compares what you expected, or planned,
to earn and spend with what you actually spent and earned. The
budget deviation analysis can help greatly when detecting how
well you're tracking your plans, how much to accurately budget
in the future, where there may be upcoming problems in spending,
etc. A budget deviation analysis report might include columns
with titles:</p>

<p><table width="738" height="72" border="0" cellspacing="0" 
cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">Planned for Month</td>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">Actual for Month</td>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">Difference<br />
    (planned minus actual)</td>
    <td width="25%">
    <p align="center">% Deviation<br />
    (Difference x 100)</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<a name="anchor4108285"></a>
<h2>Financial Statements</h2>

<p>In order to know how your nonprofit is doing, you'll do some
ongoing financial planning and analysis. In this planning and
analysis, you'll likely use your bookkeeping information to produce
various financial statements, including a cash flow statement,
statement of activities and a statement of financial position.

<h3>Statement of Activities (Income Statements)</h3>

<p>These statements include much money you've earned (your revenue)
and subtracts how much you've spent (your expenses), resulting
in the total of your unrestricted net assets. The statement of
activities includes how much money you've earned (your revenue)
and subtracts how much you've spent (your expenses), resulting
in how much you've made money (your profits) or lost money (your
deficits). Basically, the statement includes total sales minus
total expenses. It presents the nature of your overall profit
and loss over a period of time. Therefore, the Income Statement
gives you a sense for how well the nonprofit is operating. <br />

<h3>Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheets)</h3>

<p>Whereas the statement of activities depicts the overall status
of your profits (or deficits) by looking at income and expenses
over a period of time, the balance sheet depicts the overall status
of your finances at a fixed point in time. It totals your all
your assets and subtracts all your liabilities to compute your
overall net worth (or net loss). This statement are referenced
particularly when applying for funding. <br />

<h2>Financial Analysis (individual statements, ratios, break-even
analysis, etc.)</h2>

<p>Financial analysis can tell you a lot about how your nonprofit
is doing. Without this analysis, you may end up staring at a bunch
of numbers on budgets, cash flow projections and financial statements.
You should set aside at least a few hours every month to do financial
analysis. Analysis includes cash flow analysis and budget deviation
analysis mentioned above. Analysis also includes balance sheet
analysis and state of activities analysis. There are some techniques
and tools to help in financial analysis, for example, profit analysis
(yes, these can be used even in nonprofits), break-even analysis
and ratios analysis that can substantially help to simplify and
streamline financial analysis. How you carry out the analysis
depends on the nature and needs of you and your business. The
following links will help you get a sense for the &quot;territory&quot;
of financial analysis.</p>

<h3>Financial Planning and Analysis -- Ratios</h3>

<p>There are a variety of ratios that can be used to help determine
the current and future condition of a nonprofit. The following
links provide explanation and procedures for using those ratios.
The ratios are produced from numbers on the financial statements.
Note that the usefulness of ratios often are from comparing ratios
from different time periods in the same nonprofit or from standards
for a type of nonprofit, eg, social services, associations, civic
organizations, etc. <br />

<h3>Financial Planning and Analysis -- Break-Even Analysis</h3>

<p>The break-even analysis uses information from the statement
of activities and cash flow statements to compute how much sales
or revenue much be accomplished in order to pay for all of your
fixed and variable expenses. Fixed expenses are expenses that
you'd have regardless of the level of sales of products or services
(eg, sales, rent, insurance, maintenance, etc.). Variable expenses
are incurred according to the level of sales of products or services
(eg, sales commissions, sales tax, freight to ship products, etc.).
Break-even analysis can help you when deciding how much to charge
for a service, how much to ask for from donors, etc. <br />

<h2>Financial Reporting</h2>

<p>The types and frequency of reports depend on the nature of
the nonprofit and its situation. Banks might want reports to verify
financial strength to pay back loans. Foundations, individuals,
or other donors may want reports to verify that donations are
being spent as expected by the foundation or donor. The Internal
Revenue Service will want certain reports when filing yearly tax
forms.</p>
