<h2>Brief Overview and History of Various Employee Laws</h2>

<p>There are a variety of federal laws, executive orders, etc.,
regarding the selection and treatment of individuals in the workplace.
Most notable are federal laws established by the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/employee-laws/laws/civil-rights.htm">Employee
Law -- Civil Rights Act of 1964</a><br />
, designed to ensure equal employment opportunity (EEO). Numerous
EEO guidelines are intended to provide equal opportunities without
regard to race, religion, origin, sex, age or disability. The
guidelines also established requirements for affirmative action,
specifying that employers had to take proactive measures to ensure
equal opportunity to certain protected groups. Various other laws
are designed to ensure safety in the workplace, fair pay standards
and fair treatment of employees providing military service.</p>
