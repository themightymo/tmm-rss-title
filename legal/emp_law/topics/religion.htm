<h1>Topics in U.S. Employee Law: 
Religious Rights of Employees</h1>

<!--[index|Legal]-->


Assembled by Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD<br /><br />

<p>This section of the library provides miscellaneous information
which may be helpful as an overview of various aspects of business
law in the United States of America. Businesses designing personnel
policies should obtain advice from an attorney specializing in
the area of employee laws. Businesses requiring legal advice regarding
potential or current litigation should seek counsel from an attorney.</p>

<p>Note that employees laws apply the same to for-profit and nonprofit
organizations.</p>
