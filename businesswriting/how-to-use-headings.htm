<h2>What Report Readers Want to Know From Research/Activity Reports</h2>


<ol>
<li><b>Do I need to read your report?</b> Does the title indicate
a subject that is relevant to my responsibilities? Is the title
accurate and descriptive? Does your report look interesting and
readable?</li>

<li><b>Give me a quick overview?</b> Does your report have an
executive summary so I can decide whether or not I need to read
the whole thing?</li>

<li><b>Why did you undertake this research/activity?</b> Fill
me in on the context and the background. Explain the relevance
of your research/activity to our larger organizational goals.</li>

<li><b>What purposes or accomplishments did you aim for?</b> What
were the major objectives and sub-objectives of your research/activity?
What questions did you ask?</li>

<li><b>What methods, processes, and procedures did you use?</b>
Because I and other may need to make decisions on the basis
of information in your report, I expect to see a detailed description
of what you did to obtain your results/findings. What obstacles
and surprises did you encounter in the process?</li>

<li><b>What are your results/findings?</b> I don't want to know
everything you know about your research/activity. I do want to
know what you discovered/accomplished. I hope you have included
negative as well as positive results, so I and many others can
learn from your research/activity.</li>

<li><b>How do you interpret your results/findings?</b> Your
facts are interesting and important, but they also require some
heavy thinking to interpret. Don't leave all of the difficult,
interpretive work to me. Give me tables, lists, charts, and/or
graphs and point out the patterns in the data. Turn the data info
information.</li>

<li><b>What are the implications of your results/findings?</b> What
do your results/findings mean in terms of others' activities?
Turn your information into knowledge. Go beyond your interpretation
to explain the significance of these results/findings. Do also
express the limitations of these results/findings.</li>

<li><b>What follow-up research/activities do you recommend?</b>
Because you have studied and explored the context, the background,
and the results/findings in some detail, I look to you to offer
recommendations on related decisions and future research/activities.</li>
</ol>

<h4>In short,</h4>
<p></p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the facts?</li>
  <li>What do they mean?</li>
  <li>What do we do now?</li>
</ul>
