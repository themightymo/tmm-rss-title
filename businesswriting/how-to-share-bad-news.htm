<h1>Formats for
&quot;Bad News&quot; Correspondence</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->

<h2>Two Formats, Two Results </h2>
<p>

&quot;Bad news&quot; memos
and letters are easier to write when you remember the two formulas
for organizing the content of such correspondence. Although the
formulas appear to be only slightly different, the reader is likely
to respond to each format in a different way.
</p>

<h3>Indirect format, or &quot;You are
a valued person.&quot;</h3>
<p>1. Thanks ...<br />
2. Because ...<br />
3. Sorry ...<br />
4. Thanks ...</p>

<p>By using the indirect formula you prepare the reader for the
bad news while you develop in his or her mind the rationale for
your &quot;no&quot; decision. The indirect format is designed
to preserve relationships under difficult circumstances for both
writer and reader. It is gracious and definite and can be empathetic.</p>

<h3>Direct format, or &quot;Go away and
don't bother us again.&quot;</h3>
<p>
1. Thanks ...<br />
2. Because ...<br />
3. Sorry ...<br />
4. Thanks ...</p>

<p>By using the direct formula you quickly inform the reader of
your decision. If you choose to add a reason for your decision,
keep it simple. The direct format is <i>not</i> designed to preserve
the relationship between writer and reader. Nevertheless, it is
courteous and definite.</p>

<p><i>Choose the bad news format
that fits your purpose.</i></p>
