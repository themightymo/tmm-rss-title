<p><i>American Heritage Dictionary</i>

(2nd Ed.). (1982). Boston:
Houghton Mifflin.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A dictionary is essential, even
  in the days of word processing programs with spell-check features.
  Besides listing words and word forms not included in most computer
  dictionaries, the <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> provides
  usage notes for words that are frequently misused, such as affect-effect,
  which-that, and than-then.</p>

<p>Strunk, W., Jr., &amp; White,
E. B. (1979). <i>Elements of Style</i> (3rd Ed.). New York: MacMillan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seventy years after its first
  publication in 1919, <i>The Elements of Style</i> is still a
  favorite resource for writers who sympathize with the needs of
  their readers. Readers should keep in mind that Strunk and White
  used sexist language and many examples in which women are not
  treated as equals. William Zinsler, an authority on writing as
  well, suggests that at least once each year we read this slim
  volume and remember the authors' wise counsel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lanham, R. A. (1987). <i>Revising
business prose.</i> (3rd Ed.). New York: Charles Scribner's Sons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This slim book is based on the
  premise that serious business writers can learn to eliminate
  &quot;shopping bag&quot; sentences and &quot;officialease&quot;
  from their writing. If the fog index of your writing rises into
  the stratosphere, this book is for you. <i>Revising Business
  Prose</i> is a resource for the difficult problems of editing,
  shortening, and rewriting text that may be beyond the comfort
  zone of your readers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bates, J. D. (199). <i>Writing
with precision</i>. (3rd Ed.). Washington, DC: Acropolis Books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The subtitle of this book, &quot;How
  to write so that you cannot possibly be misunderstood,&quot;
  is a goal worth striving for even though it is impossible to
  achieve. Sloppy, imprecise written communications have incurred
  untold millions of dollars of unneeded business expense and the
  subsequent loss of profits. Read <i>Writing with Precision</i> to
  learn how to edit your own and others' business writing with
  precision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flower, L. (1989). <i>Problem-solving
strategies for writing.</i> (3rd Ed.). San Diego: Harcourt, Brace,
Jovanovich.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linda Flower offers steps and
  strategies to the serious student of business writing--of any
  writing for that matter. She discusses the process of writing,
  including defining your purpose, organizing your information,
  and cueing your reader.
</p>

<p>Rico, G. L. (1983). <i>Writing
the natural way.</i> Los Angeles: J. P. Tarcher (Houghton Mifflin).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you seek a method for accessing
  all that you know about a topic before you write? The expression
  &quot;creative writer of business correspondence&quot; is not
  an oxymoron. Writing anything is a creative act. Even our now-routine
  letters represent some once-creative efforts. Business writers
  who read this book will enjoy taking advantage of the vast capabilities
  of their brains.

<p>Brusaw, C.T., Alred, G.J., &amp;
Oliu, W. E. (1987). <i>Handbook of technical writing.</i> (3rd
Ed.). New York: St. Martin's Press.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you write reports, instructions,
  and specifications, your job will be made easier by referring
  to models supplied by the authors.
