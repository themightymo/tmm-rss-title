<h1>Use Your New Typographic Capabilities</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />

You may have learned to type on a mechanical
    typewriter. At that time, typists emphasized words by capitalizing
    or underlining them, which was all the capabilities they had.
    Today's business writer has nearly all the capabilities of a
    professional typesetter at his or her fingertips. This article
    contains strategies for using the typographic capabilities in
    Microsoft Word and other word processing programs.<br />

<h2>Boldface</h2>

Boldfaced type is commonly
    used in headings, such as Word's Level 1 heading, which was used
    as the title style for this article, and Word's Level 2 subheading,
    which was used to introduce this segment. In general text, boldface
    is not used for emphasis because boldfaced words stand out like
    facial blemishes. As an alternative, some business writers use
    italics for emphasis. It would be even better if they limited
    their use of italics and relied on sentence structure to make
    their emphases clear. <br />
    
<h2>Italics</h2>

Italics can be used to
    show that a word is to be read as a word, for example &quot;The
    word <i>system</i> is much misused in business writing.&quot;
    Foreign words that have not been absorbed into English are italicized.
    The titles of complete works--books, newspapers, poems, songs--are
    italicized. Titles of parts of works--articles, chapters--are
    enclosed in quotation marks.<br />

<h2>Small caps</h2>
Use small caps for 
<font size="-1">A.M.</font>
    and 
<font size="-1">P.M.</font>
Modern practice recommends using small caps
    for acronyms that are pronounced as words, for example 
    <font size="-1">RAM</font>
    memory. Initialisms, which are pronounced letter by letter, are
    typed in full caps, for example CPU. When you follow this rule,
    readers will know how to pronounce what you write.<br />

<td width="50%" valign="top">

<h2>Dashes</h2>

The hyphen (-), the en
    dash (<i>(the en dash is slightly longer than the hyphen</i>),
    and the em dash (<i>sometimes represented by two hyphens: --</i>)
    are important and useful horizontal characters. The hyphen, in
    addition to being used to break a word at the end of a line,
    is used to connect two words that modify another, for example
    &quot;Come to a 3-day meeting.&quot; The en dash is longer than
    a hyphen and shorter than an em dash. It is used to connect two
    numbers, for example &quot;Circle October 3 (<i>en dash)</i> 5
    on your calendar.&quot; The em dash, the longest of the three
    characters, is used to indicate a break in the structure of a
    sentence, for example &quot;We could allow 20 minutes for--oh,
    let's not bother with that issue at the meeting.&quot; The hyphen,
    which is easily accessed via the keyboard, should not be substituted
    for the en dash and the em dash. To find the two longer dashes,
    open the Insert menu, select Symbol, and locate them on the character
    map for normal text. Select the desired dash and insert it into
    your text. Note the absence of blank spaces before and after
    these three characters.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    
<h2>Special characters</h2>
To shorten the process
    of adding em dashes and other special characters to your text,
    learn their ASCII code numbers. To insert a special character
    into your text, hold down the <i>Alt</i> key and type 0 and its
    code number on the number pad. When you let go of the <i>Alt</i>
    key, the special character is inserted in your text at the cursor.
    For example, to insert an em dash, hold down <i>Alt</i> and type
    0151 on the number pad. Lift your finger from the <i>Alt</i>
    key and voila!<br />
    
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

Double-spacing between
    paragraphs often uses too much page space, especially when you
    are trying to keep your text to a single page. At your direction,
    the computer will add extra points of space above each paragraph.
    To set a paragraph style with additional line space above it,
    as I have done with all the paragraphs in this article, open
    the Format menu and select Style. In the Style windows, select
    in order <i>normal style</i>, <i>modify</i>, <i>format</i>,
    <i>paragraph</i> and type 3 pt in <i>spacing before</i>. Close and
    apply.</td> 

<td width="50%" valign="top">
    
<h2>Indents</h2>
Punching the tab key
    to indent the first line of every paragraph by five full spaces
    was great for typewriters and for lines of text six inches long.
    In columnar text, the first lines of paragraphs are usually indented
    by a space the equivalent of an <i>M</i>. To match the paragraph
    style in this article, use a first-line indent of 0.15 inches.
    Make this adjustment in the Format menu. Select Paragraph and
    set the first-line indent under Special.<br /><br />
    Lists may be indented the same amount. <br />
    <ul>
    <li>The default indent for bulleted lists in Word is 0.50
    inches--too large an indent for columnar text. Set it at 0.15
    inches. </li>
    <li>To ease the typing of indented lists, create a new paragraph
    style. Set the left margin indent about 0.15 inches, and indicate
    a hanging indent about the same amount. Name the new style <i>bullet</i>.
</li>
    <li>Word's default setting for the distance between the
    bullet and text is 0.25--again, too large. To reset this distance,
    search under the Format menu for Bullets and Numbering, select
    <i>Modify</i>, and set the distance at 0.15 inches.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Titles</h2>
The title of this article
    is centered and set in large, bold-faced type--22-point Arial [Lucida Sans in the online version].
    It could be even larger, but I chose to keep the title on a single
    line. By convention, the whole title or just the important words
    in the title are capitalized, but this convention is often ignored
    in favor of the more easily read sentence capitalization style.
    Research has shown that readers find all caps very difficult
    to read. Capitalized words have no ups and downs to help the
    reader discern the differences among the letters.<br />
    
<h2>Subheads</h2>

Subheads (headings) are
    used to indicate the hierarchy of text. Let the style and size
    of type say &quot;This is a head; pay special attention because
    it indicates the relative importance of the text that follows.&quot;
    Traditionally, headings were capitalized like titles; that is,
    the initial letter of each word was capitalized, except articles,
    conjunctions, and prepositions of five or fewer letters. Today's
    business writers increasingly choose to use sentence capitalization
    for headings; that is, they capitalize only the initial word
    and any proper nouns. Headings may be followed by quotation marks,
    question marks, and exclamation points, but not by periods, colons,
    or semi-colons.<br />
</td> 
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    The text within the heading and the level of each heading form
    a well-organized content outline. The writer decides how many
    levels of headings to use. The savvy reader skims the headings
    to understand how the text is organized. The highest level in
    the hierarchy of headings indicates to the reader that a major
    section will follow. The next lower level indicates subsections.
    All headings of the same level are constructed in parallel form.
    For example, the headings in this article are nouns with a descriptor
    as needed.<br />

<h2>Spaces</h2>
Some hard-won typewriting
    practices are no longer acceptable in today's computer-formatted
    text. You may have a well-entrenched habit of adding two spaces
    between sentences. You may even think your text looks better
    that way. Not so. Adding the extra spaces makes your reader's
    job harder.<br /><br />
    You can use the search-and-replace feature in the Edit menu to
    change all instances of two spaces to one space. Before applying
    the spellcheck function and printing your work, search for two
    spaces [  ] and replace with one space [ ]. This search-and-replace step is especially important when
    using the Times font, which tends to hide extra spaces on the
    screen but shows them clearly on hard copy.<br />
    
<h2>Smart quotes</h2>

If your program's default
    <i>preferences</i> setting specifies straight quotation marks,
    it's time to change to &quot;smart quotes.&quot; To learn how
    to make this change, search for <i>smart quotes</i> in the Help
    menu. <br /><br />
    Don't use smart (curly) quotes when you need straight quotation
    marks, as in foot (') and inch (&quot;) marks. To add these straight
    marks, go to the Insert menu and select Symbol. Find the desired
    marks on the character map and insert them in your text.<br />

</td>
  </tr> 
</table></p>


<p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">

<h2>Fractions</h2>
Commonly used fractions,
    in which the numerator and denominator are smaller than the normal
    text, can be found in the Insert menu under Symbol, for example
    &frac34;. For hints on using superscripts and subscripts to build
    unusual fractions, for example 3/35, search the word-processing
    manual or the help file.<br />

<h2>Font style</h2>
For highly readable paragraph
    text, use Times in its 10- to 12-point size, 12-point if your
    readers wear bifocals or have resisted getting bifocals past
    the point of needing them. The text of this article is 10-point
    Times. [Lucida Fax "small" in online version]<br />
    For highly visible headings, use Arial in its 14- to 16-point
    size and boldface the text. See the default settings for heading
    styles in Word.<br />
    
</td> 
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
<h2>Fancy type</h2>

Resist using a variety
    of fancy fonts. <font face="chiller" size=+2>Blocks of text in Algerian, Braggadocio, or other
    fancy fonts may be nearly unreadable.</font> 
    But blocks of text in Times will
    not tire your reader. Make your words exciting and meaningful
    through skillful writing, not by using tricks and gimmicks. Grayed
    boxes and outlined or shadowed type, when used indiscriminately,
    shout
<br /><font size="+2" face="ZapfChancery">Amateur! </font><font size="+1">or
    </font><tt><font size="+2" face="Courier">UNPROFESSIONAL!</font></tt><br />
    In summary, with these word-processing
    strategies you will enhance the presentation of your ideas and
    ease your writing chores. Explorations into the word-processing
    manual or help file will yield other useful techniques.
