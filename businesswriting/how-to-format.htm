<p align="center"><b><font size="110%">
This is a title: <br />
The subtitle qualifies it</font></b></p>

<p>The title is large type, centered,
and may be all caps or sentence style as above. The introduction
to the paper requires no heading because it comes first. The statement
of purpose comes early in the introduction and is often followed
by a list of the specific objectives the writer expects to achieve
in dealing with the topic. In the following sentences or paragraphs,
the writer provides background information to help the reader
understand the context, definitions, assumptions, history, and
so on.
</p>
<p>The writer may close the introduction with his or her plan for
organizing the main points of the paper that follows. Papers that
are ten or more pages long require a title page, a table of contents,
and an executive summary.
</p>


<h2>This is a major heading</h2>
Major headings are typed flush
left, sans-serif if possible (that is, use of characters that
have no curled or enlarged &quot;tails&quot;; the font of characters
in this document has these &quot;tails&quot; and so is serif in
nature), boldface, and four points larger than the paragraph type
that follows. They signal the start of large sections of content.
Long papers require three levels of headings. Short papers require
only two levels of headings. <br />
<br />

<h3>This is a minor heading</h3>
Minor headings are typed
flush left, sans serif, boldface, italic, and two points larger
than the paragraph type that follows. Headings function as signposts
for the reader, who should be able to see the shape of the paper
simply by skimming the title and the headings. All headings at
a single level must be grammatically parallel. Breaking out long
lists of items that are buried in paragraph text also helps the
reader. Lists are indented on the first tab and aligned 0.15&quot;
behind bullets or numbers. Note the following formatting details
for the paper:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&middot; One and one-half inch margins
  all around the page<br />
  &middot; Ragged right margins<br />
  &middot; Single spacing<br />
  &middot; 12-point Times ( This short sample was written in 12-point
  Times and may show up as such to the reader, depending on settings
  in their Web browser.) <br />
  &middot; No end punctuation for items in a list (unless they
  are complete sentences)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>This is a paragraph heading</b>
. 
Paragraph headings use normal paragraph type
and boldface. They end in periods, which are not boldfaced. Paragraph
headings are clearly and logically related to the minor heading
that precedes them. The paragraphs in this model are block style
and have 6 points of added space above, which eliminates the need
to double-space between them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is indented behind
  the first tab. Indent either a long quotation or a long example.
  Long quotations are referenced (author, year, page number).<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">Number pages at center or right.</p>
