<h1>Writing a
Procedure that the Reader Can Follow</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />


<h4>Definition:</h4>
A written procedure is a step-by-step guide to
direct the reader through a task.<br />
<h4>Advice:</h4>
Read this procedure all the way through before you begin
to write.</p>

<h4>Preparation:</h4>

<p>Step 1. Provide a purpose statement (why this procedure).<br />
Step 2. Provide an overview of the procedure.<br />
Step 3. Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills, if any.<br />
Step 4. Highlight any safety issues and other precautions.<br />
Step 5. Add a list of equipment, supplies, or parts needed for
the procedure.</p>

<h4>Writing:</h4>

<p>Step 6. Define a logical sequence
of steps and substeps, neither too large nor too small. <br />
a. Use the imperative voice for clarity and economy of
words. <br />
b. Write to the level of the reader's ability or a little below.
Define unfamiliar terms.<br />
Step 7. Include hints and helps.<br />
Step 8. Add illustrations, analogies, models, anything that will
aid understanding of the process and the end product.</p>

<h4>Follow up:</h4>

<p>Step 9. Pilot test your procedure.
Is it understandable, effective, complete? Does it result inefficient
and effective performance? <br />
Step 10. Inform the reader of the performance standard to be applied
when the procedure is a practiced skill.</p>
