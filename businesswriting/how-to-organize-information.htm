<h1>Organizing
Information in Written Reports </h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />


<p>By using appropriate headings in their
reports, writers are more likely to address their readers' needs
for information. Organizing information under headings (Table
1) makes writing tasks easier and reports more complete. </p>

<h2>Table 1. Headings for four types of reports</h2>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    <h3>Work plan</h3>

</td> 
    <td valign="top">
<h3>Final report*</h3>
</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
<p>Title--Be descriptive (consistent
    with a previous proposal, if any).
</p>

<p>Purpose--State the purpose of the
    work in one or two clear sentences.
</p>

<p>Background--Take the rational from
    the original proposal and add background as the reader needs.
</p>

<p>Summary--<i>Write this section last</i>. It functions as an

    from plan, include rationale for changes.</p>

    two lists the persons responsible for the action items. Column

    <td valign="top">
<p>Who went where, project #, and date

    This documentation is important for later reference and easily
    done when all the information is at hand.</p>

    projects and two purposes, the writer may want to file two separate
    trip reports.</p>

<p>Objectives--List questions answered or avenues explored. <i>Objectives</i>
    may be included in the <i>Purpose</i> section.</p>

    of the trip and your thinking about what transpired.</p>

<p>Summary--<i>This section must be written last but may be inserted
    early in the report</i>. It functions as an executive summary
