<h1>Using a Variety of Appeals to Sell Your Idea, Service, or Product</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />


<p>Readers are rational, emotional, and
spiritual beings. If you write to change readers' opinions or
to get them to accept your point of view, you could decide to
appeal to their minds, their hearts, and their souls:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&middot; Minds through reason (logos)<br />
  &middot; Hearts through emotion (pathos)<br />
  &middot; Souls through ethics (ethos)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Logos</b>.
Logical appeals rely on evidence, such as research data or examples.
Use reason to convince a skeptical reader of the truth or validity
of your argument. Use reason to ask someone to take a new view
of a situation. <br />
<br />
<b>Pathos</b>. Emotional appeals attempt to arouse the feelings
of the reader. Daniel Goleman, Author of <i>Emotional Intelligence,</i>
says that such appeals rely on tapping the energy associated
with basic feelings of fear, enjoyment, anger, surprise, or disgust.
Two other basic feelings seem generally less applicable in writing
to persuade in a business setting: sadness and shame. Emotional
appeals are most effective when the reader can be expected to
agree with your argument and you want the reader to act.<br />
<br />
<b>Ethos</b>. Ethical appeals rely on the reader's sense of right
and wrong. Such appeals depend on the writer's credibility as
a respected expert, reliable contributor, or well-informed observer
whose opinions are believable because they are ethically sound.
Ethical appeals are most effective when the reader can be moved
by what is said and by who is saying it. <br />

<h4>Examples:</h4></p>

<p>A writer seeks to increase the budget
for new computers in her department. She could use
</p>

<p>Logic--&quot;A new computer would
increase our productivity by 5 percent. Since our combined salaries
are $300,000, that's a productivity increase worth $15,000. Subtract
the cost of $7500 for the computers, and you have a net gain of
$7500.&quot;</p>

<p>Pathos--&quot;Our old computers are
so inadequate that we are feeling super cautious (fear) about
tackling the biggest barcoding job.&quot;
</p>

<p>Ethos--&quot;It's only fair that our
department gets new computers at this time. Our present computers
are five years old. The neighboring department got new computers
two years ago.&quot;

  <p><i>Know your reader and choose
    logic, pathos, ethos, or all three--whatever works.</i>
