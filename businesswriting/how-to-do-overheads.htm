<h1>Guidelines
for Creating Overhead transparencies</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />


<p>Unless one is a gifted orator, the
belief that spoken words are the meat-and-potatoes of a presentation
is mistaken. The presenter who wants the audience to grasp the
meaning of her message, must strive to create readable, interesting,
informative transparencies (slides). In times past, words were
the primary means for transmitting abstract concepts. Today's
audiences, however, are visual learners. They live and work with
eyes focused on television, computer monitors, videos, photos,
films, advertising graphics, and so on.</p>
<p>
Visual images tend to dominate over words: The presenter who seeks
to influence others' actions or decisions will plan to accommodate
the human preference for visual information. According to research,
learners should be telling us: &quot;I hear it, I forget it.&quot;
&quot;I see it, I take it in.&quot; &quot;I see it, hear it, and
do it; it's mine.&quot; In summary, will you tell people? Sure.
Will you show them? Certainly. Will you ask them to interact with
you, one another, and the content of your presentation? Absolutely.
Using all three methods - auditory, visual, and kinesthetic --
enhances your ability to influence audiences.</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    Type face = Times or Arial<br />
    Point size = 20+<br />
    Case = Sentence type<br />
    Location = Top 2/3 of slide<br />
    Page set up = Landscape<br />
    Ideas = One per slide <br />
    Lines = Six per slide<br />
    Words = Six per line<br />
    Color? = Yes, if available<br />
    Contrast = More important than color<br />
    Graphics? = Absolutely<br />
    Clip art? = If appropriate and additive</td>
  </tr> 
</table><br />
<h3>
Production hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let PowerPoint
ease your way to designing effective slides. If you already know
Microsoft Word, learning PowerPoint will be a snap. Focus your
efforts on formatting, organizing, and managing information and
on gaining proficiency with the superb drawing tools in PowerPoint.</li>
<li>Produce a paper copy of each slide; stand up; throw the
copy on the floor; and critically review it from the audience's
perspective. </li>
<li>Print slides on laser transparency film. Use a color
printer if one is available.</li>
<li>Insert the slides in special sleeves that frame the slide
(3M makes them).</li>
<li>Produce black and white or color handouts to facilitate
note taking and review--two slides per page. </li>
<li>Create presenter notes pages in PowerPoint. To enable
you to easily read your notes from their position on a lectern
or a table top, use 16- to 18-point type.</li>
</ul>
