<h1>Designing the Page for Readability:  
Macropunctuation for Memos and Reports </h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->

<p>Make your writing visually appealing,
well organized, and simple to take in and remember. Even though
you write for a captive reader, do not assume that he or she will
be fascinated with what you have to say.
</p>

<h3>Use headings and subheadings</h3>
<p>Help speed recognition of
what the page contains. Use headings to communicate a sense of
order and conciseness. Make your communication look planned, coherent,
and forthright. Order is important. Start with a statement of
your purpose for writing. Add the when, who, how, and where details
that you have organized into some rational order. Say what you
think about the above, and end with a summary. Put endless tables
of data in an appendix.
</p>

<h3>Don't tax your reader's power to take
in information</h3>
<p>Straight text looks formidable.
The reader braces himself or herself for an ordeal--for heavy
going. Because we humans have relatively limited capacities for
information processing, you should present your information in
bite-sized chunks, which your reader may then quickly note and
take in. Keep paragraphs short--seven lines of type at the most.
The shorter, the more irresistible your paragraphs are.
</p>

<p><table width="521" height="23" border="0" cellspacing="0" 
cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
<blockquote>
      Put key ideas in indented paragraphs
      where they will be noticed. Just as you noticed this paragraph.
</blockquote>
</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Look for opportunities to use numbered
or bulleted lists. Numbers designate order or hierarchy. If your
word-processing program does not create bullets, you can create
them by filling in lower-case o's with a felt pen. Remember to
make all the items in your lists grammatically parallel and to
add no punctuation because the list is its own punctuation.
</p>

<h3>Use white space as a foil </h3>
White space is not random
nothingness. It is a tool; use it! White space is functional when
it works to lift your ideas off the page and into your reader's
mind. Be concerned with the use of margins and the consistency
of spacing between lines and paragraphs. A 60-character line or
less will help your reader track correctly through your text.
And keep white space white (clean). Eliminate visual nuisances
such as fancy borders or prominent logos.</p>

<h3>Use a style sheet</h3>
<p>For consistency, design template
files with your preferred page layouts for letters, reports, and
memos. Save these settings in separate files and lock them. Some
word processors have a styles feature to facilitate paragraph
formatting. Style sheets save you time because you make the small
but important decisions involved in formatting your written communications
just once. Style sheets also help you create a consistent, professional
image.
</p>

<h3>Add visual appeal</h3>
<p>Add personality and drama
to your correspondence by incorporating hand-written notations,
graphic illustrations, and charts. Graphics attract. Use graphics
to break up the page and to lead the reader's eye right to where
you want it -- perhaps to the second and third pages of a long
memo.
</p>

<p>Checklists, sidebars, summaries, tables,
graphs, hand-written notations, and cartoons will add to the visual
appeal of the page. (Exception: Place series of tables and graphs
in an appendix.) <br />
<br />
<h3>Use restraint</h3>
<p>Sparingly employ italics,
boldface, underlining, upper-case type, asterisks, and changes
of font or type size. Too much variety creates an impression of
complexity or messiness. Eliminate noise, such as unnecessary
periods at the end of items in a list and parentheses after the
numbers in a list. </p>

<h3>Highlight important text</h3>
<p><table width="50%" border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
    To draw attention to important
    material, place a border around a short passage. See your word-processing
    manual for how to add 5-points of space around the type.
</td>
  </tr>
