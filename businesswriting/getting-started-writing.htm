<h1>Techniques for Getting Started Writing</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->


Contributed by Deane Gradous, Twin Cities consultant<br /><br />


<p>&middot; Set a timer for 510 minutes,
and write for the entire time. Aim to write anything that is even
slightly related to your topic. It's OK to set down your thoughts
and feelings about approaching this writing task.
</p>

<p>&middot; Ask a colleague to listen
while you talk about your writing project and the ideas you plan
to convey to your reader. Then go to your computer and start writing.
</p>

<p>&middot; Take a handful of 3&quot;
x 5&quot; index cards and write your ideas on them, one per card.
Arrange and rearrange your cards in an order that makes sense.
Add ideas as they occur to you. Then tape the cards to a large
sheet of paper and fill in the details around each idea. Very
often, the ideas on the cards become headings or topic sentences
for paragraphs.
</p>

<p>&middot; Begin to write anywhere in
the middle of the piece. Start with the most interesting [to you!]
part. Your enthusiasm may carry you into completing your writing
project. Write the beginning of the piece last or whenever you
are ready to do so.</p>

<p>&middot; Put your reader in an empty
chair and talk to your reader as if he or she were sitting across
the desk from you. What is your reader most interested in learning
from what you are writing? After your conversation, start writing.
</p>

<p>&middot; Listen to baroque music.
Mentally explore your topic. Reread your notes. Relax, and let
your subconscious take over for a few minutes. Expect an A Ha!
Write quickly.</p>

<p>&middot; Go for a walk and consider
what you want to say to the reader. Return to your computer, and
start writing.
</p>

<p>&middot; Create a Mind Map. Write
your way around it.
</p>
