<h1>Comparison Between E-mail and Voice Mail</h1>

<!--[index|Communications (Business Writing)]-->

<h2>Chart of comparisons</h2>

<p><table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
    <h3>E-mail</h3>
</td>
    <td>
    <h3>Voice mail</h3>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    For less urgent messages* <br />
    Appears to <i>request</i> attention.</td> 
    <td>
    For more urgent messages* <br />
    Appears to <i>demand</i> attention.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    The reader may read the message many times to be sure he or she
    understands it. Vanilla layout gives few clues about differences
    in importance. The language alone, must convey relative importance
    or urgency.</td>
    <td>
    The listener generally tries to understand and remember the message
    the first time through but may rewind the tape and repeat it
    as many times as necessary. Tone of voice and language yield
    clues about relative importance or urgency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Written, may be read quickly or slowly, as the receiver desires</td>
    <td>
    Oral, must be listened to at the speed it was delivered</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    May be stored on disk for future reference. Easy to access specific
    stored messages.</td>
    <td>
    May be stored on tape for future reference. Hard to locate specific
    stored messages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Provides a record of message sent and message received, which
    reassures the sender and saves the reader an acknowledgment step.</td>
    <td>
    Provides a short-term record of the message. Many voice-mail
    systems provide no record for the sender that the message has
    been received.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    The receiver accesses the message at his or her convenience,
    perhaps long after the usefulness of the message has passed.</td>
    <td>
    The flashing signal that indicates a voice-mail message is waiting
    is potentially irritating to the receiver, especially if he or
    she is feeling pressured by other events.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    The writer organizes and edits the message for the reader on
    screen. If the message contains typos and other errors, the writer
    may appear careless, inconsiderate, or illiterate.</td>
    <td>
    The speaker is responsible for organizing the message. If the
    message contains pauses, repetitions, or backtracking, the speaker
    may sound inarticulate or poorly organized.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Preferred by visual learners</td>
    <td>
    Preferred by auditory learners</td>
  </tr>
