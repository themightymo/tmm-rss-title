<h2>Who's Responsible for Your Career?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<p>Many think of it as a 50-50 arrangement. I carry 50% of the responsibility 
  for my career development and my employer carries 50%. Yes, in theory, but not 
  in reality. Here&#8217;s the rub.</p>
<p>What an employer considers 50%, you may consider only 10% and be dissatisfied. 
  And what you feel is your 50% contribution, may be considered a measly 20% by 
  your employers. This leads to mismatched expectations and employee/employer 
  frustrations.</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line:</h3>
<p>If you are concerned about your career advancement, as you should be, then 
  take complete ownership of it. These are some of the things you could do to 
  take charge of your career:</p>
<h3>1. Build your career capital.</h3>
<p>Career capital consists of your qualifications, experience and reputation. 
  It requires investments of time and resources to grow. Find workshops and trainings 
  that would enhance your capabilities. Don&#8217;t assume your organization has 
  no money for professional development &#8211; you won&#8217;t know unless you 
  ask. However, you may need to do it on your own time or even with some of your 
  own money. Realize this is an investment in your future.</p>
<h3>2. Be known and be seen.</h3>
<p>Take the initiative. Ask your manager for the opportunity to lead a task force 
  or take on a project outside of your job duties. For example, head a committee 
  recommending personnel policy changes, facilitate the next staff meeting or 
  make a presentation to upper management or the board. It&#8217;s not only who 
  you know or who knows you but, most importantly, who knows and is impressed 
  by what you can do.</p>
<h3>3. Find a mentor.</h3>
<p>You need to have someone who can introduce you to people, give you strategic 
  career advice and help you learn from his or her mistakes. Mentors don&#8217;t 
  have to be in your organization. Look around your community. Who is doing interesting 
  work? Who inspires you? Develop a relationship first before popping the mentor 
  question.</p>
<h3>4. Work with a coach.</h3>
<p>While a mentor can help build your network and give advice, a coach can build 
  your skills and help you develop a winning career strategy. That person can 
  also work with you on the leadership or managerial challenges you&#8217;re currently 
  facing so that you don&#8217;t make career fatal mistakes.</p>
<h3>5. Above all, make sure you perform well.</h3>
<p>You can do all the other stuff, but if you do not deliver, sooner or later 
  you will trip up. So step number one in your career development is to do what 
  you are currently doing to the very best of your ability and with all your energy 
  &#8211; even if it is not yet what you ultimately want from your career.</p>
<h3>Your career is your responsibility.</h3>
<p>Yes, of course, you manager should have your best interests in mind, but your 
  career development is not at the top of his her daily to-do list. It should 
  be on the top of yours. So, to take charge of you career, set time aside to 
  answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> What can you do right now to enrich your present job or assignment?</li>
  <li>What career options can you start exploring for challenge, variety, or greater 
    personal satisfaction?</li>
  <li>What internal training courses or external seminars can you participate 
    in for professional development?</li>
  <li>Are there off-the-job experiences that could enhance your portfolio of skills 
    and your reputation as a leader?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Career Planning?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<h3>To make it happen in your career, you need to plan your career.</h3>
<p>Career planning is a process of understanding oneself, exploring career options, 
  making wise decisions and moving forward. What complicates it is that people, 
  careers and organizations are constantly changing.</p>
<p>Therefore, career planning is not something done one time early in your career. 
  Rather, it&#8217;s an ongoing process throughout your life. It doesn&#8217;t 
  matter what&#8217;s your profession, your industry or your place of employment. 
  The reality is lives change, professions change, industries change, organizations 
  change and so your career will change. You can bet on it!</p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>The foundation of career planning, today and for the future is based on a very 
  clear understanding of who you are as an individual and as a professional person. 
  As a career coach, I&#8217;ve found that the greater the congruency between 
  who you are &#8211; your skills, values, interests and personality &#8211; and 
  your career choices, the greater personal career satisfaction.</p>
<p>Since everyone has a unique mix of skills, strengths and limitations that change 
  over time, the first step in career planning is to look at who you are and what 
  your career is all about. Also, gaining clarity about yourself will help you 
  make better decisions in the future when challenges and opportunities emerge.</p>
<h3>Identity Questions</h3>
<p>Here are some simple, but profound, questions to start you on this journey. 
  You may want to choose someone, or several people, to help you reflect and provide 
  additional feedback.</p>
<ul>
  <li> What do I see as my personal strengths?</li>
  <li>What are some of my personal limitations?</li>
  <li>What are my core values &#8211; what&#8217;s important to me?</li>
  <li>What are my abilities &#8211; things I&#8217;m good at and enjoy doing?</li>
  <li>What have I done, or I am doing now, that makes me feel proud?</li>
  <li>What are the significant influences on my life that have affected my career?</li>
  <li>Do I have talents that I feel are underdeveloped &#8211; how can I start 
    utilizing them?</li>
  <li>What are my current obligations or commitments? How might they affect my 
    career?</li>
  <li>If I could turn the clock back, what career choices or decisions would I 
    make differently?</li>
  <li>If I could turn the clock ahead, what are some things I would like to accomplish 
    in my life?</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Do You Know?</h3>
<p>What have you learned about yourself from this self assessment? Perhaps you 
  would like to have deeper insights. There are career assessment tools that provide 
  personalized information on skills, interests, personality and values or career 
  anchors. Would you like to know more, then let&#8217;s start a dialogue.</p>

<h2><a name="stages" id="stages"></a>Career Stages: Which One Are You In?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<p>Careers are like life, they don&#8217;t stand still. They progress from one 
  stage to another.</p>
<p>Here are career stages that you are going through, have been through, or hope 
  to go through. Pay attention to the potential roadblocks &#8211; they can make 
  or break your career advancement.</p>
<h3>Stage I - Apprenticeship: Learning the Ropes</h3>
<p>You are fresh, most likely young or starting over in a new career. You are 
  hungry for knowledge and seek out guidance from others. At first you are most 
  likely part of a team with specific tasks. You may be closely supervised until 
  your boss has confidence in your abilities. Your &#8220;job&#8221; is not only 
  to do the work assigned but also to learn about the culture, the company, and 
  the colleagues you work with.</p>
<h4>Potential career roadblock: Settling into your current role.</h4>
<p>As you develop your capabilities, you may become too comfortable. You&#8217;re 
  no longer the new kid on the block. You know your way around. This is the most 
  important time to grow in your career. Ask for more assignments that will expand 
  your expertise and experience. Keep moving ahead.</p>
<h3>Stage II &#8211; Independent Contributor: Establishing a Reputation</h3>
<p>Now you are a doer. You are taking on more responsibility and developing technical 
  depth in assignments. You re also given more autonomy - making decisions that 
  you boss made earlier in your career. You may be part of a committee that makes 
  recommendations on the best software or ways to increase customer satisfaction. 
  This is an opportunity to stand out and shine.</p>
<h4>Potential career roadblock: Indecision about your next career move.</h4>
<p>Most of us in this stage could steer our careers in several directions. If 
  you are not sure where you want to end up, you may never move toward the goal. 
  So assess if you want to expand your expertise with more challenging assignments 
  or start leading projects or teams in order to develop your managerial abilities. 
  See Generalist vs Specialist.</p>
<h3>Stage III &#8211; Leader: Developing and Managing Others</h3>
<p>You have the title of supervisor, manager or director. As you progress in this 
  position, you have staff under you. It could be 5 people or even 50. You now 
  get things done and get results through others. You are assigning tasks, managing 
  their work efforts and coaching them to improve or enhance their performance. 
  It may be difficult for you not to be so hands-on since your hands-on skills 
  are what got you here.</p>
<h4>Potential career roadblock: Not focusing on your interpersonal skills.</h4>
<p>Management is dealing with all kinds and levels of people &#8211;subordinates, 
  peers, boss or bosses, other departments or business units, even other companies 
  and the list goes on. It&#8217;s important to have well developed communication, 
  negotiation, team building skills. If you don&#8217;t, your career growth will 
  be in jeopardy.<br />
  Stage IV &#8211; Executive: Exercising Power</p>
<p>You have significant organization responsibility. Your focus is not on day 
  to day operations but on strategy - the future of the organization. Your role 
  is to be proactive &#8211; to anticipate change, plan for it, initiative it 
  and lead the organization as it goes through it. That requires dealing more 
  with the external environment and making tough, hard decisions.</p>
<h4>Potential career roadblock: Not using the real influence that you have.</h4>
<p>By being indecisive and not pushing strategy forward, you may appear wavering 
  or lackluster. People look to their senior leaders for vision, guidance and 
  encouragement especially in these very changing times.</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip:</h3>
<p>By knowing what career stage you are in, you can focus on the key tasks and 
  avoid the key roadblocks so that you are most effective. Also by knowing the 
  next career stage, you can anticipate and prepare for your next position. In 
  that way you will be proactive, rather than reactive, in your career management.</p>
