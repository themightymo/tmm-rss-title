<h3>Are you looking for more than just a better job?</h3>
<p>Rather, you&#8217;re seeking a more rewarding profession, one that better aligns 
  with your skills, interests, values, and plans for the future. It will not happen 
  overnight. It will take reflection, planning and motivation. Here are five tips 
  for making the transition into a new, rewarding career.</p>
<h3>1. First be sure of your reasons.</h3>
<p>Just because you&#8217;re unhappy in your current job isn&#8217;t a strong 
  enough reason to make a total career break. Carefully analyze whether it is 
  your actual career you dislike or whether the problem is your employer, supervisor, 
  or workplace environment.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unhappy with your boss or the politics of the job, an option 
  is to stay with your career choice and try to find another department or division 
  to work in. However, after much soul searching, you truly feel you would be 
  happier in another career, then start looking.</p>
<h3>2. Decide what&#8217;s important.</h3>
<p>Take an honest inventory of your likes and dislikes, and evaluate your skills, 
  values, and personal interests. You may want to consider consulting a career 
  coach or taking a career assessment to determine what is the right career for 
  you. Many people who want to change careers do so to find a balance between 
  their personal and professional lives; to get the juices flowing again; or to 
  achieve a better mix of meaning, money and motivation.</p>
<h3>3. Check your qualifications.</h3>
<p>Do you have the necessary experience and education to be considered a qualified 
  candidate in another career field? If not, then find a way to bridge the credentials 
  gap. This might mean making your goal more long-term while you go back to school 
  or receive additional training.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t expect to begin at the same level of seniority in your new 
  career that you held in your old one. You probably will have to take a lower 
  level job to gain the requisite skills and then move up the ranks. You must 
  realize that it&#8217;s not starting at the bottom but really starting from 
  a place that will give you mobility for career growth and, most importantly, 
  career satisfaction.</p>
<h3>4. Look before you leap.</h3>
<p>Be sure to examine all possibilities before attempting a career change. Do 
  information interviewing with people who are actually in that career field. 
  Test the waters to see if you would like that work by volunteering or by doing 
  free lance work. You can also meet with a career management professional to 
  guide you so that you make a wise career choice. You do not want to jump from 
  the frying pan (your present career) into the fire (a career that does not meet 
  your expectations).</p>
<h3>5. Update your job search skills.</h3>
<p>When was the last time you looked for a job? If it&#8217;s been 5, 10 or more 
  years ago, then it is especially important to polish up your job-hunting skills 
  and techniques before you get out there. I&#8217;ve seen too many good people 
  fail because they made the following mistakes:</p>
<p>They quickly put a resume together without focusing on what they are &#8220;selling&#8221;; 
  they primarily looked on line for open positions rather than networking; they 
  did not prepare for each interview thinking they can &#8220;wing&#8221; it; 
  and they felt uncomfortable in self &#8211; promotion (it&#8217;s on my resume, 
  why do I have to explain what I did?&#8221;)</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that a successful career change can take several months, or longer, 
  to accomplish. The keys are specific plan, a lot of patience and an attitude 
  of perseverance.</p>
<h2><a name="survive" id="survive"></a>Career Survival Strategies to Ride the 
  Waves of Change</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<h3>Change is a fact of life. Don&#8217;t resist it; thrive in it!</h3>
<p>In these days of takeovers and mergers, of downsizing operations and multiple 
  rightsizings, chances are you&#8217;re going to be caught up in some form of 
  major workplace change at least once in your career. Probably several times!</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a new job or a new boss or a new direction, the best career 
  survival strategy is to respond effectively to these four stages of workplace 
  change.</p>
<h3>Stage 1. Something&#8217;s Up: What To Do Before The Change</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll have some advance warning and time to prepare. 
  But most of the time, you just have an uneasy feeling. There might be lots of 
  hushed conversations or closed-door meetings. Top management might seem especially 
  busy and inaccessible. Or the rumor mill is running high. </p>
<p>This is not the time to stay buried behind your desk or in your office hoping 
  everything will be OK. Rather get out there, keep informed and start thinking 
  about your options for riding the waves of change.</p>
<h3>Stage 2: Getting Acquainted: The First Couple of Months</h3>
<p>In the first weeks of the transition, take extra care to be visible, productive 
  and open to change. This is not a good time to go on vacation for two weeks. 
  Ask yourself: Is there still career opportunity here or should I now begin looking 
  elsewhere more earnestly? You need to decide to put your energy into making 
  a go of it or starting to let go.</p>
<p>If you have a new boss, ask for a meeting to discuss your background, to provide 
  an update on your projects and to find out about the new priorities for your 
  team, department or division. If it&#8217;s a restructuring, understand the 
  reasons behind it. What is the company dealing with now, that it wasn&#8217;t 
  dealing with in the past? What goals is it trying to accomplish in the reorganization? 
  In what way can you contribute to these new goals?</p>
<h3>What do you see on the horizon? I bet it's change and more change!</h3>
<p>In these days of takeovers and mergers, of downsizing operations of multiple 
  &#8220;rightsizings&#8221;, chances are that you are going to be caught up in 
  some form of major workplace change at least once in your career. Probably many 
  times!</p>
<h3>Stage 3. Settled In: The Six Month Benchmark</h3>
<p>Now that the dust has settled, it&#8217;s the time to gauge your career health. 
  Do I feel like an active participant or am I on the sidelines looking in? Have 
  I gotten reassuring comments or positive feedback? If you are in the dark, take 
  the risk and request a meeting with your boss to discuss your performance.</p>
<p>You need to be direct. Say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been working hard to cooperate 
  and adjust to the changes. So how am I doing? Are there things I need to work 
  on to be more effective?&#8221;</p>
<p>You may get an indirect response such as: &#8220;You&#8217;re doing fine, keep 
  up the hard work&#8221;; or &#8220;Let&#8217;s set a time to discuss this further.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, don&#8217;t be satisfied with an evasive or avoidance answer. Performance 
  feedback is essential during times of organizational transition. If all the 
  signs are looking good, you can start breathing a sign of relief. But, don&#8217;t 
  let your guard down completely. The next six months are also very important.</p>
<h3>Stage 4. A Year After: Is The Coast Clear?</h3>
<p>By the time you&#8217;re a year or more into a major change, it&#8217;s reasonable 
  to wonder: Has my work life settled down at last? Has the sense of crisis passed? 
  If this is the case, great! You&#8217;ve come through the storms of change and 
  now are going on to calmer times, at least for the short term, &#8211; long 
  term who knows?</p>
<p>Or, is the atmosphere still very hectic despite many attempts to try to fix 
  what&#8217;s not working? Or, is everything on hold again for the nth time waiting 
  for someone to make the decision? Or your workload is not easing up but getting 
  worse? Sad to say, sometimes things never calm down especially in troubled company 
  or rapidly changing ones. If this is your scenario, you may decide to take a 
  break from the relentless change. You can try to find a calmer port within your 
  company or you may need to seriously consider finding a new position somewhere 
  else.</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>Taking control of one&#8217;s career sometimes means making some very hard 
  decisions. But once a decision is made and action is taken, then you can get 
  on with your life. Isn&#8217;t that what career management is all about&#8212;taking 
  charge of one&#8217;s destiny?</p>
<p>Readers, are you currently dealing with a new boss, a direction or other workplace 
  changes? If so, what stage are you in? How well are you doing? Let me hear your 
  stories.</p>
