<h2><a name="do" id="do"></a>Do You Know Why You Didn't Get the Interview?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>A recent article in Wall Street Journal discussed eight blunders made by job 
  seekers. The list included:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Entitlement syndrome- asking for things such as free lunch at the conclusion 
    of the interview</li>
  <li> Behaving rudely- examples included bringing a child to the interview or 
    opening a sandwich during the interview</li>
  <li> Acting arrogantly-accepting a call during the interview</li>
  <li> Lies, lies, lies- a candidate falsely claimed a referral from a company 
    employee</li>
  <li> Dressing down- wearing jeans or attire that doesn&#8217;t fit to an interview</li>
  <li> Over sharing- sharing personal information</li>
  <li> Saying thanks with gifts- sending gifts instead of a simple note to thank 
    the interviewer</li>
  <li> Sporting a mom-and-dad complex- having mom or dad contact the interviewer</li>
</ol>
<p>For those you who recruit regularly, you are can probably relate to this list 
  and can most likely share your own horror stories of things candidates have 
  done in the interview process. My list of recruiting blunders seems to be a 
  little more common than the WSJ list, but still equally as damaging and many 
  applicants seem to be oblivious to the fact that they ruin their chances of 
  being hired. </p>
<ol>
  <li> Sending in a resume with the changes marked (track changes function in 
    word still showing)</li>
  <li>Not completing the application</li>
  <li>Submitting an application full of grammatical, spelling or typographical 
    errors</li>
  <li>Not following the application directions </li>
  <li>Lies or fabrications on the resume or application (although these will be 
    found in the background checks, many candidates seem to forget their own lies 
    and admit the falsehoods in the interview or show the inconsistencies between 
    the resume and the application)</li>
  <li>Arriving late to the interview without an explanation or apology</li>
  <li>Knowing absolutely nothing about the company or the position</li>
</ol>
