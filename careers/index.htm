<h1>Jobs and Career Development</h1>

<!--[index|Career Development]-->

<p>Businesses used to partner with employees to carry out employees'
career planning and development. Times have changed. Now, businesses
are coming to view career development primarily as the employee's
responsibility. If you are concerned about your career, as you
should be during these turbulent economic times, then take complete
ownership of it.</p>

<p>Where do you want to be one, three, five or ten years from
now? Do you have an action plan to get there? What career options
are there for you to get greater challenge, variety or personal
satisfaction? How well do you leverage your strengths and networks
to advance your career? Are you using the latest job search strategies
so that you can stand out from the crowd? In other words, how
well do you manage your career?</p>

<p>The following major categories of information will provide
you with answers to these and other career development questions
so that you will be in the driver&#146;s seat of your professional
and managerial life <br />
