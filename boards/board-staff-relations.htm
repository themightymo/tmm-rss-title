<p>The nature and extent of interactions between Board members
and staff (employees) depends on the Board model used by the organization.
Often, the model is not intentionally and explicitly chosen --
it's the result of how members ended up working together. Working
(or hands-on) Boards often include members interacting with employees
on a regular basis. In contrast, in policy Boards, Board members
and employees often do not have strong interaction with each other;
however, employees might attend Board meetings to give reports
or participate in certain Board Committees. In any case, it's
often wise for Boards and executives to specify the nature and
extent of interaction expected between Board members and employees.</p>

<p>In addition, there are certain practices that ensure that Board
members and employees have strong appreciation of each other's
roles and can contribute to each other's accomplishments. Links
in this section help Board members and employees to maximize their
mutual understanding and contributions in the workplace.</p>
