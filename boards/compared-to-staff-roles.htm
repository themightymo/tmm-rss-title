<h1>Board and Staff Responsibilities</h1>

<!--[index|Boards of Directors]-->


<p>To help convey who does what regarding
board and staff, the following activities are suggested to be
done by board, staff or jointly. Ultimately, the responsibility for the 
various activities depends very much on the life-cycle of the 
organization -- young organizations often have working Boards that are 
involved in day-to-day activities, while older organizations have Boards 
that attend exclusively to top-level policies and plans. This document should be reviewed
by board members to finalize who they would like to do what among
board and staff members. </p>
