<p><i>The document is a sample of a rather detailed, emergency-driven
development plan from a board to an executive director, &quot;Jim
Struggles,&quot; who struggles to develop basic supervisory skills
in his leadership role of Agency-in-Need. Typically, a board is
not this hands-on, unless the chief executive clearly needs the
help. This struggle is not all that uncommon, particularly with
leaders who are highly entrepreneurial. This type of development
plan might be posed by a Personnel Committee, staffed by one or
two experienced managers who recognize the need for the change
in management style by the executive director. The plan would
be reviewed by the Committee with the Board Chair and then, if
acceptable, posed to the chief executive to work an accommodating
arrangement. Next, the entire board might review and authorize
the plan if there is not strong contention (in which case, there
may be other issues to work). This plan could be adopted by the
chief executive and the board as mutual means to develop the chief
executive and ensure the long-term health of the organization.
Note that detailed nature of this plan is to provide Jim an example
of the clear, specific nature needed by him in his performance
reviews of his staff -- an area in which he struggles.</i></p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Considering the specific staff-related issues now in Organization-in-Need
and the supervisory area where the Executive Director, Jim Struggles,
agrees he needs to improve, the Board Development and Personnel
Committee suggests that Jim implement this supervisory skills
development plan. This &quot;back to the basics&quot; plan is
straightforward, specific and starts small for now. After the
following activities have been conducted reliably, then the plan
could be embellished. <i>Consistent</i> <i>performance</i> of
the following activities by Jim will develop more stability in
Organization-in-Need , ultimately requiring less supervisoral
time from Jim, making Jim more proactive, increasing staff morale
and improving performance. Note that this plan is focused specifically
to supporting Jim's supervisory skills and does not replace the
formal performance evaluation conducted once a year by the Organization-in-Need
board. <br />
<br />
1. <b>Realign his priorities (this development plan guides this
realignment)</b><br />
- he considers himself weak in needed supervisory skills, and
ends up focusing on doing <br />
what he's good at and what has built Organization-in-Need so far:
fundraising <i>(nonprofit only)</i>, speaking and organizing<br />
- for now he needs to refocus more on internal <i>development</i>
and less on expansion<br />
- he should stay around the office more to conduct the following
supervisoral activities<br />
<br />
2. <b>Manage staff performance -- performance based on behaviors
in the workplace</b><br />
<i>(Note that the following suggestions should be in accordance
with the organization's official (authorized by the board) personnel
policies.)</i><br />
- avoiding performance issues ultimately decreases morale, decreases
Jim's credibility, <br />
decreases Organization-in-Need's overall effectiveness and wastes
more of Jim's time when he resorts to doing other staff's jobs
because they don't seem capable of doing them<br />
- he should consistently get written weekly status reports from
direct reports; these are useful for<br />
understanding and monitoring work, and as a basis for training
new staff if needed<br />
- when an important job is not done or is done poorly, immediately
tell the employee and <br />
store away a brief note of reminder about the event; ask the staff
member if they need any special resources they don't currently
have to complete the job, and if so, see that they soon get the
resources; if the resources are personal in nature, e.g., they
need therapy, then be empathetic, but realize this is their responsibility
and continue to focus on their conducting the behaviors needed
to effectively do their job at Organization-in-Need<br />
- on a second occurrence of a job being done poorly by the employee,
write a memo to the employee and present it to him or her in a
meeting; in the memo, indicate what you saw that needs improvement,
that you talked to the employee before and on what date, again
ask if there's anything you can do to help the employee improve.
Tell the board of the situation.<br />
- on the third occurrence of a job being done poorly, promptly
document the issue in a &quot;warning&quot; memo again provided
to the employee in a 1-on-1 meeting; in the memo, describe the
issue including previous conversations about the issue, and warn
that if the issue occurs again, they will be fired<br />
- on the fourth occurrence, fire the employee (Organization-in-Need
deserves good employees!!!)<br />
<br />
3. <b>Consistently hold staff meetings (builds teams, reduces
stress and Jim's so he is more proactive)</b><br />
- this ultimately produces more efficient time management and
supervision for Jim<br />
- for clarity, focus and morale, be sure to use agendas and ensure
follow-up minutes<br />
- in meetings, review the overall condition of Agency-in-Need
and review recent successes of Agency-in-Need<br />
- in meetings, have each member give an overview of current activities
and planned activities<br />
- in meetings, plan the activities that require mutual coordination
among managers<br />
<br />
4. <b>Have consistent 1-on-1 monthly meetings with direct reports</b>
<br />
- this ultimately produces more efficient time management and
supervision<br />
- guide &quot;sudden&quot; supervisoral issues to be handled later,
in these 1-on-1 meetings<br />
- review completed activities and planned activities (more specifically
than in staff meetings); <br />
it's typical to be surprised at what and how much is going on
of which the leader isn't aware <br />
- leave time near the end of the meetings for Q and A from the
staff member<br />
- start <i>basic</i> performance reviews with each staff; these
meetings will <i>greatly</i> facilitate <br />
performance review planning and implementation; these reviews
build accountability and <br />
morale; staff deserve reviews; include the staff member's input
to the reviews<br />
<br />
5. <b>Manage and report on the budget</b><br />
- Jim has many of the skills needed to manage the budget; he needs
refocus to the budget<br />
- he should analyze the budget himself, including for a) highlights,
b) trends and c) issues<br />
- he should present this information himself in a report to the
board <br />
<br />
6. <b>Establish and enforce personnel policies and procedures
to effectively deal with recurrent issues</b><br />
- make a list of recurrent issues, e.g., staff doesn't promptly
hand in client payments<br />
- write a policy with a procedure for each issue, e.g., of how
payments should be handled<br />
- have the board personnel committee review the policy<br />
- work the policy -- make every effort not to perform the procedure
himself<br />
<br />
7. <b>Cap his work hours at a maximum of 50 hours a week</b><br />
- these suggested activities will likely be somewhat uncomfortable
(at first) for Jim -- board members hope that he'll likely come
to appreciate the simplicity and benefits of these regular actions<br />
- this cap is a rather straightforward measure to help ensure
a reasonable stress and work load<br />
<br />
8. <b>Once a year, schedule a half-day session with all staff
to update policies and procedures</b><br />
- for smaller organizations that are usually averse to policies,
this once-a-year event seems to<br />
effectively focus staff attention on policies and procedures,
ensure all staff members are aware <br />
of them and ensure policies exist where needed <br />
<br />
<b>Milestones for Implementation of this Plan</b><br />
This plan produces certain tangible outputs which can reviewed
to help guide Jim's implementation of this development plan. Board
members are available to help guide Jim in this effort, but would
like to see items done by certain dates to ensure they're not
lost in a crack. Members would like to see Jim drive the effort
to produce the following items by the following due dates.<br />
