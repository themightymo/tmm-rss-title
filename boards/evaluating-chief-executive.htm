<h2><a name="anchor894354"></a><b>Benefits of Evaluating the Chief Executive</b> 
</h2>
<p>Evaluating the Chief Executive is a primary responsibility of the Board. There 
  are several key benefits from this evaluation, including that the process:<br />
  1. Ensures the Board is meeting its duty to effectively lead the organization<br />
  2. Ensures organizational goals are being met<br />
  3. Ensures continued development of the Chief Executive to more effectively 
  conduct his or her role<br />
  4. Ensures a formal and documented evaluation process that meets standards of 
  fairness and practicality<br />
  5. Ensures the Chief Executive values his or her role, is benefiting from it 
  and therefore is more likely to stay (finding good Chief Executives is increasingly 
  difficult)<br />
  6. Leaves written record of the Board's impression of the Chief Executive's 
  performance in case this record is needed for future verification, e.g., for 
  salary increases, probationary activities, firing, etc.</p>

  <a name="anchor895059"></a><b>One Process to Evaluate the Chief Executive</b></h2>
<h3>A Sample Schedule</h3>
<p>Note that, more important than doing an evaluation at a certain scheduled time, 
  is doing an evaluation at all, so do the evaluation when the Board believes 
  is the best time for its members.</p> </p>

  <a name="anchor896288"></a><b>Special Considerations</b></h2>
<p>1. Don't worry about specifics of the process as much as being sure that the 
  evaluation is conducted yearly.<br />
  2. Be sure the process is fully documented in a procedure so the process is 
  well understood and carried out consistently year to year.<br />
  3. If staff members are involved in evaluation of the Chief Executive, be sure 
  this procedure is clearly specified and understood by the Chief Executive.<br />
  4. The evaluation should be carried out by a Board committee, not by one Board 
  member. Committees might be the Executive Committee, a Personnel Committee or 
  an ad hoc committee.<br />
  5. If the Board perceives the Chief Executive to have performance issues, Board 
  members can initiate an evaluation. DO NOT initiate evaluations only when there 
  are perceived issues -- this is abusive. Be sure these perceptions are based 
  on seen behaviors rather than on personality characteristics.<br />
