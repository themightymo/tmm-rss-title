<p><i>The following descriptions are
intended to portray various functions that are often conducted
by board committees. Note that the following list is not intended
to suggest that all of these committees exist within one organization;
it's ultimately up to the organization to determine which committees
should exist and what they should do for that organization. Committees
and their assignments are often specified in the ByLaws. Some
of the following information has been adapted from materials by
BoardSource, but applies to for-profit and nonprofit boards unless
otherwise noted.<br />

<h2>About
Committees</h2>

<br />
1. Establish committees when it's apparent that issues are too
complex and/or numerous to be handled by the entire board.<br />
2. For ongoing, major activities establish standing committees;
for short-term activities, establish ad hoc committees that cease
when the activities are completed. Standing committees should
be included in the by-laws.<br />
3. Committees recommend policy for approval by the entire board.<br />
4. Committees make full use of board members' expertise, time
and commitment, and ensure diversity of opinions on the board.<br />
5. They do not supplant responsibility of each board member; they
operate at the board level and not the staff level.<br />
6. Committees may meet monthly (this is typical to new organizations,
with working boards), every two months, or every three months;
if meetings are not held monthly, attempt to have committees meet
during the months between full board meetings.<br />
7. Minutes should be recorded for all board meetings and for Executive
Committee meetings if the ByLaws indicate the Executive Committee
can make decisions in place of the board when needed.<br />
<br />

<a name="anchor18214"></a>
<h2>Developing
Committees</h2>

<br />
1. Ensure the committee has a specific charge or set of tasks
to address, and ensure board members understand the committee's
charge<br />
2. Have at least two board members on each committee, preferably
three<br />
3. Don't have a member on more than two committees<br />
4. In each board meeting, have each committee chair report the
committee's work since the past board meeting<br />
5. Consider having non-board volunteers as members of the committee
<i>(mostly common to nonprofits)</i><br />
6. Consider having a relevant staff member as a member of the
committee as well<br />
7. Committee chairs are often appointed by the board chair; consider
asking committees members for a volunteer for committee chair<br />
8. If committee work is regularly effective and the executive
committee has a strong relationship with the chief executive,
consider having board meetings every other month and committee
meetings between the board meeting<br />
9. The chief executive should service <i>ex officio</i> to the
board and any relevant committees (some organizations might consider
placing the chief executive as a member of the board -- this decision
should be made very carefully)</p>
