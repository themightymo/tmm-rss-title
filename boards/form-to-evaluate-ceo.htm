<p><i>The following is one sample form that might be used by the Board to evaluate 
  the Chief Executive. This sample should be customized to the particular culture 
  and purpose of the agency by modifying the performance criteria (in the following 
  table) as appropriate for the organization, inserting those criteria in the 
  table below, and conducting the evaluation using the updated table.</i> </p>

<p><b>Directions:</b> 
<br />
1. The Board establishes a policy for evaluating the Chief Executive
and establishes a current or ad hoc committee to carry out the
evaluation. See &quot;<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/evaluating-chief-executive.htm">Guidelines for the
Board's Evaluation of the Chief Executive</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Board, working with the Chief Executive,
establishes performance criteria and inserts them in the table
below. References organizational goals and the Chief Executive's
job description.
</p>

<p>3. The Board assigns specific weighing
factors for each of the major categories below. Factors depend
on what the Board believes should be priorities for the Chief
Executive during the evaluation period. The factors should total
100%. Example weightings might be finances 15%, revenue 20%, human
resources 15%, products/programs 20%, facilities 10%, planning
and governance 20%.</p>

<p>4. Each Board member and the Chief
Executive completes the table below about the Chief Executive's
performance during the evaluation period. Each criteria is ranked
from 1-5, with 1=unsatisfactory, 2 = partially within expectations,
3=meets expectations, 4=exceeds expectations, and 5= far exceeds
expectations. This numerical ranking system tends to give perspective
more than commentary. Rankings with commentary is ideal.</p>

<p>5. Multiply each ranking by the category's
weighting factor. Put the answer in the score column.
</p>

<p>6. On a separate sheet of paper, provide
any commentary that addresses rankings below 3. Consider adding
commentary for high ratings as well.
</p>

<p>7. Provide evaluation sheet and commentary
to the Board member who is assigned to collate the sheets (usually
the Board Chair).
</p>

<p>8. The Board may decide to provide
the Chief Executive an average ranking for each category. Similarly,
commentary can be summarized or each comment provided to the Chief
Executive.
</p>

<p>9. The evaluation committee provides
the evaluation report to the Chief Executive and schedules a meeting
with him or her shortly thereafter.
</p>

<p>10. Ensure the meeting is update and
ends on a positive note.
</p>

<p>11. Ensure plans are made to address
ratings below 3, including specific actions by specific dates.
