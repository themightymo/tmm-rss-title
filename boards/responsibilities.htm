<p>There are a variety of views about the roles and responsibilities
of a board of directors and most of these views share common themes.
This document attempts to portray those themes by depicting various
views. Simply put, a board of directors is a group of people legally
charged with the responsibility to govern a corporation. In a
for-profit corporation, the board of directors is responsible
to the stockholders -- a more progressive perspective is that
the board is responsible to the stakeholders, that is, to everyone
who is interested and/or can be effected by the corporation. In
a nonprofit corporation, the board reports to stakeholders, particularly
the local communities which the nonprofit serves.</p>

planning and implementation, and in management of the organization
and its personnel</p>

<p>- to offer administrative guidance and determine whether to
retain or dismiss the executive<br />
<br />
3. <b>Govern the organization by broad policies and objectives</b>,
formulated and agreed upon by the chief executive and employees,
including to assign priorities and ensure the organization's capacity
to carry out products/services/programs by continually reviewing

<br />
4. <b>Acquire sufficient resources for the organization's operation</b>s
and to finance the products/services/programs adequately<br />
<br />
