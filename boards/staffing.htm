<h1>Staffing (Size, Joining, Recruiting, Informing, Communicating,
Rewarding, Removing)</h1>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter

<p>One of the most important aspects of Board operations is Board
staffing. Just like the careful staffing that is usually done
with employees, Board members should be carefully selected, trained
and evaluated, as well. In for-profits, Board members and leaders
must appreciate the strong value that Boards can bring, rather
than tolerating Boards as if they are some necessary evil to be
avoided at all costs. In nonprofits, Board members and leaders
should not approach recruitment and selection as if they are somehow
lucky just to get Board members who will show up at Board meetings.
Board members and leaders in those organizations must act as if
they deserve a very dedicated and participative Board -- that
attitude alone can make a huge difference in achieving highly
effective Boards.</p>

<p>There are different perspectives on staffing. Some people believe
that Boards should be staffed primarily with the expertise needed
to establish and achieve current strategic goals (this is functional
staffing). Others believe that staffing should also achieve a
wide diversity of values and perspectives among members on the
Board (diversification staffing). In nonprofits, members are also
sought who have strong passion for the mission (passion-driven
staffing). We're learning, though, that passion alone is not enough
-- Board members also must have the time and energy to actively
participate in the Board. Yet another perspective is to get members
who represent the major constituents of the organization (representative
staffing).</p>

<p>Ironically, many people perceive for-profit Boards as being
more established and effective. Yet nonprofit Boards very often
have highly involved members who take a very strong role in establishing
strategic plans and in ensuring that those plans are achieved.
Board members of for-profit and nonprofit organizations have much
to learn from each other.</p>
