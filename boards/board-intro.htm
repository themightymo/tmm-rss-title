<h3>What is a Board of Directors? What Does a Board Look Like?</h3>
<p>A corporation, whether for-profit or nonprofit, is required
  to have a governing Board of Directors. To explain, a corporation
  can operate as a separate legal entity, much like a person in
  that it can own bank accounts, enter into contracts, etc. However,
  the laws governing corporations require that a corporation ultimately
  is accountable to its owners (stockholders in the case of for-profits
  and the public with nonprofits). That accountability is accomplished
  by requiring that each corporation has a Board of Directors that
  represents the stockholders or the public.</p>
<p>Members of a governing Board have certain legally required
  (fiduciary) duties, including duties of care, loyalty and obedience
  (some states and countries use different terms -- for example,
  in Canada, the duties of care and loyalty are often stressed).
  For-profit Boards often are referred to as &quot;corporate&quot;
  Boards, which really is a misnomer because both nonprofit and
  for-profit corporations are required to have Boards -- not just
  for-profit corporations.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;Board operations&quot; often refers to the
  activities conducted between Board members and can include development
  and enactment of Board bylaws and other Board policies, recruitment
  of Board members, training and orientation of Board members, organizing
  Board committees, conducting Board meetings, conducting Board
  evaluations, etc. The phrase &quot;governance&quot; often refers
  to the Board's activities to oversee the purpose, plans and policies
  of the overall organization, such as establishing those overall
  plans and policies, supervision of the CEO, ensuring sufficient
  resources for the organization, ensuring compliance to rules and
  regulations, representing the organization to external stakeholders,
  etc. The nature of Board operations and governance depends on
  a variety of factors, including explicit or implicit use of any
  particular Board model, the desired degree of formality among
  Board members and the life-stage of the Board and organization.</p>
<p>Governing Boards can have a variety of models (configurations
  and ways of working), for example, &quot;working Boards&quot;
  (hands-on, or administrative, where Board members might be fixing
  the fax one day and strategic planning the next), &quot;collective&quot;
  (where Board members and others in the organization usually do
  the same types of work -- it's often difficult to discern who
  the Board members actually are), &quot;policy&quot; (where Board
  members attend mostly to top-level policies), &quot;Policy Governance&quot;
  (trademark of Carver Governance Design, where there are very clear
  lines and areas of focus between Board and the CEO), etc. All
  of these models are types of governing Boards.</p>
<p>Boards can have a broad range of &quot;personalities.&quot;
  For example, Boards of large for-profit and nonprofit corporations
  might be very formal in nature with strong attention to Parliamentary
  procedures, highly proceduralized Board operations, etc. In contrast,
  Boards of small nonprofit or for-profit corporations might be
  very informal in nature. Some people believe in life stages of
  Boards, including that they 1) start out as &quot;working&quot;
  Boards where members focus on day-to-day matters in addition to
  strategic matters, 2) evolve to &quot;policy&quot; Boards where
  members focus mostly on strategic matters, and 3) eventually become
  large, institutionalized Boards that often have small executive
  committees and maybe many members some of which are &quot;big
  names&quot; to gain credibility with funders or investors.</p>

<h3>For-Profit (&quot;Corporate&quot;)
  Boards Compared to Nonprofit Boards</h3>
<p>People might be surprised to read that there are more similarities
  between for-profit and nonprofit Boards than there are differences
  -- after all, both types of organizations are required to have
  Boards because both types are corporations, thereby having similar
  fiduciary responsibilities among members. Members of both types
  of Boards must attend to the many activities involved in Board
  operations and governance. Both types of organizations must conform
  to rules and regulations for operations of corporations within
  their states/provinces and countries, including for employment
  laws and tax filings (each type of organization files different
  types of federal tax forms). Thus, many of the topics included
  throughout this overall Library topic on Boards are relevant to
  both types of organizations.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are differences. For-profit Board members
  often are paid, whereas nonprofit Board members usually are not
  (except to be reimbursed for expenses). For-profit Board members
  uniquely attend to decisions about dispersing profits to owners
  (to stockholders), for example, in the form of stock equity and
  dividends, whereas nonprofit Board members do not seek to maximize
  and disperse profits to the owners -- the owners of nonprofits
  are members of the public. Nonprofit Board members often must
  participate in robust fundraising by soliciting funds from individuals,
  foundations, corporations and government entities. Nonprofits
  corporations often enjoy certain tax advantages, including tax-exemption
  (being able to avoid payment of certain taxes) and charitableness
  (so donors can deduct donations from their taxes). To retain that
  charitable tax status, Board and staff members of nonprofits must
  refrain from exceeding certain limits of lobbying and self-dealing.</p>
