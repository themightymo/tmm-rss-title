<h2>To Increase Attendance and/or Participation in Committees</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure committee chairs understand and can convey the role of the committee 
    to members, and that the chair and members have up-to-date job descriptions.</li>
  <li> Ensure adequate orientation that describes the organization and its unique 
    services, and how the committee contributes to this mission. </li>
  <li>Remember that the organization and its committees deserve strong attendance 
    and participation. Don't fall prey to the perspective that &quot;we're lucky 
    just get anyone.&quot; Set a standard for the best.</li>
  <li> Have ground rules that support participation and attendance. Revisit the 
    ground rules every other meeting and post them on the bottom of agendas.</li>
  <li> Let go of &quot;dead wood.&quot; It often help to decrease the number of 
    committee members rather than increase them. </li>
  <li>Consider using subcommittees to increase individual responsibilities and 
    focus on goals.</li>
  <li> Conduct yearly committee evaluations that includes a clear evaluation process 
    and where each committee member evaluates the other members, and each member 
    receives a written report about their strengths and how they can improve their 
    contributions.</li>
  <li> Attempt to provide individual assignments to the committee members.</li>
  <li> Have at least one staff member participate in each committee to help with 
    administrative support and providing information.</li>
  <li> Monitor quorum requirements for the entire board (as set forth usually 
    in ByLaws), or the minimum number of board members who must be present for 
    the board to officially enact business. This quorum, when not met, will serve 
    as a clear indicator, or signal, that the board is in trouble.</li>
  <li> Develop a committee attendance policy that specifies the number of times 
    a member can be absent in consecutive meetings and in total meetings per time 
    period.</li>
  <li> Generate minutes for each committee meeting to get closure on items and 
    help members comprehend the progress made by the committee.</li>
  <li> In committee meeting reports, include noting who is present and who is 
    absent.</li>
  <li> Consider having low-attendance members involved in some other form of service 
    to the organization, e.g., a &quot;friends of the organization,&quot; or something 
    like that, who attends to special events rather than ongoing activities.</li>
  <li> Have a &quot;summit meeting&quot; with committee members to discuss the 
    low attendance problem, and use a round-table approach so each person must 
    speak up with their opinions.</li>
  <li> Rotate in new members every year.</li>
</ul>
