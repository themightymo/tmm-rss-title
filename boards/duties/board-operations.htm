<h3>Recurring, Annual Operations</h3>

<p>Boards meet their responsibilities usually by conducting certain
major activities at certain times of the year. Often, the bylaws
specify when certain activities will be conducted. Activities
include, for example, conducting regular Board meetings (every
month, two months, etc.), conducting the Board self-evaluation,
evaluating the chief executive, reviewing and updating Board and
personnel policies, conducting strategic planning, recruiting
new members, holding an annual meeting, reviewing and authorizing
the yearly budget, conducting fundraising (in the case of nonprofits),
etc. The following sample Board Operations Calendar lists typical
recurring activities of the Board and suggests the timing for
these activities. <br />

<h3>Overall &quot;System&quot; of Board
Operations</h3>

<p>Below, in the links about systems, are handy one-page depictions
of the various inputs to the operations of a Board, the Board
processes that influence those inputs, and the various outputs
from Board operations. This information gives a concise &quot;snapshot&quot;
of the recurring activities -- the loop of activities -- in a
Board. The links about where Boards &quot;fit&quot; are to one-page
depictions that indicate the role of the Board in the overall
planning, development, operations and evaluations in the organization.</p>
