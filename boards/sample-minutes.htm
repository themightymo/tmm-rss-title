<h1>Basic Sample of Board of Directors Meeting Minutes</h1>

<h2><b>Description of Minutes (a sample report of minutes is included later in 
  this document)</b></h2>
<p>The following sample agenda represents typical format and content of a board 
  meeting minutes report. This sample should be customized to the particular culture 
  and purpose of the organization. Note that board meeting minutes are very important. 
  Minutes are considered legal documents by the auditors, IRS and courts, and 
  they represent the actions of the board. Many assert that if it's not in the 
  minutes, it didn't happen.</p>

<p>There is no standardized level of content and format for board
minutes. In courts, as important as what you did is that you were
reasonable when you did it. Therefore, sufficient information
should be included to describe how board members reasonably came
to reasonable decisions.</p>

<p>Include the name of the organization, date and time of meeting,
who called it to order, who attended and if there a quorum, all
motions made, any conflicts of interest or abstainments from voting,
when the meeting ended and who developed the minutes.</p>

<p>The secretary of the board usually takes minutes during meetings.
Written minutes are distributed to board members before each meeting
for member's review. Minutes for the previous meeting should be
reviewed right away in the next meeting. Any changes should be
amended to the minutes and a new version submitted before the
next meeting where the new version is reviewed to be accepted.
Minutes should be retained in a manual and shared with all board
members.<br /></p>

<b>Proceedings:</b><br />
&middot; <i>Meeting called to order</i> at 7:00 p.m. by Chair,
Elizabeth Drucker<br />
&middot; (Last month's) meeting minutes were amended and approved<br />
<br />
<i>&middot; Chief Executive's Report:</i><br />
- Recommends that if we not able to find a new facility by the
end of this month, the organization should stay where in the current
location over the winter. After brief discussion, Board agreed.<br />
- Staff member, Jackson Browne, and Swanson attended the National
Practitioner's Network meeting in Atlanta last month and gave
a brief extemporaneous presentation. Both are invited back next
year to give a longer presentation about our organization. After
brief discussion, Board congratulated Swanson and asked her to
pass on their congratulations to Browne as well.<br />
- Drucker asserts that our organization must ensure its name is
associated with whatever materials are distributed at that practitioner's
meeting next year. The organization should generate revenues where
possible from the materials, too.<br />
- Swanson mentioned that staff member, Sheila Anderson's husband
is ill and in the hospital. MOTION to send a gift to Anderson's
husband, expressing the organization's sympathy and support; seconded
and passed.<br />
<br />
<i>&middot; Finance Committee report</i> provided by Chair, Elizabeth
Drucker:<br />
- Drucker explained that consultant, Susan Johns, reviewed the
organization's bookkeeping procedures and found them to be satisfactory,
in preparation for the upcoming yearly financial audit. Funds
recommends that our company ensure the auditor provides a management
letter along with the audit financial report. <br />
&middot; - Drucker reviewed highlights, trends and issues from
the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. Issues
include that high accounts receivables require Finance Committee
attention to policies and procedures to ensure our organization
receives more payments on time. After brief discussion of the
issues and suggestions about how to ensure receiving payments
on time, MOTION to accept financial statements; seconded and passed.<br />
<br />
&middot; Bo<i>ard Development Committee's report</i> provided
by Chair, Douglas Carver: <br />
- Carver reminded the Board of the scheduled retreat coming up
in three months, and provided a drafted retreat schedule for board
review. MOTION to accept the retreat agenda; seconded and passed.
<br />
- Carver presented members with a draft of the reworded By-laws
paragraph that would allow members to conduct actions over electronic
mail. Carver suggested review and a resolution to change the By-laws
accordingly. Kyumoto suggested that Swanson first seek legal counsel
to verify if the proposed change is consistent with state statute.
Swanson agreed to accept this action and notify members of the
outcome in the next Board meeting. <br />
<br />
&middot; <i>Other business:</i><br />
- Porter noted that he was working with staff member, Jacob Smith,
to help develop an information management systems plan, and that
two weeks ago he (Porter) had mailed members three resumes from
consultants to help with the plan. In the mailing, Porter asked
members for their opinions to help select a consultant. Porter
asked members for their opinions. (NOTE: Zevon noted that she
was also a computer consultant and was concerned about conflict
of interest in her Board role regarding this selection, and asked
to be ABSTAINED from this selection. Members agreed.) The majority
of members agreed on Lease-or-Buy Consultants. MOTION to use Lease-or-Buy
Consultants; seconded and passed.<br />
- Swanson announced that she had recently hired a new secretary,
Karla Writewell.<br />
<br />
&middot; <i>Assessment of the Meeting:</i><br />
- Kyumoto noted that the past three meetings have run over the
intended two-hour time slot by half an hour. He asked members
to be more mindful and focused during discussions, and suggested
that the Board Development Chair take an action to identify solutions
to this issue. Chair, Carver, agreed.<br />
<br />
&middot; Meeting adjourned at 9:30 p.m.<br />
&middot; Minutes submitted by Secretary, Bhata Bhatacharia.</p>
