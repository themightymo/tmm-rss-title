<h3>Board Models</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Board members often adopt a model or way
of working together. Many times, the model is not intentionally
or explicitly selected by Board members. They just ended up working
together in the same way. There are several types of Board models
and others are emerging; however, the research is not conclusive
about which models are best to use and when. Perhaps the most
valuable result for Board members from reading about models is
first learning the many ways that members can work together and
then by reflecting on their own Board operations.</p>

<h3>Board Development (Types Issues, Approaches to Improve, Policy
Governance)</h3>

<p>It might help the reader to understand the concept of Board
development by comparing it to Board orientation and Board training.
Here's one interpretation. Board orientation is orienting Board
members about the unique aspects of the organization, for example,
its history, products and services, other Board members, etc.
Board training is training members about the standard roles and
responsibilities of members of any governing Board. In contrast,
Board development is raising the quality of Board operations up
another level, including, for example, by using a Board pre-assessment,
Board orientation, Board training, coaching of Board members,
and closing with a Board post-assessment to measure any improvement
from the Board development. The following links provide a range
of advice about improving the quality of Board operations. HOWEVER,
reading guidelines about fixing Boards, without knowing the basic
parts and best practices of Boards, is like reading about fixing
a car, but without knowing the basic parts of a car. Therefore,
the reader is strongly encouraged to at least scan through the
list of topics in the table at the top this page before reading
many of the links about struggling Boards and how to &quot;fix&quot;
Boards.</p>
