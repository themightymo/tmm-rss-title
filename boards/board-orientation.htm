<h3>Orientation and Agenda</h3>

<p>Board training conveys the knowledge and understanding needed
in order to be effective as a member of any governing Board of
Directors, for example, legal responsibilities. Board orientation
is training about the organization-specific information in order
to be effective particularly as a member of the organization's
Board of Directors, for example, about where the Board meets,
who's on the Board now, etc. Selection of training topics and
training methods depend on the nature and needs of the organization.
However, the following guidelines and sample training agenda might
serve useful to the reader when designing their own training plan
and methods.</p>
