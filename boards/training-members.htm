<p>Board training conveys the knowledge and understanding needed
by board members in order to effectively carry out their roles
as members of the organization's board of directors. Selection
of the particular training topics and training methods depend
on the nature and needs of the organization. However, the following
guidelines and sample agenda may prove useful to readers as they
develop their own approach to board training.</p>

<h2><a name="add" id="add"></a>Guidelines to Prepare Board Training</h2>
<h3>Regarding Timing of the Session</h3>
<p>1. Conduct board training once a year, whether you have
new board members or not. It's amazing how the &quot;basics&quot;
helps to ground and integrate the knowledge and understanding
of even highly experienced board members. Recurring training also
helps to ensure that board members are all &quot;working from
the same script&quot;.</p>

<p>2. Conduct board training shortly after new members are elected
to the board. This scheduling helps new members quickly gain understanding
of their roles and contributions to the organization. This understanding
often increases their participation and fulfillment regarding
their roles as board members.</p>

<h3>Who Should Be Involved in Planning the Session</h3>
<p>
3. Design of the board training should include at least
the chief executive officer and board chair. Ideally, the organization
also has a board development committee whose chair can provide
strong participation in the training. If timing permits, discuss
ideas with all board members to collect their feedback and review.</p>

<h3>Selecting Topics and Materials for Board Training</h3>
<p>
4. Results of the board self-evaluation should be carefully
considered when selecting training topics. For example, if the
evaluation indicated the board members don't understand their
roles as board members, then ensure that training places strong
focus on this topic during training.</p>

<p>5. Be sure to include review of the board manual in the training
session. The manual is the key resource for members to collect,
organize and reference resources needed to carry out their roles
as board member. Members should take seriously their manual and
the use of it.</p>

<p>6. Materials you'll need often include: <br />
a) Board manual (for an idea of contents to include in the manual,
see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/manual.htm">Sample Board Manual Index</a>)<br />
b) Advertising and promotions materials about the organization
and its programs<br />
c) Copy of the most recent strategic plan</p>

<h3>Members' Preparation for Training</h3>
<p>
7. Provide the board training agenda, board manual and
promotions materials to members at least two weeks before the
meeting. Ask them to review the materials before the meeting.</p>

<p>NOTE: Many of the materials you may need for training and to
present to members are included in the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm">Free
Toolkit for Boards</a> in the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org">Free
Management Library</a>. <br />
