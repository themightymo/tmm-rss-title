<h2>Overall
Benefit of an Advisory Group</h2>

Driving forces such as increased
global telecommunications, public consciousness and diverse values
are causing rapid change among organizations like never before.
Consequently, the overall role of board governance becomes very
critical in guiding these organizations during rapid change. Thus,
an advisory group can be a tremendous complement to the effectiveness
of the official, or formal, board of directors as it works to
carry out a specific, complex, major role (eg, financial analysis)
or initiative (eg, construct a building).
</p>

<h2>What
is an Advisory Group?</h2>

An advisory group is a collection
of individuals who bring unique knowledge and skills which complement
the knowledge and skills of the formal board members in order
to more effectively govern the organization.
</p>

<p>Advisory groups are sometimes used,
too, to provide membership which gives status to people, for example,
retired CEOs, board chairs or major contributors.
</p>

<p>The advisory group does not have formal
authority to govern the organization, that is, the advisory cannot
issue directives which must be followed. Rather, the advisory
group serves to make recommendations and/or provide key information
and materials to the formal board of directors.
</p>

<p>The advisory group can be standing
(or ongoing) or ad hoc (one-time) in nature.
</p>

<p>

<h2>When
Should an Advisory Group Be Formed?</h2>

Consider establishing an advisory
group when it's apparent that a major, current issue/challenge
or complex program/product/service is too complex and/or numerous
to be handled by the formal board of directors.
</p>

<p>It's best if the advisory group is
formed to address a need that is usually outside the usual, ongoing
roles and responsibilities of a formal board. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/committees.htm">Typical
Types of Committees</a>.) Otherwise, it may be more prudent to
more fully equip and develop the formal board of directors.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor705744"></a>
<h2>How
Should the Advisory Group Be Defined/Organized?</h2>
For ongoing, major activities
(for example, that will last longer than a year) establish a standing
advisory group. For short-term activities (for example, one to
nine months), establish an ad hoc advisory group.
</p>

<p>Carefully define the role of the advisory
group in the formal board of directors' by-laws.
</p>

<p>In the by-laws, specify the advisory
group's purpose, duration, guidelines for membership, how it contributes
knowledge and skills, and any structures/policies from which the
advisory group interacts with the formal board of directors and
organization members.
</p>

<p>Advisory group, like formal boards
of directors, should have a chair who drives organization and
development of the advisory group. The advisory group chair should
be the point of contact between the advisory group and the formal
board of directors.
