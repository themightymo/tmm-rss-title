<h1>Evaluating the Board and Members</h1>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter

<p>One of the most powerful practices for Board members is to
evaluate the quality of their Board operations. Many times, Board
members do not know what they do not know about their own Board.
For example, they might be terribly ineffective because they all
have fallen into a rut in their operations -- and they have not
even realized it. Or, they might have gotten side-tracked into
attending to certain urgent matters (for example, the latest crisis
reported by the Chief Executive Officer), and are ignoring very
important matters (for example, strategic planning that would
have avoided those crises altogether).</p>

<p>Board members who claim that they do not need evaluation and
Board training are like obese people who claim that they do not
need advice about eating because, after all, they are already
experts at eating. Experienced and highly effective Board members
have learned that it's critical to regularly conduct short, practical
evaluations of the quality of their Board operations and then
to attend to the results of those evaluations during the year.
Evaluations need not take a long time -- many times, even 15 minutes
a year from each Board member to complete a short questionnaire,
followed by half an hour to discuss results, can be transformational
for a Board.</p>

<p>Here are a variety of free Board self-evaluation tools. Aim
to select a tool that asks at least as much about the actual occurrence
of activities on your Board as about how members feel about the
Board. It's good practice to have a small team of Board members
review and select the best tool. It's often best if each Board
member completes a tool on his/her own, rather than together in
a group. Also, the best time to do a Board evaluation is now.
Don't wait until new members have learned more about the Board
-- that's like waiting until you feel fine before seeing the doctor.
Keep in mind that Board members of nonprofits are volunteers and
their time is often very limited, so pick a tool that Board members
will even have enough time to complete.</p>
