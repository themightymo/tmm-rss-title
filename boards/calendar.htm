<p>The following calendar can be reviewed by an organization to
modify according to their own nature and needs. The following
calendar should be updated yearly and provided to each board member
and the chief executive.</p>

<p>NOTE #1: There are certain one-time activities that the board
should conduct during the startup of the organization. See the
list <a class="textlink" href="#anchor1773454">Startup Activities List</a> at the
end of this document.</p>

<p>NOTE #2: There are also certain activities that recur in each
regular board meeting. Regular board meetings might be held once
a month, every two months, once every three months, etc. To get
a sense for the activities that occur in these meetings, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/meeting-agenda.htm">Sample Meeting Agenda</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/sample-minutes.htm">Sample
Meeting Minutes.</a>
</p>

<p>NOTE #3: The timing for each of the following activities should
be relative to the timing of the beginning of the fiscal year.
In the following sample table, the fiscal year begins January

<h2>Startup
Activities List (to start the organization)</h2>

When forming a  new corporation or association (these
are the types of organizations that usually have boards of directors),
the board typically has several specific activities they must
conduct, including meeting to:<br />
1. Approve the mission statement (may include vision and values
statements, as well)<br />
2. Approve Articles of Incorporation (or whatever charter document
is required in your state)<br />
3. Approve Bylaws (these are not always required in every state;
you should strongly consider having them anyway)<br />
4. Select officers in the board (usually including the president
or chair, vice president or vice chair, secretary and treasurer)<br />
5. Approve (probably <i>very rough drafts of the</i>) strategic
plan and yearly budget</p>
