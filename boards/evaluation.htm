<h1>Board of Directors
Self-Evaluation</h1>

<p>The following table can be used by all board members and the
chief executive to get an impression of how well the board is
doing. The table is a rather basic form for board evaluation.
But, if the evaluation is conducted wholeheartedly, the form should
indicate how the board is generally doing in conducting its role.</p>

<p>Each member and the chief executive should complete the form
about four weeks before a board retreat. Members attach suggestions
about how the board could get higher ratings for any or all of
the following 14 considerations.</p>

<p>Ideally, someone outside the organization receives the completed
forms, collates the results and write a report indicating the
number of respondents who rated the board for each of the 12 considerations.</p>
