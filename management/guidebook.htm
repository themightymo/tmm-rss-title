<h2>=== INTRO TO MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor1012225"></a></p>

<h2>What is &quot;Management&quot;? What Do Managers Do?</h2>

<h3>What is &quot;Management&quot;?</h3>

<h4>Traditional Interpretation</h4>

<p>There are a variety of views about this term. Traditionally,
the term &quot;management&quot; refers to the set of activities,
and often the group of people, involved in four general functions,
including planning, organizing, leading and coordinating activities.
(Note that the four functions recur throughout the organization
and are highly integrated.)</p>

<h4>Another Interpretation</h4>

<p>Some writers, teachers and practitioners assert that the above
view is rather outmoded and that management needs to focus more
on leadership skills, e.g., establishing vision and goals, communicating
the vision and goals, and guiding others to accomplish them. They
also assert that leadership must be more facilitative, participative
and empowering in how visions and goals are established and carried
out. Some people assert that this really isn't a change in the
management functions, rather it's re-emphasizing certain aspects
of management.</p>

<h3>What Do Managers Do?</h3>

<p>Both of the above interpretations acknowledge the major functions
of planning, organizing, leading and coordinating activities --
they put different emphasis and suggest different natures of activities
in the following four major functions. They still agree that what
managers do is the following:</p>

<h4>1. Planning</h4>

<p>including identifying goals, objectives, methods, resources
needed to carry out methods, responsibilities and dates for completion
of tasks. Examples of planning are strategic planning, business
planning, project planning, staffing planning, advertising and
promotions planning, etc.</p>

<h4>2. Organizing resources</h4>

<p>to achieve the goals in an optimum fashion. Examples are organizing
new departments, human resources, office and file systems, re-organizing
businesses, etc.</p>

<h4>3. Leading</h4>

<p>Including to set direction for the organization, groups and
individuals and also influence people to follow that direction.
Examples are establishing strategic direction (vision, values,
mission and / or goals) and championing methods of organizational
performance management to pursue that direction.</p>

<h4>4. Controlling, or Coordinating</h4>

<p>This occurs with the organization's systems, processes and
structures to effectively and efficiently reach goals and objectives.
This includes ongoing collection of feedback, and monitoring and
adjustment of systems, processes and structures accordingly. Examples
include use of financial controls, policies and procedures, performance
management processes, measures to avoid risks etc.</p>

<p>Another common view is that &quot;management&quot; is getting
things done through others. Yet another view, quite apart from
the traditional view, asserts that the job of management is to
support employee's efforts to be fully productive members of the
organizations and citizens of the community.</p>

<p>To most employees, the term &quot;management&quot; probably
means the group of people (executives and other managers) who
are primarily responsible for making decisions in the organization.
In a nonprofit, the term &quot;management&quot; might refer to
all or any of the activities of the board, executive director
and/or program directors.</p>

<h2>What is &quot;Supervision&quot;? What Do Supervisors Do?</h2>

<h3>What is &quot;Supervision&quot;?</h3>

<p>There are several interpretations of the term &quot;supervision&quot;,
but typically supervision is the activity carried out by supervisors
to oversee the productivity and progress of employees who report
directly to the supervisors. For example, first-level supervisors
supervise entry-level employees. Depending on the size of the
organization, middle-managers supervise first-level supervisors,
chief executives supervise middle-managers, etc. Supervision is
a management activity and supervisors have a management role in
the organization.</p>

<h3>What Do Supervisors Do?</h3>

<p>Supervision of a group of employees often includes <br />
1. Conducting basic management skills (decision making, problem
solving, planning, delegation and meeting management)<br />
2. Organizing their department and teams<br />
3. Noticing the need for and designing new job roles in the group<br />
4. Hiring new employees<br />
5. Training new employees <br />
6. Employee performance management (setting goals, observing and
giving feedback, addressing performance issues, firing employees,
etc.)<br />
7. Conforming to personnel policies and other internal regulations</p>

<h2>=== CORE SKILLS IN MANAGEMENT &amp; SUPERVISION ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor227589"></a></p>

<h2>Problem Solving and Decision Making</h2>

<p>Much of what managers and supervisors do is solve problems
and make decisions. New managers and supervisors, in particular,
often solve problems and decisions by reacting to them. They are
&quot;under the gun&quot;, stressed and very short for time. Consequently,
when they encounter a new problem or decision they must make,
they react with a decision that seemed to work before. It's easy
with this approach to get stuck in a circle of solving the same
problem over and over again. Therefore, as a new manager or supervisor,
get used to an organized approach to problem solving and decision
making. Not all problems can be solved and decisions made by the
following, rather rational approach. However, the following basic
guidelines will get you started. Don't be intimidated by the length
of the list of guidelines. After you've practiced them a few times,
they'll become second nature to you -- enough that you can deepen
and enrich them to suit your own needs and nature.</p>

<p>(Note that it might be more your nature to view a &quot;problem&quot;
as an &quot;opportunity&quot;. Therefore, you might substitute
&quot;opportunity&quot; for &quot;problem&quot; in the following
guidelines.)</p>

<h3>1. Define the problem</h3>

<p>This is often where people struggle. They react to what they
think the problem is. Instead, seek to understand more about why
you think there's a problem.</p>

<h4>Defining the problem: (with input from yourself and others)</h4>

<p>Ask yourself and others, the following questions: <br />
a. What can you <i>see</i> that causes you to think there's a
problem? <br />
b. Where is it happening?<br />
c. How is it happening?<br />
d. When is it happening?<br />
e. With whom is it happening? (HINT: Don't jump to &quot;Who is
causing the problem?&quot; When we're stressed, blaming is often
one of our first reactions. To be an effective manager, you need
to address issues more than people.)<br />
f. Why is it happening?<br />
g. Write down a five-sentence description of the problem in terms
of &quot;The following should be happening, but isn't ...&quot;
or &quot;The following is happening and should be: ...&quot; As
much as possible, be specific in your description, including what
is happening, where, how, with whom and why. (It may be helpful
at this point to use a variety of research methods. See .</p>

<h4>Defining complex problems:</h4>

<p>a. If the problem still seems overwhelming, break it down by
repeating steps a-f until you have descriptions of several related
problems.</p>

<h4>Verifying your understanding of the problems:</h4>

<p>a. It helps a great deal to verify your problem analysis for
conferring with a peer or someone else.</p>

<h4>Prioritize the problems:</h4>

<p>a. If you discover that you are looking at several related
problems, then prioritize which ones you should address first.
<br />
b. Note the difference between &quot;important&quot; and &quot;urgent&quot;
problems. Often, what we consider to be important problems to
consider are really just urgent problems. Important problems deserve
more attention. For example, if you're continually answering &quot;urgent&quot;
phone calls, then you've probably got a more &quot;important&quot;
problem and that's to design a system that screens and prioritizes
your phone calls.</p>

<h4>Understand your role in the problem:</h4>

<p>a. Your role in the problem can greatly influence how you perceive
the role of others. For example, if you're very stressed out,
it'll probably look like others are, too, or, you may resort too
quickly to blaming and reprimanding others. Or, you are feel very
guilty about your role in the problem, you may ignore the accountabilities
of others.</p>

<h3>2. Look at potential causes for the problem</h3>

<p>a. It's amazing how much you don't know about what you don't
know. Therefore, in this phase, it's critical to get input from
other people who notice the problem and who are effected by it.
<br />
b. It's often useful to collect input from other individuals one
at a time (at least at first). Otherwise, people tend to be inhibited
about offering their impressions of the real causes of problems.<br />
c. Write down what your opinions and what you've heard from others.<br />
d. Regarding what you think might be performance problems associated
with an employee, it's often useful to seek advice from a peer
or your supervisor in order to verify your impression of the problem.<br />
e.Write down a description of the cause of the problem and in
terms of what is happening, where, when, how, with whom and why.</p>

<h3>3. Identify alternatives for approaches to resolve the problem</h3>

<p>a. At this point, it's useful to keep others involved (unless
you're facing a personal and/or employee performance problem).
Brainstorm for solutions to the problem. Very simply put, brainstorming
is collecting as many ideas as possible, then screening them to
find the best idea. It's critical when collecting the ideas to
not pass any judgment on the ideas -- just write them down as
you hear them. (A wonderful set of skills used to identify the
underlying cause of issues is <a href="http://managementhelp.org/systems/index.htm"
class="textlink">Systems Thinking</a>.)</p>

<h3>4. Select an approach to resolve the problem</h3>

<p>When selecting the best approach, consider:<br />
a. Which approach is the most likely to solve the problem for
the long term?<br />
b. Which approach is the most realistic to accomplish for now?
Do you have the resources? Are they affordable? Do you have enough
time to implement the approach?<br />
c. What is the extent of risk associated with each alternative?
<br />
(The nature of this step, in particular, in the problem solving
process is why problem solving and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/problem-solving.htm"
class="textlink">decision making</a> are highly integrated.)</p>

<h3>5. Plan the implementation of the best alternative (this is
your action plan)</h3>

<p>a. Carefully consider &quot;What will the situation look like
when the problem is solved?&quot;<br />
b. What steps should be taken to implement the best alternative
to solving the problem? What systems or processes should be changed
in your organization, for example, a new policy or procedure?
Don't resort to solutions where someone is &quot;just going to
try harder&quot;. <br />
c. How will you know if the steps are being followed or not? (these
are your indicators of the success of your plan)<br />
d. What resources will you need in terms of people, money and
facilities? <br />
e. How much time will you need to implement the solution? Write
a schedule that includes the start and stop times, and when you
expect to see certain indicators of success. <br />
f. Who will primarily be responsible for ensuring implementation
of the plan?<br />
g. Write down the answers to the above questions and consider
this as your action plan.<br />
h. Communicate the plan to those who will involved in implementing
it and, at least, to your immediate supervisor.<br />
(An important aspect of this step in the problem-solving process
is continually observation and feedback.)</p>

<h3>6. Monitor implementation of the plan</h3>

<p>Monitor the indicators of success: <br />
a. Are you seeing what you would expect from the indicators?<br />
b. Will the plan be done according to schedule? <br />
c. If the plan is not being followed as expected, then consider:
Was the plan realistic? Are there sufficient resources to accomplish
the plan on schedule? Should more priority be placed on various
aspects of the plan? Should the plan be changed?</p>

<h3>7. Verify if the problem has been resolved or not</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to verify if a problem has been solved
or not is to resume normal operations in the organization. Still,
you should consider:<br />
a. What changes should be made to avoid this type of problem in
the future? Consider changes to policies and procedures, training,
etc. <br />
b. Lastly, consider &quot;What did you learn from this problem
solving?&quot; Consider new knowledge, understanding and/or skills.
<br />
c. Consider writing a brief memo that highlights the success of
the problem solving effort, and what you learned as a result.
Share it with your supervisor, peers and subordinates.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>

<h3>Quick Look at Some Basic Terms</h3>

<p>Planning typically includes use of the following basic terms.</p>

<p>NOTE: It's not critical to grasp completely accurate definitions
of each of the following terms. It's more important for planners
to have a basic sense for the difference between goals/objectives
(results) and strategies/tasks (methods to achieve the results).</p>

<h4>1. Goals</h4>

<p>Goals are specific accomplishments that must be accomplished
in total, or in some combination, in order to achieve some larger,
overall result preferred from the system, for example, the mission
of an organization. (Going back to our reference to systems, goals
are outputs from the system.)</p>

<h4>2. Strategies or Activities</h4>

<p>These are the methods or processes required in total, or in
some combination, to achieve the goals. (Going back to our reference
to systems, strategies are processes in the system.)</p>

<h4>3. Objectives</h4>

<p>Objectives are specific accomplishments that must be accomplished
in total, or in some combination, to achieve the goals in the
plan. Objectives are usually &quot;milestones&quot; along the
way when implementing the strategies.</p>

<h4>4. Tasks</h4>

<p>Particularly in small organizations, people are assigned various
tasks required to implement the plan. If the scope of the plan
is very small, tasks and activities are often essentially the
same.</p>

<h4>5. Resources (and Budgets)</h4>

<p>Resources include the people, materials, technologies, money,
etc., required to implement the strategies or processes. The costs
of these resources are often depicted in the form of a budget.
(Going back to our reference to systems, resources are input to
the system.)</p>

<h3>Basic Overview of Typical Phases in Planning</h3>

<p>Whether the system is an organization, department, business,
project, etc., the basic planning process typically includes similar
nature of activities carried out in similar sequence. The phases
are carried out carefully or -- in some cases -- intuitively,
for example, when planning a very small, straightforward effort.
The complexity of the various phases (and their duplication throughout
the system) depend on the scope of the system. For example, in
a large corporation, the following phases would be carried out
in the corporate offices, in each division, in each department,
in each group, etc.</p>

<p>NOTE: Different groups of planners might have different names
for the following activities and groups them differently. However,
the nature of the activities and their general sequence remains
the same.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following are typical phases in planning. They do
<i>not</i> comprise the complete, ideal planning process.</p>

<h4>1. Reference Overall Singular Purpose (&quot;Mission&quot;)</h4>

<p>or Desired Result from System<br />
During planning, planners have in mind (consciously or unconsciously)
some overall purpose or result that the plan is to achieve. For
example, during strategic planning, it's critical to reference
the mission, or overall purpose, of the organization.</p>

<h4>2. Take Stock Outside and Inside the System</h4>

<p>This &quot;taking stock&quot; is always done to some extent,
whether consciously or unconsciously. For example, during strategic
planning, it's important to conduct an environmental scan. This
scan usually involves considering various driving forces, or major
influences, that might effect the organization.</p>

<h4>3. Analyze the Situation</h4>

<p>For example, during strategic planning, planners often conduct
a &quot;SWOT analysis&quot;. (SWOT is an acronym for considering
the organization's strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities
and threats faced by the organization.) During this analysis,
planners also can use a variety of assessments, or methods to
&quot;measure&quot; the health of systems.</p>

<h4>4. Establish Goals</h4>

<p>Based on the analysis and alignment to the overall mission
of the system, planners establish a set of goals that build on
strengths to take advantage of opportunities, while building up
weaknesses and warding off threats.</p>

<h4>5. Establish Strategies to Reach Goals</h4>

<p>The particular strategies (or methods to reach the goals) chosen
depend on matters of affordability, practicality and efficiency.</p>

<h4>6. Establish Objectives Along the Way to Achieving Goals</h4>

<p>Objectives are selected to be timely and indicative of progress
toward goals.</p>

<h4>7. Associate Responsibilities and Time Lines With Each Objective</h4>

<p>Responsibilities are assigned, including for implementation
of the plan, and for achieving various goals and objectives. Ideally,
deadlines are set for meeting each responsibility.</p>

<h4>8. Write and Communicate a Plan Document</h4>

<p>The above information is organized and written in a document
which is distributed around the system.</p>

<h4>9. Acknowledge and Celebrate Accomplishment of the Plan</h4>

<p>This step is frequently forgotten, which can lead to increasing
frustration and skepticism on the part of those people who are
responsible to carry out the plan.</p>

<h3>Guidelines to Ensure Successful Planning and Implementation</h3>

<p>A common failure in many kinds of planning is that the plan
is never really implemented. Instead, all focus is on writing
a plan document. Too often, the plan sits collecting dust on a
shelf. Therefore, most of the following guidelines help to ensure
that the planning process is carried out completely and is implemented
completely -- or, deviations from the intended plan are recognized
and managed accordingly.</p>

<h4>1. Involve the Right People in the Planning Process</h4>

<p>Going back to the reference to systems, it's critical that
all parts of the system continue to exchange feedback in order
to function effectively. This is true no matter what type of system.
When planning, get input from everyone who will responsible to
carry out parts of the plan, along with representative from groups
who will be effected by the plan. Of course, people also should
be involved if they will be responsible to review and authorize
the plan.</p>

<h4>2. Write Down the Planning Information and Communicate it
Widely</h4>

<p>New managers, in particular, often forget that others don't
know what these managers know. Even if managers do communicate
their intentions and plans verbally, chances are great that others
won't completely hear or understand what the manager wants done.
Also, as plans change, it's extremely difficult to remember who
is supposed to be doing what and according to which version of
the plan. Key stakeholders (employees, management, board members,
funders, investor, customers, clients, etc.) may request copies
of various types of plans. Therefore, it's critical to write plans
down and communicate them widely.</p>

<p><a name="anchor155743"></a></p>

<h4>3. Goals and Objectives Should Be SMARTER</h4>

<p>SMARTER is an acronym, that is, a word composed by joining
letters from different words in a phrase or set of words. In this
case, a SMARTER goal or objective is:</p>

<p><i>Specific: <br /></i>
For example, it's difficult to know what someone should be
doing if they are to pursue the goal to &quot;work harder&quot;.
It's easier to recognize &quot;Write a paper&quot;.</p>

<p><i>Measurable: <br /></i>
It's difficult to know what the scope of &quot;Writing a paper&quot;
really is. It's easier to appreciate that effort if the goal is
&quot;Write a 30-page paper&quot;.</p>

<p><i>Acceptable: <br /></i>
If I'm to take responsibility for pursuit of a goal, the goal
should be acceptable to me. For example, I'm not likely to follow
the directions of someone telling me to write a 30-page paper
when I also have to five other papers to write. However, if you
involve me in setting the goal so I can change my other commitments
or modify the goal, I'm much more likely to accept pursuit of
the goal as well.</p>

<p><i>Realistic: <br /></i>
Even if I do accept responsibility to pursue a goal that is
specific and measurable, the goal won't be useful to me or others
if, for example, the goal is to &quot;Write a 30-page paper in
the next 10 seconds&quot;.</p>

<p><i>Time frame: <br /></i>
It may mean more to others if I commit to a realistic goal
to &quot;Write a 30-page paper in one week&quot;. However, it'll
mean more to others (particularly if they are planning to help
me or guide me to reach the goal) if I specify that I will write
one page a day for 30 days, rather than including the possibility
that I will write all 30 pages in last day of the 30-day period.</p>

<p><i>Extending:<br /></i>
The goal should stretch the performer's capabilities. For
example, I might be more interested in writing a 30-page paper
if the topic of the paper or the way that I write it will extend
my capabilities.</p>

<p><i>Rewarding: <br /></i>
I'm more inclined to write the paper if the paper will contribute
to an effort in such a way that I might be rewarded for my effort.</p>

<h4>4. Build in Accountability (Regularly Review Who's Doing What
and By When?)</h4>

<p>Plans should specify who is responsible for achieving each
result, including goals and objectives. Dates should be set for
completion of each result, as well. Responsible parties should
regularly review status of the plan. Be sure to have someone of
authority &quot;sign off&quot; on the plan, including putting
their signature on the plan to indicate they agree with and support
its contents. Include responsibilities in policies, procedures,
job descriptions, performance review processes, etc.</p>

<h4>5. Note Deviations from the Plan and Replan Accordingly</h4>

<p>It's OK to deviate from the plan. The plan is not a set of
rules. It's an overall guideline. As important as following the
plan is noticing deviations and adjusting the plan accordingly.</p>

<h4>6. Evaluate Planning Process and the Plan</h4>

<p>During the planning process, regularly collect feedback from
participants. Do they agree with the planning process? If not,
what don't they like and how could it be done better? In large,
ongoing planning processes (such as strategic planning, business
planning, project planning, etc.), it's critical to collect this
kind of feedback regularly.</p>

<p>During regular reviews of implementation of the plan, assess
if goals are being achieved or not. If not, were goals realistic?
Do responsible parties have the resources necessary to achieve
the goals and objectives? Should goals be changed? Should more
priority be placed on achieving the goals? What needs to be done?</p>

<p>Finally, take 10 minutes to write down how the planning process
could have been done better. File it away and read it the next
time you conduct the planning process.</p>

<h4>7. Recurring Planning Process is at Least as Important as
Plan Document</h4>

<p>Far too often, primary emphasis is placed on the plan document.
This is extremely unfortunate because the real treasure of planning
is the planning process itself. During planning, planners learn
a great deal from ongoing analysis, reflection, discussion, debates
and dialogue around issues and goals in the system. Perhaps there
is no better example of misplaced priorities in planning than
in business ethics. Far too often, people put emphasis on written
codes of ethics and codes of conduct. While these documents certainly
are important, at least as important is conducting ongoing communications
around these documents. The ongoing communications are what sensitize
people to understanding and following the values and behaviors
suggested in the codes.</p>

<h4>8. Nature of the Process Should Be Compatible to Nature of
Planners</h4>

<p>A prominent example of this type of potential problem is when
planners don't prefer the &quot;top down&quot; or &quot;bottom
up&quot;, &quot;linear&quot; type of planning (for example, going
from general to specific along the process of an environmental
scan, SWOT analysis, mission/vision/values, issues and goals,
strategies, objectives, timelines, etc.) There are other ways
to conduct planning.</p>

<h4>9. Critical -- But Frequently Missing Step -- Acknowledgement
and Celebration of Results</h4>

<p>It's easy for planners to become tired and even cynical about
the planning process. One of the reasons for this problem is very
likely that far too often, emphasis is placed on achieving the
results. Once the desired results are achieved, new ones are quickly
established. The process can seem like having to solve one problem
after another, with no real end in sight. Yet when one really
thinks about it, it's a major accomplishment to carefully analyze
a situation, involve others in a plan to do something about it,
work together to carry out the plan and actually see some results.
So acknowledge this -- celebrate your accomplishment!</p>

<h2>Effective Delegation</h2>

<p>The hallmark of good supervision is effective delegation. Delegation
is when supervisors give responsibility and authority to subordinates
to complete a task, and let the subordinates figure out how the
task can be accomplished. Effective delegation develops people
who are ultimately more fulfilled and productive. Managers become
more fulfilled and productive themselves as they learn to count
on their staffs and are freed up to attend to more strategic issues.</p>

<p>Delegation is often very difficult for new supervisors, particularly
if they have had to scramble to start the organization or start
a major new product or service themselves. Many managers want
to remain comfortable, making the same decisions they have always
made. They believe they can do a better job themselves. They don't
want to risk losing any of their power and stature (ironically,
they do lose these if they don't learn to delegate effectively).
Often, they don't want to risk giving authority to subordinates
in case they fail and impair the organization.</p>

<p>However, there are basic approaches to delegation that, with
practice, become the backbone of effective supervision and development.
Thomas R. Horton, in <i>Delegation and Team Building: No Solo
Acts Please</i> (Management Review, September 1992, pp. 58-61)
suggests the following general steps to accomplish delegation:</p>

<p>1. <b>Delegate the whole task to one person</b><br />
This gives the person the responsibility and increases their motivation.</p>

<p>2. <b>Select the right person</b><br />
Assess the skills and capabilities of subordinates and assign
the task to the most appropriate one.</p>

<p>3. <b>Clearly specify your preferred results</b><br />
Give information on what, why, when, who and where. You might
leave the &quot;how&quot; to them. Write this information down.</p>

<p>4. <b>Delegate responsibility and authority -- assign the task,
not the method to accomplish it</b><br />
Let the subordinate complete the task in the manner they choose,
as long as the results are what the supervisor specifies. Let
the employee have strong input as to the completion date of the
project. Note that you may not even know how to complete the task
yourself -- this is often the case with higher levels of management.</p>

<p>5. <b>Ask the employee to summarize back to you, their impressions
of the project and the results you prefer</b></p>

<p>6. <b>Get ongoing non-intrusive feedback about progress on
the project</b><br />
This is a good reason to continue to get weekly, written status
reports from all direct reports. Reports should cover what they
did last week, plan to do next week and any potential issues.
Regular employee meetings provide this ongoing feedback, as well.</p>

<p>7. <b>Maintain open lines of communication</b><br />
Don't hover over the subordinate, but sense what they're doing
and support their checking in with you along the way.</p>

<p>8. <b>If you're not satisfied with the progress, don't take
the project back</b><br />
Continue to work with the employee and ensure they perceive the
project as their responsibility.</p>

<p>9. <b>Evaluate and reward performance</b><br />
Evaluate results more than methods. Address insufficient performance
and reward successes. See the next major section, &quot;Employee
Performance Management.&quot;</p>

<h2>Basics of Internal Communications</h2>

<p>Effective communications is the &quot;life's blood&quot; of
an organization. Organizations that are highly successful have
strong communications. One of the first signs that an organization
is struggling is that communications have broken down. The following
guidelines are very basic in nature, but comprise the basics for
ensuring strong ongoing, internal communications.</p>

<p>1. <b>Have all employees provide weekly written status reports
to their supervisors</b><br />
Include what tasks were done last week, what tasks are planned
next week, any pending issues and date the report. These reports
may seem a tedious task, but they're precious in ensuring that
the employee and their supervisor have mutual understanding of
what is going on, and the reports come in very handy for planning
purposes. They also make otherwise harried employees stand back
and reflect on what they're doing.</p>

<p>2. <b>Hold monthly meetings with all employees together</b><br />
Review the overall condition of the organization and review recent
successes. Consider conducting &quot;in service&quot; training
where employees take turns describing their roles to the rest
of the staff. For clarity, focus and morale, be sure to use agendas
and ensure follow-up minutes. Consider bringing in a customer
to tell their story of how the organization helped them. These
meetings go a long way toward building a feeling of teamwork among
staff.</p>

<p>3. <b>Hold weekly or biweekly meetings with all employees together
if the organization is small (e.g., under 10 people); otherwise,
with all managers together</b><br />
Have these meetings even if there is not a specific problem to
solve -- just make them shorter. (Holding meetings only when there
are problems to solve cultivates a crisis-oriented environment
where managers believe their only job is to solve problems.) Use
these meetings for each person to briefly give an overview of
what they are doing that week. Facilitate the meetings to support
exchange of ideas and questions. Again, for clarity, focus and
morale, be sure to use agendas, take minutes and ensure follow-up
minutes. Have each person bring their calendar to ensure scheduling
of future meetings accommodates each person's calendar.</p>

<p>4. <b>Have supervisors meet with their direct reports in one-on-one
meetings every month</b><br />
This ultimately produces more efficient time management and supervision.
Review overall status of work activities, hear how it's going
with both the supervisor and the employee, exchange feedback and
questions about current products and services, and discuss career
planning, etc. Consider these meetings as interim meetings between
the more formal, yearly performance review meetings.</p>

<h2>Meeting Management</h2>

<p>Meeting management tends to be a set of skills often overlooked
by leaders and managers. The following information is a rather
&quot;Cadillac&quot; version of meeting management suggestions.
The reader might pick which suggestions best fits the particular
culture of their own organization. Keep in mind that meetings
are very expensive activities when one considers the cost of labor
for the meeting and how much can or cannot get done in them. So
take meeting management very seriously.</p>

<p>The process used in a meeting depends on the kind of meeting
you plan to have, e.g., staff meeting, planning meeting, problem
solving meeting, etc. However, there are certain basics that are
common to various types of meetings. These basics are described
below.</p>

<p>(Note that there may seem to be a lot of suggestions listed
below for something as apparently simple as having a meeting.
However, any important activity would include a long list of suggestions.
The list seems to become much smaller once you master how to conduct
the activity.)</p>

<h3>Selecting Participants</h3>

<p>1. The decision about who is to attend depends on what you
want to accomplish in the meeting. This may seem too obvious to
state, but it's surprising how many meetings occur without the
right people there.<br />
2. Don't depend on your own judgment about who should come. Ask
several other people for their opinion as well.<br />
3. If possible, call each person to tell them about the meeting,
it's overall purpose and why their attendance is important.<br />
4. Follow-up your call with a meeting notice, including the purpose
of the meeting, where it will be held and when, the list of participants
and whom to contact if they have questions.<br />
5. Send out a copy of the proposed agenda along with the meeting
notice.<br />
6. Have someone designated to record important actions, assignments
and due dates during the meeting. This person should ensure that
this information is distributed to all participants shortly after
the meeting.</p>

<h3>Developing Agendas</h3>

<p>1. Develop the agenda together with key participants in the
meeting. Think of what overall outcome you want from the meeting
and what activities need to occur to reach that outcome. The agenda
should be organized so that these activities are conducted during
the meeting. <br />
In the agenda, state the overall outcome that you want from the
meeting<br />
2. Design the agenda so that participants get involved early by
having something for them to do right away and so they come on
time. <br />
3. Next to each major topic, include the type of action needed,
the type of output expected (decision, vote, action assigned to
someone), and time estimates for addressing each topic<br />
4. Ask participants if they'll commit to the agenda. <br />
5. Keep the agenda posted at all times.<br />
6. Don't overly design meetings; be willing to adapt the meeting
agenda if members are making progress in the planning process.<br />
7. Think about how you label an event, so people come in with
that mindset; it may pay to have a short dialogue around the label
to develop a common mindset among attendees, particularly if they
include representatives from various cultures.</p>

<h3>Opening Meetings</h3>

<p>1. Always start on time; this respects those who showed up
on time and reminds late-comers that the scheduling is serious.<br />
2. Welcome attendees and thank them for their time.<br />
3. Review the agenda at the beginning of each meeting, giving
participants a chance to understand all proposed major topics,
change them and accept them.<br />
4. Note that a meeting recorder if used will take minutes and
provide them back to each participant shortly after the meeting.<br />
5. Model the kind of energy and participant needed by meeting
participants.<br />
6. Clarify your role(s) in the meeting.</p>

<h3>Establishing Ground Rules for Meetings</h3>

<p>You don't need to develop new ground rules each time you have
a meeting, surely. However, it pays to have a few basic ground
rules that can be used for most of your meetings. These ground
rules cultivate the basic ingredients needed for a successful
meeting.<br />
1. Four powerful ground rules are: participate, get focus, maintain
momentum and reach closure. (You may want a ground rule about
confidentiality.)<br />
2. List your primary ground rules on the agenda.<br />
3. If you have new attendees who are not used to your meetings,
you might review <i>each</i> ground rule.<br />
4. Keep the ground rules posted at all times.</p>

<h3>Time Management</h3>

<p>1. One of the most difficult facilitation tasks is time management
-- time seems to run out before tasks are completed. Therefore,
the biggest challenge is keeping momentum to keep the process
moving.<br />
2. You might ask attendees to help you keep track of the time.<br />
3. If the planned time on the agenda is getting out of hand, present
it to the group and ask for their input as to a resolution.</p>

<h3>Evaluations of Meeting Process</h3>

<p>It's amazing how often people will complain about a meeting
being a complete waste of time -- but they only say so after the
meeting. Get their feedback during the meeting when you can improve
the meeting process right away. Evaluating a meeting only at the
end of the meeting is usually too late to do anything about participants'
feedback.<br />
1. Every couple of hours, conduct 5-10 minutes &quot;satisfaction
checks&quot;.<br />
2. In a round-table approach, quickly have each participant indicate
how they think the meeting is going.</p>

<h3>Evaluating the Overall Meeting</h3>

<p>1. Leave 5-10 minutes at the end of the meeting to evaluate
the meeting; don't skip this portion of the meeting.<br />
2. Have each member rank the meeting from 1-5, with 5 as the highest,
and have each member explain their ranking<br />
3. Have the chief executive rank the meeting last.</p>

<h3>Closing Meetings</h3>

<p>1. Always end meetings on time and attempt to end on a positive
note.<br />
2. At the end of a meeting, review actions and assignments, and
set the time for the next meeting and ask each person if they
can make it or not (to get their commitment)<br />
3. Clarify that meeting minutes and/or actions will be reported
back to members in at most a week (this helps to keep momentum
going).</p>

<h2>Managing Yourself</h2>

<p>There are many sources of additional information and advice
referenced at the end of this section.</p>

<h3>Role of New Manager or Supervisor of Often Very Stressful</h3>

<p>The experience of a first-time supervisor or manager is often
one of the most trying in their career. They rarely have adequate
training for the new management role -- they were promoted because
of their technical expertise, not because of their managerial
expertise. They suddenly have a wide range of policies and other
regulations to apply to their subordinates. Work is never &quot;done&quot;.
They must represent upper management to their subordinates, and
their subordinates to upper management. They're stuck in the middle.
They can feel very alone.</p>

<h3>Guidelines to Manage Yourself</h3>

<p>Everyone in management has gone through the transition from
individual contributor to manager. Each person finds their own
way to &quot;survive&quot;. The following guidelines will help
you keep your perspective and your health.</p>

<p>1. <b>Monitor your work hours</b><br />
The first visible, undeniable sign that things are out of hand
is that you're working too many hours. Note how many hours you
are working per week. Set a limit and stick to that limit. Ask
your peers or boss for help.</p>

<p>2. <b>Recognize your own signs of stress</b><br />
Different people show their stress in different ways. Some people
have &quot;blow ups&quot;. Some people get very forgetful. Some
people lose concentration. For many people, they excel at their
jobs, but their home life falls apart. Know your signs of stress.
Tell someone else what they are. Ask them to check in with you
every two weeks to see how you are doing. Every two weeks, write
down how you are doing -- if only for a minute. Stick in it a
file marked &quot;%*#)%&amp;!!#$&quot;.</p>

<p>3. <b>Get a mentor or a coach</b><br />
Ideally, your supervisors is a very good mentor and coach. Many
people have &quot;been there, done that&quot; and can serve as
great mentors to you.</p>

<p>4. <b>Learn to delegate</b><br />
Delegating is giving others the responsibility and authority to
carry out tasks. You maintain the accountability to get them done,
but you let others decide how they will carry out the tasks themselves.
Delegation is a skill to learn. Start learning it.&lt;</p>

<p>5. <b>Communicate as much as you can</b><br />
Have at least one person in your life with whom you are completely
honest. Hold regular meetings with staff -- all of them in one
meeting at least once a month, and meet at least once every two
weeks with each of your direct reports. A common problem among
new managers and supervisors (or among experienced, but ineffective
ones) is not meeting unless there's something to say. There is
always something to communicate, even if to say that things are
going well and then share the health of your pets. New managers
and supervisors often assume that their employees know as much
as they do. One of the first signs of an organization in trouble
is that communications break down. Err on the side of too much
communication, rather than not enough.</p>

<p>6. <b>Recognize what's important from what's urgent -- fix
the system, not the problem</b><br />
One of the major points that experienced manages make is that
they've learned to respond to what's important, rather than what's
urgent. Phone calls, sick employees, lost paperwork, disagreements
between employees all seem to suddenly crop up and demand immediate
attention. It can seem like your day is responding to one crises
after another. As you gain experience, you quit responding to
the crisis and instead respond to the problem that causes the
crises. You get an answering machine or someone else to answer
the phone. You plan for employees being gone for the day -- and
you accept that people get sick. You develop a filing system to
keep track of your paperwork. You learn basic skills in conflict
management. Most important, you recognize that management is a
process -- you never really &quot;finish&quot; your to-do list
-- your list is there to help you keep track of details. Over
time, you learn to relax.</p>

<p>7. <b>Recognize accomplishments</b><br />
Our society promotes problem solvers. We solve one problem and
quickly move on to the next. The culture of many organizations
rewards problem solvers. Once a problem is solved, we quickly
move on to the next to solve that one, too. Pretty soon we feel
empty. We feel as if we're not making a difference. Our subordinates
do, too. So in all your plans, include time to acknowledge accomplishments
-- if only by having a good laugh by the coffee machine, do take
time to note that something useful was done.</p>

<h2>Designing Organization and Staff</h2>

<p>Overall, the organization and its various groups should be
organized in the configuration that reaches business goals in
the most effective and efficient fashion. Guidelines in this section
will help you ensure your organization and its various groups
are organized in the best configuration possible.</p>

<p>NOTE: Sources for additional and advanced information are included
at the end of this section.</p>

<p><b>If You Are In An Already Established Organizations, Then
Organizing Will Be Easier if You Have Been ...</b><br />
1. Conducting strategic planning to regularly review the purpose
of your organization, its overall goals and who should be doing
what to meet those goals<br />
2. Using sound principles of employee performance management to
regularly review what employees should be doing to produce results,
how they're doing toward their results, and what must be done
to help them do a better job of achieving results</p>

<p><b>If You Are In An Already Established Organizations, Then
Typical Problems That Suggest Need for Organizing (or Re-Organizing)
Are ...</b><br />
There are several problems that seem to keep coming up in small
businesses, whether for-profit or nonprofit. These problems include:<br />
1. An employee keeps complaining (and you agree) that he or she
is overloaded with work. <br />
2. Employees complain that their activities overlap.<br />
3. An employee indicates (and you agree) that he or she does not
have enough work to do during a work day.<br />
4. Employees complain that they're reporting to more than one
boss, or supervisor. <br />
5. An employee complains that their work includes very different
tasks. For example, they may have a highly complex and demanding
project (e.g., leading strategic planning) and a large routine,
recurring task (sorting a great deal of the organization's daily
mail). <br />
6. Management notices a large amount of employee turnover, that
is, employees don't stay long enough with the organization.<br />
7. A department, or major function in the organization, has recurring
problems.</p>

<p>NOTE: It is not always problems that provoke the need for organizing.
For example, if the organization has been conducting strategic
planning and produced new goals, these goals may require the organization
to reorganize. For example, if the business wants to expand marketshare
in a certain region, then the organization may need a new office
in that region, more sales people, etc.</p>

<p><b>General Principles to Remember</b><br />
Whether you're in an already established or a new organization,
the activity of organizing and re-organizing can be a major undertaking
that has substantial effect on everyone in the organization. Therefore,
before we visit some specific guidelines for carrying out change,
it's important to keep the following general principles in mind:
<br />
1. Don't get wrapped up in doing change for the sake of change.
Know why you're making the change. Know what overall goal(s) do
you hope to accomplish.<br />
2. Successful change must involve the strong, ongoing, visible
participation of top management. <br />
3. Usually there's a champion who initially instigates the change
by being visionary, persuasive and consistent. <br />
4. A change agent role is usually responsible to translate the
vision to a realistic plan and carry out the plan. <br />
5. Take care of yourself first. Organization-wide change can be
highly stressful. <br />
6. The process won't be an &quot;aha!&quot; It will likely not
be as bad as you might expect, but won't be as good as you'd prefer
either. <br />
7. Keep perspective. Keep focused on meeting the needs of your
customers.<br />
8. Don't seek to control change, but rather to expect it, understand
it and manage it. <br />
9. Change is usually best carried out as a team-wide effort. <br />
10. Communications about the change should be frequent and with
all organization members. <br />
11. To sustain change, the structures of the organization itself
should be modified, including strategic plans, policies and procedures.</p>

<p><b>General Guidelines for Planning the Organizing</b><br />
Recurring problems often seem to have little to do with the business's
overall purpose and goals. However, any attempts at reorganizing
may be just fine tuning, or tweaking, if not done with the long
term in mind. In fact, the recurring problems may be a symptom
of the organization's not having clearly thought out what its
overall purpose and goals are. Without visiting the overall purpose
and goals, redesign is usually a highly reactive and very short-term
fix. Therefore:<br />
1. Carefully consider conducting a strategic planning process
to guide you through reviewing your organization's purpose. <br />
2. Consider using a consultant. Ensure the consultant is highly
experienced in organization-wide change. Ask to see references
and check the references. <br />
3. Plan the change. How do you plan to reach the goals, what will
you need to reach the goals, how long might it take and how will
you know when you've reached your goals or not? What will you
need in resources and how much will they probably cost? Focus
on the coordination of the departments/programs in your organization,
not on each part by itself. Have someone in charge of the plan.<br />
4. Document a plan. Forums should be held for organization members
to express their ideas for the plan. They should be able to express
their concerns and frustrations as well. Note that plans do change.
That's fine, but communicate that the plan has changed and why.
<br />
5. Include closure in the plan to acknowledge and celebrate your
accomplishments.<br />
6. Get as much feedback as practical from employees during planning
and implementation of the change, including what they think are
the problems and what should be done to resolve them. If possible,
work with a team of employees to manage the change.<br />
7. Widely communicate the plan, including the need for change.
The best approaches to address resistance to change is through
increased and sustained communications and education.</p>

<p><b>Guidelines During Organizational Design</b><br />
One of the most frequent and straightforward means to guide decisions
about organizational design is to examine similar businesses,
including similar design and nature of services and products.
However, management should still undertake careful examination
of the design of their business. The following guidelines will
help you in this activity.</p>

<p>Lewis, Lewis and Souflee, in <i>Management of Human Service
Organizations</i> (Books/Cole, 1991, p. 80) list several key questions
developing an organizational design. These questions apply, whether
for-profit or nonprofit organization. [Items in brackets &quot;[!!]&quot;
were inserted by Carter McNamara.!!]<br />
1. What are the primary goals and objectives that the organization
should be designed to meet? (Strategic planning will help you
determine what these goals are.)<br />
2. What continuing activities need to be performed in order to
implement the strategies that have been selected as part of the
planning process? (Strategic planning will help you determine
the answer to this question, too.)<br />
3. How can the necessary activities to be divided so that individuals
or groups can be assigned responsibility for performing them [that
is, organized into separate roles and jobs!!]? [Activities should
be grouped into related and similar activities as much as possible
so that individuals are working on tasks that are related and
similar.!!]<br />
4. Once activities have been grouped into specific jobs, what
kind of authority and responsibility should be assigned? <br />
5. How and by whom should decisions be made? [Attempt to always
and ultimately have one person who is singularly responsible for
decisions!!].<br />
6. How specialized should roles be?<br />
7. Who should control the work being performed? <br />
8. How can communication and coordination among members of the
organization be facilitated? <br />
9. How can job and role descriptions be developed to take into
account both functions and accountabilities?<br />
10. How can coordination and communication with the external social
environment be facilitated?</p>

<p>Also strive to have:<br />
11. Every employee ultimately reporting to one person, if possible,
and they should know who that person is. Job descriptions are
often complained about, but they are useful in specifying who
reports to whom.<br />
12. Carefully consider the span of control, that is, how many
people are reporting to whom. Can each manager really supervise
that many people in an effective fashion? <br />
13. When done designing the group, always build structure into
the new design through the use of organizational charts, job descriptions,
policies and procedures that document the design and who is doing
what in it.</p>

<h2>=== STAFFING ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor772661"></a></p>

<h2>Defining a New Job Role</h2>

<p>1. Recognizing the need for the new role <br />
Often, managers realize the need for a new organizational role
when employees continue to report being short-handed and mention
the same tasks are not being done. Ideally, planning for a new
role is done during strategic planning or when a new product or
service is added to the organization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For additional information, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/planning.htm"
  class="textlink">Workforce Planning</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/planning.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <b>Draft a job description</b><br />
Management should draft a job description which specifies the
general responsibilities of the position along with some of the
specific duties to be conducted by the role, the title for the
position, and any special skills, training or credentials required.
(Do not seek job descriptions from other organizations and merely
adopt those. Your open position is unique and job descriptions
are very important so you should develop your own -- the process
of completing the job description is usually enlightening.) Note
which job activities are essential and which are non-essential.
Add whom the position reports to and note if the position is full-time
or part-time. Consider if the position requires any special physical
skills (this may be important when considering accommodations
to candidates with physical disabilities and effects from the
Americans with Disabilities Act). If the position must be filled
by a paid employee (see the next paragraph to consider if a volunteer
or consultant is more appropriate), consider if the position is
exempt or non-exempt (exempt from being paid overtime). Usually,
highly skilled and/or professional roles are exempt, while entry-level
positions are non-exempt and will be paid for over-time. Invite
employees to review and edit the drafted job description. Consider
including a six-month probationary period for the new position
and if you do so, be sure to update your personnel policies to
describe your organization's use of the probationary conditions.
A probationary period allows you to fire an employee during the
six months if you have concerns and greatly decreases the chances
you will be sued for wrongful termination.</p>

  Descriptions</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>3. <b>Would a volunteer (in the case of nonprofits) or consultant
be appropriate?</b><br />
At this point, consider if the new position might be filled by
a volunteer or consultant. If the activities associated with the
role are highly critical for an extended duration, e.g., over
six months, and require both critical and general skills, you
may be better off to count on hiring an employee. On the other
hand, if the role's activities are entry-level and if you are
not sure that the position is really needed for the long term,
consider getting volunteers to fill the role. If the role requires
highly skilled personnel for a fixed duration, consider hiring
a consultant.</p>

  a Consultant</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm</li>
  <li><a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/volunteers.htm">Volunteer
  Programs</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/volunteers.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>4. <b>Determine the approximate cost of the new role</b><br />
Estimate the salary range for the new position. Set this range
by talking to other organizations with similar product or services,
or by scanning classified sections of newspapers with ads for
similar roles. Finalize how much the position will cost the organization
by adding &quot;fringe&quot; to the salary. For planning purposes,
fringe might be estimated at 40% of the salary. Fringe includes
costs of benefits planned for the new role, including health and
dental and life insurance, and retirement benefits, along with
required unemployment taxes, worker's compensation and any pension
plans. Note that, depending on the state in which you live, you
may be required to required to pay certain employment taxes for
part-time people, often if they are at or over half-time. Additional
costs of the position result from training, equipment, rental
of space, postage, copying, etc. (You should develop a compensation
program, with policies that outline the procedure for determination
of salary and benefits.</p>

<p>For additional and advanced information, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://managementhelp.org/payandbenefits/index.htm">Benefits
  and Compensation</a> at http://managementhelp.org/payandbenefits/index.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>5. <b>Get feedback and authorization from the board (in the
case of corporations)</b><br />
You may want to work with the board chair to prepare for communication
of the new job to the board. Propose the new position to the board
by attaching a proposal letter to the drafted job description
along with description of how the position will be funded and
sending it to all board members for their review before the next
board meeting. At the board meeting, invite open discussion and
questions about the new role. Seek their authorization for the
new position.</p>

<p>6. <b>Finalize the job description</b><br />
Update the job description with relevant feedback from the boar
(in the case of corporations). It's important that the job description
be as accurate as possible because it is the basis for determining
initial compensation, conveying the role to the new employee and
conducting regular performance appraisals. Be sure to note the
version of the job description by including the date on the bottom.
The job description should be reviewed and updated annually, usually
by the employee and supervisor during the performance review cycle
(described later on in this section).</p>

<p>1. <b>Advertise the position</b><br />
Post ads in classified sections of local major and neighborhood
newspapers. In the ads, include the job title, general responsibilities,
minimum skills and/or education required, whom they should send
a resume to if they are interested and by when. Consider having
a closing date after which you won't accept resumes. Mention the
role to customers. Send cover letters and job descriptions to
professional organizations. Be sure to mention the role to all
employees to see if they have any favorite candidates.</p>

<p>For additional and advanced information, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/recruiting.htm">Advertising
  for Employees</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/recruiting</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <b>Current employees should be able to apply for the job.</b>
<br />
Considerations in hiring them for the new role will have to include
the impact on the organization if the employee leaves behind a
critical and unfilled role in the organization. Some organizations
may elect to give internal candidates the first shot at the job.</p>

<p>3. <b>Screen resumes</b><br />
When screening resumes, note the candidate's career objective
-- or the lack of it. If not specified, the candidate may not
have considered what they want to do in the future, which may
impact their commitment to your new role. Note if they stayed
at jobs long or left quickly. Are there holes in their work history?
Note their education and training. Is it appropriate for the new
role? Consider what capabilities and skills might be evidenced
in their past and current work activities. If you have lots of
resumes, it helps greatly to enter in a word processor, the &quot;highlights&quot;
and &quot;concerns&quot; information about each candidate; otherwise,
after about 10 resumes, they all look the same. Having information
online helps you keep perspective and you can go back later and
have a strong overview of the candidates. Consider routing resumes
past key employees to collect their rankings. Interview all candidates
that meet the minimum qualifications. (At this point, be sure
that you're not excluding candidates because of unfair biases.)</p>

<p>For additional and advanced information, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/screening.htm">Screening
  Applicants</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/screening.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>4. <b>Interview candidates</b><br />
Send the job description to candidates before they come to the
interview meeting. While interviewing candidates, always apply
the same questions to all candidates to ensure fairness. All questions
should be in regard to performing the duties of the job. Ask about
their compensation needs and expected or needed benefits. Attempt
to ask open-ended questions, i.e., avoid &quot;yes-no&quot; questions.
Talk for at most 25% of the time -- for the rest, listen. Don't
rely on your memory -- ask permission from the interviewee to
take notes. Find out when they can start if offered the job. Consider
having multiple people at the interview; although this can be
intimidating to the interviewee, this practice can ensure them
a much more objective and fair presentation. Have the same interviewers
in all of the interviews if possible. Consider asking some challenging,
open-ended questions, such as &quot;What skills do you bring to
this job?&quot;, &quot;What concerns do you have about filling
this role?&quot;, &quot;What was your biggest challenge in a past
job and how did you meet it?&quot; Don't ask questions about race,
nationality, age, gender, disabilities (current or previous),
marital status, spouses, children and their care, criminal records
or credit records. Have all interviewers share/record their impressions
of the candidate soon after the interview meeting. Explain to
the candidate that you'll be getting back to them soon, and always
do this. Ask if you can get and check any references. Always check
references and share them with the interviewers. Be sure to tell
candidates of any relevant personnel policies terms, such as probationary
periods. (The best way to deal with a poor performer is not to
hire him or her in the first place. It is often wise to have a
probationary period of, e.g., six months, wherein if the employee
does not meet the responsibilities of the position, you can terminate
the employee.) If practical, look into the applicant's background
to ascertain if they have a criminal record.</p>

  Checks</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/screening.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>5. <b>Select the candidate</b><br />
Usually, this is not as easy as one would like because two or
three candidates come in close. Have a highly focused meeting
with all interviewers. Have each suggest their favorite candidate.
If there is disagreement, focus discussion to identify the one
or two areas in which interviewers disagree about the candidates.
Then have each interviewer explain their impressions. At this
point, interviewers usually come to consensus and agree on one
candidate.</p>

  (Hiring) New Employees</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/hiring.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>6. <b>If there does not seem to be suitable candidate</b><br />
Consider if the job requirements are too stringent or are an odd
mix. For example, you might not find someone who's highly interested
in a certain technical skill or service and who also shows strong
interest in general skills. Reconfigure the job so that required
skills and training are somewhat similar and the role becomes
more standard. Or, consider hiring the candidate who came in closest
and plan for dedicated training to bring their skills to the needed
levels. Or, re-advertise the position. Consider getting advice
from a human resources professional (at this point, your need
for them is quite specific, so they might provide services on
a pro bono basis). Or, consider hiring a consultant on a short-term
basis, but only as a last resort as this may be quite expensive.</p>

  a Consultant</a> at http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>7. <b>If everyone turns down the job</b><br />
The best strategy is to ask the candidates why they turned the
job down. Usually, you'll hear the same concerns, e.g., the pay
is too low or the benefits incomplete, the organization seems
confused about what it wants from the role, the interview process
seemed hostile or contentious, etc. Reconvene the interviewers
and consider what you heard from the candidates. Recognize what
went wrong and correct the problem. Call back your favorite candidates,
admit the mistake and what you did, and why you'd like to make
an offer to them again.</p>

<p>8. <b>Offer letter</b><br />
If they accept an offer, always follow-up with an offer letter,
specifying the compensation, benefits, and starting date and reference
an attached job description. Ask them to sign a copy of the offer
letter and return it to you.</p>

<h2>Building Teams</h2>


<p>Management experts assert that most work (and most learning)
occurs in teams. Therefore, it's important to know how to design,
build and support highly effective teams.</p>

<p>NOTE: There are several major &quot;breakthroughs&quot; in
how teams are designed and carried out. These activities can be
done. These breakthroughs are in regard to the extent of independence
of the teams, producing, for example, self-organized teams, self-directed
teams and self-managed teams.</p>

<p>NOTE: Additional and advanced information is referenced at
the end of this section.</p>

<h3>Major Types of Teams (or Groups)</h3>

<p>There are many types of teams. The type used depends very much
on the nature of the results the team is to accomplish.</p>

<h3>Formal and informal teams</h3>

<p>are &quot;official&quot; parts of the overall organization,
assigned to a major, ongoing function, for example, quality management,
patient care, etc. Management appoints formal teams. Informal
teams are usually loosely organized groups of people who volunteer
to come together to address a non-critical, short-term purpose.</p>

<h4>Committees</h4>

<p>are organized to address, major ongoing tasks in an organization
and membership is based on position, for example, committees in
boards of directors, grievance committees, etc.</p>

<h4>Problem solving teams</h4>

<p>These teams are formed to address a particular, major problem
currently faced by the organization. Often, their overall goal
is to provide a written report that includes recommendations for
solving the problem. Membership is comprised of people who perceive
and experience the problem, as well as those who can do something
about it.</p>

<h4>Self-directed and self-managed teams</h4>

<p>These increasingly used types of teams afford members great
latitude in how they achieve the overall results preferred from
the team. For example, they may select their leader who serves
for a limited time and purpose, depending on the particular point
in the group's process. This type of team is used especially when
the team is working in a complex, rapidly changing environment.</p>

<h3>Stages of Team Development</h3>

<p>It helps a great deal to have some basic sense for the life
of a team. Teams go through several major phases including the
following:</p>

<h4>Forming:</h4>

<p>Members first get together. Individually, they consider &quot;What
am I here for?&quot;, &quot;Who else is here&quot;, &quot;Who
am I comfortable with?&quot;, etc. During this stage, it's important
to get members involved, including to introduce themselves to
each other. The team may require clear leadership to facilitate
clarity and comfort for involvement of members.</p>

<h4>Storming:</h4>

<p>During this stage, members are beginning to voice their individual
differences, trying for join with others who share the same beliefs,
trying to jockey for position in the group. Therefore, it's important
for members to continue to be highly involved, including voicing
their concerns in order to feel represented and understood. The
team leader should focus on clarity of views, achieving consensus
(or commonality of views) and recording decisions.</p>

<h4>Norming:</h4>

<p>In this stage, members begin to share common commitment to
the purpose of the group, including its overall goals and how
it will reach those goals. The team leader should focus on achieving
clarity of roles, structure and process of the group.</p>

<h4>Performing:</h4>

<p>In this stage, the team is &quot;humming&quot;. Members are
actively participating in the team process in order to achieve
the goals of the group and its organization. During this stage,
the style of leadership becomes more indirect as members take
on stronger participation and involvement in the group process.</p>

<h4>Closing and Celebration:</h4>

<p>At this stage, it's clear to members and their organization
that the team has achieved its overall purpose (or a major milestone
along the way). It's critical to acknowledge this point in the
life of the team, lest members feel unfulfilled and skeptical
about future team efforts.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for Designing Teams</h3>

<p>1. <b>Set clear goals for the results to be produced by the
team</b><br />
The goals should be designed to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;, that is,
be specific, measurable, acceptable to members, realistic, and
have a time frame to be started and stopped, extend the capabilities
of members and provide reward for their accomplishment. As much
as possible, include input from other members of the organization
when designing and wording these goals. Goals might be, for example,
&quot;produce a project report that specifies project plan, schedule
and budget to develop and test a complete employee performance
management system within the next year&quot;. Write these goals
down for eventual communication to and discussion with all team
members.</p>

<p>2. <b>Set clear goals for the effectiveness of the team process</b><br />
The goals should also be designed to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;. Goals
might be, for example, attain 90% participation of all members
during the first 6 weeks of weekly attendance, achieve 90% satisfaction
ratings among members, each person takes at least one turn at
facilitating the group, meetings start and stop on time, etc.
Write these goals down for eventual communication to all team
members. Write these goals down for eventual communication to
and discussion with all team members.</p>

<p>3. <b>Determine time frames for commencing and terminating
the team, if applicable</b><br />
Write these times down for eventual communication to and discussion
with all team members.</p>

<p>4. <b>Determine the type of team</b><br />
Various types of teams have various purposes. Consider use of
permanent teams, committees, self-directed teams, problem solving
teams, etc. (See additional information provided at the end of
this section.)</p>

<p>5. <b>Determine the membership of the group</b><br />
Consider the extent of expertise needed to achieve the goals,
including areas of knowledge and skills. Include at least one
person who has skills in facilitation and meeting management.
Attempt to include sufficient diversity of values and perspectives
to ensure robust ideas and discussion. A critical consideration
is availability -- members should have the time to attend every
meeting.</p>

<p>6. <b>Determine the structure of the group</b><br />
Structure includes the number of people in the group, how often
they will meet and when and who will be the leader of the group.</p>

<p>7. <b>Determine the process of the group</b><br />
Depending on the nature of the results to be produced by the group,
the process might be focused on open discussion, action planning,
problem solving and decision making, generating recommendations,
etc.</p>

<p>8. <b>Identify any needs for training and materials</b><br />
For example, members might benefit from brief overview of the
stages of development of a team, receive training and packets
of materials in regard to their goals and the structure and process
of their team, etc.</p>

<p>9. <b>Identify the costs to provide necessary resources for
the team</b><br />
Consider the cost of paying employees to attend the meeting, trainers
and/or consultants, room rental, office supplies, etc.</p>

<p>10. <b>Plan the first meeting</b><br />
In the first meeting, communicate the goals of the team, why each
member was selected, the overall benefit of the goals to the organization,
the time frame for the team effort, who will lead the team (at
least, initially), when the team might meet and where, etc. Have
this information written down to hand out to each member.</p>

<p>11. <b>Early on, plan team building activities to support trust
and strong working relationships among members</b><br />
Team building activities can include, for example, a retreat in
which members introduce themselves, exercises in which members
help each other solve a short problem or meet a specific and achievable
goal, extended period in which members can voice their concerns
and frustrations about their team assignments, etc.</p>

<p>12. <b>Support team meetings and processes</b><br />
At this point, it's critical that supervisors remain available
to provide support and resources as needed. Monitor that team
goals are being met. Provide ongoing encouragement and visibility
to members. One of the most important forms of support a supervisor
can provide is coordination with other supervisors to ensure that
team members are freed up enough to attend team meetings.</p>

<h2>=== TRAINING ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor775597"></a></p>

<h2>Orienting New Employees</h2>

<p>Develop an employee orientation checklist and consider the
following activities for inclusion on the list. The following
activities should be conducted by the employee's supervisor.</p>

<p>1. <b>Before the employee begins employment, send them a letter
welcoming them</b><br />
to the organization, verifying their starting date and providing
them a copy of the employee policies and procedures manual. Note
that you'll dedicate time for them to discuss with manual with
you later.</p>

<p>2. <b>When the employee begins employment, meet with them</b>
<br />
to explain how they will be trained, introduce them to staff,
give them keys, get them to sign any needed benefit and tax forms,
explain the time-recording system (if applicable), and provide
them copies of important documents (an organization chart, last
year's final report, the strategic plan, this year's budget, and
the employee's policies and procedure manual if they did not get
one already).</p>

<p>3. <b>Show them the facilities</b>, <br />
including layout of offices, bathrooms, storage areas, kitchen
use, copy and fax systems, computer configuration and procedures,
telephone usage, and any special billing procedures for use of
office systems.</p>

<p>4. <b>Schedule any needed computer training</b>, <br />
including use of passwords, overview of software and documentation,
location and use of peripherals, and where to go to get questions
answered.</p>

<p>5. <b>Review any policies and/or procedures about use of facilities</b>.</p>

<p>6. <b>Assign an employee to them as their &quot;buddy&quot;</b><br />
who remains available to answer any questions.</p>

<p>7. <b>Take them to lunch on the first day</b><br />
and invite other employees along.</p>

<p>8. <b>Meet with them at the end of the day</b><br />
to hear any questions or comments.</p>

<p>9. <b>Meet with the new employee during the first few days</b>
<br />
of employment to review the job description again. Remind them
to review the employee manual and sign a form indicating they
have reviewed the manual and will comply with its contents. Review
any specific goals for the position, e.g., goals from the strategic
plan. In the same meeting, explain the performance review procedure
and provide them a copy of the performance review document.</p>

<p>10. <b>Have one-on-one meetings with the new employee on a
weekly basis for the first six weeks</b>,<br />
to discuss the new employee's transition into the organization,
get status on work activities, hear any pending issues or needs,
and establish a working relationship with their supervisor.</p>

<h2>Job Training</h2>

<h3>Some Basics to Know About Training</h3>

<h4>Variety of Reasons for Training</h4>

<p>Employee job training can be initiated for a variety of reasons
for an employee or group of employees, e.g.,:<br />
a.) When a performance appraisal indicates performance improvement
is needed<br />
b.) To &quot;benchmark&quot; the status of improvement so far
in a performance improvement effort<br />
c.) As part of an overall professional development program<br />
d.) As part of succession planning to help an employee be eligible
for a planned change in role in the organization<br />
e.) To &quot;pilot&quot;, or test, the operation of a new performance
management system<br />
f.) To train about a specific topic</p>

<h3>Very Basic Types of Training</h3>

<p>When planning training for your employees, it helps to understand
some basics about training. Let's look at four types of training.</p>

<h4>Self-Directed Learning</h4>

<p>Self-directed learning is where the learner decides what he
or she will learn and how.</p>

<h4>Other-Directed Learning</h4>

<p>Other-directed learning is where other people decide what the
learner will learn and how.</p>

<h4>Informal training</h4>

<p>Informal training has no predetermined form. Examples are reading
books to learn about a subject, talking to friends about the subject,
attending a presentation, etc.</p>

<h4>Formal Training</h4>

<p>Formal training has a predetermined form. The form usually
includes specification of learning results, learning objectives
and activities that will achieve the results, and how the training
will be evaluated. Examples might be college courses, workshops,
seminars, etc. Note that because formal training has a form, it
does not necessarily mean that formal training is better than
other forms.</p>

<h4>Informal Means of Training</h4>

<p>This is probably the most common type of training and includes,
for example, on-the-job training, coaching from supervisors, using
manuals and procedures, advice from peers, etc.</p>

<h4>Coaching</h4>

<p>Probably the most common form of informal training is job coaching.
<br />
1. The supervisor, or some other expert at the subject matter
or skill, tells the employee how to do something.<br />
2. The employee tries it.<br />
3. The expert watches and gives feedback.<br />
4. The employee tries it until he or she gets it right.</p>

<p>The above approach works best in tasks or jobs that include
straightforward procedures or routines. As jobs and roles become
more complex, employees often require more formal training.</p>

<h3>Common Pitfalls in Employee Training</h3>

<p>1. New managers and supervisors often underestimate the value
of training. <br />
2. Or, they perceive it as occurring only in classrooms. <br />
3. Or, they assume that because an employee has attended a course,
workshop or seminar, than he or she must have learned what they
needed to know. <br />
4. Or, they believe that good training can only occur from highly
trained professionals.</p>

<h3>Learn How to Plan Your Training</h3>

<p>Supervisors and employees can accomplish highly effective training
by following certain guidelines.</p>

<p>The following guidelines (along with additional advice and
resources to fill out your training plan) are included in the
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm"
class="textlink">Complete Guidelines to Design Your Training Plan</a>
at http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm</p>

<h4>Determining Your Overall Goals in Training</h4>

<p>1. Are there any time lines that you should consider in your
plan? <br />
2. Are you pursuing training and development in order to address
a performance gap? <br />
3. Or, is your plan to address a growth gap? <br />
4. Or, is your plan to address an opportunity gap?<br />
5. Get feedback from others<br />
6. Should you conduct a self-assessment? <br />
7. Is a list of competencies, job descriptions or job analysis
available to help you identify your training and development goals?
<br />
8. Begin thinking about how much money you will need to fund your
plan. <br />
9. Write down your training goals.</p>

<h4>Identifying Your Learning Objectives and Activities</h4>

<p>1. What new areas of knowledge or skills are needed to reach
the training goals. Each of these new areas is a learning objectives.
Write down the learning objectives. <br />
2. In what sequence should the learning objectives be attained?
<br />
a. Carefully consider -- When you have achieved all of your learning
objectives, will you indeed have achieved all of your overall
training goals? <br />
b. What are the best learning activities (methods) for you to
achieve your learning objectives? Do your learning activities
include your ongoing reflections about your learning? <br />
c. What observable results, or evidence of learning, will you
produce from your learning activities that can be reviewed for
verification of learning? <br />
d. Who will verify that each of your learning objectives were
reached? <br />
3. Now that you know what activities that will be conducted, think
again about any costs that will be needed, e.g., for materials,
facilities, etc. <br />
4. How will you handle any ongoing time and stress management
issues while implementing your plan?</p>

<h4>Developing Any Materials You May Need</h4>

<p>1. Consider if you need to obtain, or start:<br />
a. Enrolling in courses<br />
b. Buying books<br />
c. Scheduling time with experts<br />
d. Getting a mentor<br />
e. Scheduling time with your supervisor, etc.</p>

<h4>Planning Implementation of Your Training Plan</h4>

<p>1. During your training, how will you be sure that you understand
the new information and materials? <br />
2. Will your learning be engaging and enjoyable? <br />
3. Are you sure that you'll receive the necessary ongoing feedback,
coaching, mentoring, etc., during your training and development
activities? <br />
4. Where will you get necessary administrative support and materials?</p>

<h4>Planning Evaluation of Your Training Plan and Experiences</h4>

<p>1. Who's in charge of implementing and tracking your overall
plan? <br />
2. Consider having a local training expert review the plan. <br />
3. Are approaches to evaluation included in all phases of your
plan? <br />
For example, are your methods being pretested before being applied?
Do you understand the methods as they're being applied? Are regularly
providing feedback about how well you understand the materials?
How will the you (and your supervisor, if applicable) know if
implementation of the plan achieves the training goals identified
in the plan? Are there any plans for follow-up evaluation, including
assessing your results several months after you completed your
plan?</p>

<h4>Budget Necessary Resources for Training</h4>

<p>1. Consider costs of trainers, consultants, room rental, books,
tuition, labor to pay the employee while attending training, etc.</p>

<h2>=== EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor240528"></a></p>

<h2>Setting Goals</h2>

<h3>New Managers and Supervisors Often Lack Perspective on Performance
of Employees</h3>

<p>One of the common problems that new managers and supervisors
experience is no clear, strong sense whether their employees are
really being effective or not. The first step toward solving this
problem is to establish clear performance goals.</p>

<p>Some people have a strong negative reaction toward setting
goals because they fear goals as &quot;the law&quot; that must
be maintained and never broken. Some people fear they will not
achieve the goals. Others have disdain for goals because goals
seem to take the &quot;heart&quot; out their work.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Goals</h3>

<p>Despite the negative views that one can have about goals, they
hold certain strong advantages in the workplace. They:<br />
1. Provide clear direction to both supervisor and employee<br />
2. Form a common frame of reference around which the supervisor
and employee can effectively communicate<br />
3. Clearly indicate success, and can facilitate strong sense of
fulfillment for employee and supervisor<br />
4. Help clarify the roles of the supervisor and employee.</p>

<h3>Goals for Performance Gaps, Growth Gaps, Opportunity Gaps
and Training Gaps</h3>

<p>Goals can be established for a variety of reasons, for example,
to overcome performance problems, qualify for future jobs and
roles, take advantage of sudden opportunities that arise and/or
give direction to training plans.</p>

<p>Performance gaps are identified during the employee performance
management process. Ideally, performance gaps are addressed by
performance improvement plans. In these plans, goals are established
to improve performance, and may include, for example, increased
effort on the part of the employee, support from the supervisor,
and certain training and resources to assist the employee in their
development. Dedicated employees can greatly appreciate having
specific performance goals for them to achieve in order to keep
their jobs, verify their competence to their supervisor and accomplish
overall professional development.</p>

<p>Growth gaps are identified during career planning. Employees
perceive certain areas of knowledge and skills that they would
like to accomplish in order to qualify for certain future roles
and positions. Employees often appreciate having clear-cut goals
that mark what they need to do to advance in their careers.</p>

<p>Opportunity gaps are identified when a sudden opportunity arises
for the employee. If the employee is highly interested in taking
advantage of the opportunity, then he or she will appreciate knowing
exactly what they need to accomplish (what goals they need to
achieve) to grab the opportunity.</p>

<p>Training gaps are identified when hiring a new employee, during
employee performance management or career planning. Gaps are usually
in terms of areas of knowledge, skills or abilities. Training
plans can be designed with clear-cut training goals to give direction
to the employee and trainer.</p>

<p>Whatever the type of goal, it's critical that the employee
have strong ownership and commitment to achieving the goal.</p>

<h3>Goals Can Be Agreeable to Supervisors and Employees</h3>

<p>These views can be addressed, largely by <br />
a) ensuring that employees are strongly involved in identifying
them, <br />
b) goals are conveyed as guidelines and that they can be missed
as long as there is clear explanation for missing the goals before
they are missed, and<br />
c) the goals are &quot;SMARTER&quot; (more on this below).</p>

<p>When setting goals with employees, strive to design and describe
them to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;. This acronym is described in this
guide, in a subsection listed above, and stands for:<br />
1. Specific<br />
2. Measurable<br />
3. Acceptable<br />
4. Realistic<br />
5. Timely<br />
6. Extending capabilities<br />
7. Rewarding</p>

<p>If goals seem insurmountable to the employee, then break goals
down into smaller goals, or sub-goals or objectives. Each of these
should be SMARTER, as well.</p>

<p>(For further explanation, see the above subsection &quot; <a
href="#anchor155743" class="textlink">Goals and Objectives Should
Be SMARTER</a>&quot; included in the above topic &quot;Planning&quot;.)</p>

<h2>Supporting Employee Motivation</h2>

<h3>Clearing Up Common Myths About Employee Motivation</h3>
<p>
The topic of motivating employees is extremely important to managers
and supervisors. Despite the important of the topic, several myths
persist -- especially among new managers and supervisors. Before
looking at what management can do to support the motivation of
employees, it's important first to clear up these common myths.</p>

<p>1. <b>Myth #1 -- &quot;I can motivate people&quot;</b><br />
Not really -- they have to motivate themselves. You can't motivate
people anymore than you can empower them. Employees have to motivate
and empower themselves. However, you can set up an environment
where they best motivate and empower themselves. The key is knowing
how to set up the environment for each of your employees.</p>

<p>2. <b>Myth #2 -- &quot;Money is a good motivator&quot;</b><br />
Not really. Certain things like money, a nice office and job security
can help people from becoming less motivated, but they usually
don't help people to become more motivated. A key goal is to understand
the motivations of each of your employees.</p>

<p>3. <b>Myth #3 -- &quot;Fear is a damn good motivator&quot;</b><br />
Fear is a great motivator -- for a very short time. That's why
a lot of yelling from the boss won't seem to &quot;light a spark
under employees&quot; for a very long time.</p>

<p>4. <b>Myth #4 -- &quot;I know what motivates me, so I know
what motivates my employees&quot;</b><br />
Not really. Different people are motivated by different things.
I may be greatly motivated by earning time away from my job to
spend more time my family. You might be motivated much more by
recognition of a job well done. People are motivated by the same
things. Again, a key goal is to understand what motivates each
of your employees.</p>

<p>5. <b>Myth #5 -- &quot;Increased job satisfaction means increased
job performance&quot;</b><br />
Research shows this isn't necessarily true at all. Increased job
satisfaction does not necessarily mean increased job performance.
If the goals of the organization are not aligned with the goals
of employees, then employees aren't effectively working toward
the mission of the organization.</p>

<p>6. <b>Myth #6 -- &quot;I can't comprehend employee motivation
-- it's a science&quot;</b><br />
Nah. Not true. There are some very basic steps you can take that
will go a long way toward supporting your employees to motivate
themselves toward increased performance in their jobs. (More about
these steps is provided later on in this article.)</p>

<h3>Basic Principles to Remember</h3>

<p>1. <b>Motivating employees starts with motivating yourself</b><br />
It's amazing how, if you hate your job, it seems like everyone
else does, too. If you are very stressed out, it seems like everyone
else is, too. Enthusiasm is contagious. If you're enthusiastic
about your job, it's much easier for others to be, too. Also,
if you're doing a good job of taking care of yourself and your
own job, you'll have much clearer perspective on how others are
doing in theirs.</p>

<p>A great place to start learning about motivation is to start
understanding your own motivations. The key to helping to motivate
your employees is to understand what motivates them. So what motivates
you? Consider, for example, time with family, recognition, a job
well done, service, learning, etc. How is your job configured
to support your own motivations? What can you do to better motivate
yourself?</p>

<p>2. <b>Always work to align goals of the organization with goals
of employees</b><br />
As mentioned above, employees can be all fired up about their
work and be working very hard. However, if the results of their
work don't contribute to the goals of the organization, then the
organization is not any better off than if the employees were
sitting on their hands -- maybe worse off! Therefore, it's critical
that managers and supervisors know what they want from their employees.
These preferences should be worded in terms of goals for the organization.
Identifying the goals for the organization is usually done during
strategic planning. Whatever steps you take to support the motivation
of your employees (various steps are suggested below), ensure
that employees have strong input to identifying their goals and
that these goals are aligned with goals of the organization. (Goals
should be worded to be &quot;SMARTER&quot;. More about this later
on below.)</p>

<p>3. <b>Key to supporting the motivation of your employees is
understanding what motivates each of them</b><br />
Each person is motivated by different things. Whatever steps you
take to support the motivation of your employees, they should
first include finding out what it is that really motivates each
of your employees. You can find this out by asking them, listening
to them and observing them. (More about this later on below.)</p>

<p>4. <b>Recognize that supporting employee motivation is a process,
not a task</b><br />
Organizations change all the time, as do people. Indeed, it is
an ongoing process to sustain an environment where each employee
can strongly motivate themselves. If you look at sustaining employee
motivation as an ongoing process, then you'll be much more fulfilled
and motivated yourself.</p>

<p>5. <b>Support employee motivation by using organizational systems
(for example, policies and procedures) -- don't just count on
good intentions</b><br />
Don't just count on cultivating strong interpersonal relationships
with employees to help motivate them. The nature of these relationships
can change greatly, for example, during times of stress. Instead,
use reliable and comprehensive systems in the workplace to help
motivate employees. For example, establish compensation systems,
employee performance systems, organizational policies and procedures,
etc., to support employee motivation. Also, establishing various
systems and structures helps ensure clear understanding and equitable
treatment of employees.</p>

<h3>Steps You Can Take</h3>

<p>The following specific steps can help you go a long way toward
supporting your employees to motivate themselves in your organization.</p>

<p>1. <b>Do more than read this article -- apply what you're reading
here</b><br />
This maxim is true when reading any management publication.</p>

<p>2. <b>Briefly write down the motivational factors that sustain
you and what you can do to sustain them</b><br />
This little bit of &quot;motivation planning&quot; can give you
strong perspective on how to think about supporting the motivations
of your employees.</p>

<p>3. <b>Make of list of three to five things that motivate each
of your employees</b><br />
Read the article <a href="http://www.lawsoncg.com/lcgi-article_motivate.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How to Motivate Today's Worker</a>.
Notice the list of motivating factors in the section &quot;Assessing
Your Approach.&quot; Fill out the list yourself for each of your
employees and then have each of your employees fill out the list
for themselves. Compare your answers to theirs. Recognize the
differences between your impression of what you think is important
to them and what they think is important to them. Then meet with
each of your employees to discuss what they think are the most
important motivational factors to them. Lastly, take some time
alone to write down how you will modify your approaches with each
employee to ensure their motivational factors are being met. (NOTE:
This may seem like a &quot;soft, touchy-feely exercise&quot; to
you. If it does, then talk to a peer or your boss about it. Much
of what's important in management is based very much on &quot;soft,
touchy-feely exercises&quot;. Learn to become more comfortable
with them. The place to start is to recognize their importance.)</p>

<p>4. <b>Work with each employee to ensure their motivational
factors are taken into consideration in your reward systems</b><br />
For example, their jobs might be redesigned to be more fulfilling.
You might find more means to provide recognition, if that is important
to them. You might develop a personnel policy that rewards employees
with more family time, etc.</p>

<p>5. <b>Have one-on-one meetings with each employee</b><br />
Employees are motivated more by your care and concern for them
than by your attention to them. Get to know your employees, their
families, their favorite foods, names of their children, etc.
This can sound manipulative -- and it will be if not done sincerely.
However, even if you sincerely want to get to know each of your
employees, it may not happen unless you intentionally set aside
time to be with each of them.</p>

<p>6. <b>Cultivate strong skills in delegation</b><br />
Delegation includes conveying responsibility and authority to
your employees so they can carry out certain tasks. However, you
leave it up to your employees to decide <i>how</i> they will carry
out the tasks. Skills in delegation can free up a great deal of
time for managers and supervisors. It also allows employees to
take a stronger role in their jobs, which usually means more fulfillment
and motivation in their jobs, as well.</p>

<p>7. <b>Reward it when you <i>see</i> it</b><br />
A critical lesson for new managers and supervisors is to learn
to focus on employee behaviors, not on employee personalities.
Performance in the workplace should be based on behaviors toward
goals, not on popularity of employees. You can get in a great
deal of trouble (legally, morally and interpersonally) for focusing
only on how you <i>feel</i> about your employees rather than on
what you're <i>seeing</i> with your eyeballs.</p>

<p>8. <b>Reward it soon after you see it</b><br />
This helps to reinforce the notion that you highly prefer the
behaviors that you're currently seeing from your employees. Often,
the shorter the time between an employee's action and your reward
for the action, the clearer it is to the employee that you highly
prefer that action.</p>

<p>9. <b>Implement at least the basic principles of performance
management</b><br />
Good performance management includes identifying goals, measures
to indicate if the goals are being met or not, ongoing attention
and feedback about measures toward the goals, and corrective actions
to redirect activities back toward achieving the goals when necessary.
Performance management can focus on organizations, groups, processes
in the organization and employees.</p>

<p>10. <b>Establish goals that are SMARTER</b><br />
SMARTER goals are: specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic,
timely, extending of capabilities, and rewarding to those involved.</p>

<p>11. <b>Clearly convey how employee results contribute to organizational
results</b><br />
Employees often feel strong fulfillment from realizing that they're
actually making a difference. This realization often requires
clear communication about organizational goals, employee progress
toward those goals and celebration when the goals are met.</p>

<p>12. <b>Celebrate achievements</b><br />
This critical step is often forgotten. New managers and supervisors
are often focused on a getting &quot;a lot done&quot;. This usually
means identifying and solving problems. Experienced managers come
to understand that acknowledging and celebrating a solution to
a problem can be every bit as important as the solution itself.
Without ongoing acknowledgement of success, employees become frustrated,
skeptical and even cynical about efforts in the organization.</p>

<p>13. <b>Let employees hear from their customers (internal or
external)</b><br />
Let employees hear customers proclaim the benefits of the efforts
of the employee . For example, if the employee is working to keep
internal computer systems running for other employees (internal
customers) in the organization, then have other employees express
their gratitude to the employee. If an employee is providing a
product or service to external customers, then bring in a customer
to express their appreciation to the employee.</p>

<p>14. <b>Admit to yourself (and to an appropriate someone else)
if you don't like an employee --</b><br />
Managers and supervisors are people. It's not unusual to just
not like someone who works for you. That someone could, for example,
look like an uncle you don't like. In this case, admit to yourself
that you don't like the employee. Then talk to someone else who
is appropriate to hear about your distaste for the employee, for
example, a peer, your boss, your spouse, etc. Indicate to the
appropriate person that you want to explore what it is that you
don't like about the employee and would like to come to a clearer
perception of how you can accomplish a positive working relationship
with the employee. It often helps a great deal just to talk out
loud about how you feel and get someone else's opinion about the
situation. As noted above, if you continue to focus on what you
<i>see</i> about employee performance, you'll go a long way toward
ensuring that your treatment of employees remains fair and equitable.</p>

<h2>Observing and Giving Feedback</h2>

<p>McGill and Beatty (in &quot;Action learning: A practitioner&#146;s
guide&quot;, London: Kogan Page, 1994, p. 159-163) provide useful
suggestions about sharing effective feedback:</p>

<p>1. Clarity -- Be clear about what you want to say.</p>

<p>2. Emphasize the positive -- This isn&#146;t being collusive
in the person's dilemma.</p>

<p>3. Be specific -- Avoid general comments and clarify pronouns
such as &#147;it,&#148; &#147;that,&#148; etc.</p>

<p>4. Focus on behavior rather than the person.</p>

<p>5. Refer to behavior that can be changed.</p>

<p>6. Be descriptive rather than evaluative.</p>

<p>7. Own the feedback -- Use &#145;I&#146; statements.</p>

<p>8. Generalizations -- Notice &#147;all,&#148; &#147;never,&#148;
&#147;always,&#148; etc., and ask to get more specificity -- often
these words are arbitrary limits on behavior.</p>

<p>9. Be very careful with advice -- People rarely struggle with
an issue because of the lack of some specific piece of information;
often, the best help is helping the person to come to a better
understanding of their issue, how it developed, and how they can
identify actions to address the issue more effectively.</p>

<h2>Addressing Performance Issues</h2>

<p>(Note that if your organization's policies about performance
management indicate a specific procedure for handling performance
issues, that procedure should be followed very carefully. Otherwise,
a court may interpret your official policies to be modified by
how you actually handled a performance issue and you may lose
protection from your related policies in court.)</p>

<p>1. <b>Note that performance issues should always be based on
behaviors that you see, not on characteristics of the employee's
personality</b></p>

<p>2. <b>Convey performance issues to employees when you see first
see the issues!</b><br />
Don't wait until the performance review! Worse yet, don't ignore
the behaviors in case they &quot;go away.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <b>When you first convey a performance issue to an employee,
say what you noticed and would like to see instead</b><br />
Be specific about what you saw that you consider to be a performance
problem. Ask the employee for feedback. Ask the employee if there's
any special training or more resources they need to do their job.
Explore if the job is configured so that most people would probably
fail, and so the job needs to be redesigned. Tell them that you
want the behavior to improve. If they react strongly and claim
they will quit, give them a day to think it over. In any case,
remind them that you support them in their role.</p>

<p>4. <b>Consider special circumstances:</b><br />
You can usually fire someone if they committed certain gross acts,
such as theft, blatant insubordination, a major impropriety, e.g.,
telling information to competitors or spreading confidential information
about customers, etc. However, if there is poor performance or
chronic absenteeism because of potential verified alcoholism or
depression, it's best to consult an expert to deal with this situation.)</p>

<p>5. <b>Make notes about the first meeting and its results, and
keep it in a file for yourself</b><br />
This note may come in handy later on if the performance problem
persists. (In the case of a corporation, you might mention the
situation to your board. The board will likely be a precious and
objective asset to dealing with this situation, especially if
things with the employee get worse.)</p>

<p>6. <b>If the problem occurs again over the next month or two,
immediately issue them a written warning</b><br />
In the memo, clearly specify what you saw, mention the previous
meeting and its date, say the behaviors have not improved, warn
them that if this occurs again over some period (e.g., the next
month), they will be promptly terminated. Meet with them to provide
them the memo. If you are convinced that the employee is trying
hard, but can't improve, consider placing him or her elsewhere
in the organization. Attempt to have this meeting on other than
on a Friday. Otherwise, employees are left to ruminate about the
situation without ready access to you for at least three days.
(In the case of corporations, update the board.)</p>

<p>7. <b>On the third occurrence, consider firing the employee.
(See below.)</b></p>

<h2>Conducting Performance Appraisals/Reviews</h2>

<p>Yearly performance reviews are critical. Organization's are
hard pressed to find good reasons why they can't dedicate an hour-long
meeting at least once a year to ensure the mutual needs of the
employee and organization are being met. Performance reviews help
supervisors feel more honest in their relationships with their
subordinates and feel better about themselves in their supervisoral
roles. Subordinates are assured clear understanding of what's
expected from them, their own personal strengths and areas for
development and a solid sense of their relationship with their
supervisor. Avoiding performance issues ultimately decreases morale,
decreases credibility of management, decreases the organization's
overall effectiveness and wastes more of management's time. Conduct
the following activities.</p>

<p>1. <b>Design a legally valid performance review process; consider
these legal requirements of the performance review process:</b><br />
Patricia King, in her book, <i>Performance Planning and Appraisal,</i>
states that the law requires that performance appraisals be:
job-related and valid; based on a thorough analysis of the job;
standardized for all employees; not biased against any race, color,
sex, religion, or nationality; and performed by people who have
adequate knowledge of the person or job. Be sure to build in the
process, a route for recourse if an employee feels he or she has
been dealt with unfairly in an appraisal process, e.g., that the
employee can go to his or her supervisor's supervisor. The process
should be clearly described in a personnel policy.</p>

<p>2. <b>Design a standard form for performance appraisals</b><br />
and include the name of the employee, date the performance form
was completed, dates specifying the time interval over which the
employee is being evaluated, performance dimensions (include responsibilities
from the job description, any assigned goals from the strategic
plan, along with needed skills, such as communications, administration,
etc.), a rating system (e.g., poor, average, good, excellent),
space for commentary for each dimension, a final section for overall
commentary, a final section for action plans to address improvements,
and lines for signatures of the supervisor and employee. Signatures
may either specify that the employee accepts the appraisal or
has seen it, depending on wording on the form.</p>

<p>3. <b>Schedule the first performance review for six months
after the employee starts employment</b><br />
Schedule another six months later, and then every year on the
employee's anniversary date.</p>

<p>4. <b>Initiate the performance review</b><br />
Tell the employee that you're initiating a scheduled performance
review. Remind them of what's involved in the process. Schedule
a meeting about two weeks out.</p>

<p>5. <b>Have the employee suggest any updates to the job description
and provide written input to the appraisal</b><br />
(Note that by now, employees should have received the job descriptions
and goals well in advance of the review, i.e., a year before.
The employee should also be familiar with the performance appraisal
procedure and form.) Have them record their input to the appraisal
concurrent to the your recording yours. Have them record their
input on their own sheets (their feedback will be combined on
the official form later on in the process). You and the employee
can exchange each of your written feedback in the upcoming review
meeting.</p>

<p>6. <b>Record your input to the appraisal -- always reference
the job description and associated formal goals for basis of review</b><br />
Be sure you are familiar with the job requirements and have sufficient
contact with the employee to be making valid judgments. Don't
comment on the employee's race, sex, religion, nationality, or
a handicap or veteran status. Record major accomplishments, exhibited
strengths and weaknesses according to the dimensions on the appraisal
form, and suggest actions and training or development to improve
performance. Use examples of behaviors wherever you can in the
appraisal to help avoid counting on hearsay. Always address behaviors,
not characteristics of personalities. The best way to follow this
guideline is to consider what you saw with your eyes. Be sure
to address only the behaviors of that employee, rather than behaviors
of other employees.</p>

<p>7. <b>Hold the performance appraisal meeting</b><br />
State the meeting's goals of exchanging feedback and coming to
action plans, where necessary. In the meeting, let the employee
speak first and give their input. Respond with your own input.
Then discuss areas where you disagree. Attempt to avoid defensiveness;
admitting how you feel at the present time, helps a great deal.
Discuss behaviors, not personalities. Avoid final terms such as
&quot;always,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; etc. Encourage participation
and be supportive. Come to terms on actions, where possible. Try
to end the meeting on a positive note.</p>

<p>8. <b>Update and finalize the performance appraisal form</b><br />
Add agreed-to commentary on to the form. Note that if the employee
wants to add attach written input to the final form, he or she
should be able to do so. The supervisor signs the form and asks
the employee to sign it. The form and its action plans are reviewed
every few months, usually during one-on-one meetings with the
employee.</p>

<p>9. <b>Note that if the supervisor has been doing a good job
supervising, then nothing should be surprising to the employee
during the appraisal</b><br />
Any performance issues should have been conveyed when they occurred,
so nothing should be a surprise in the review meeting.</p>

<h2>Firing Employees</h2>

<p>1. <b>You should consider firing the employee only if you have:</b><br />
a) given the employee clear indication of what you originally
expected from him or her (via a written job description previously
provided to the him or her); <br />
b) have clearly written personnel policies which specify conditions
and directions about firing employees and the employee initialized
a copy of the policy handbook to verify that he or she had read
the policies; <br />
c) warned the employee in successive and dated memos which clearly
described degrading performance over a specified time despite
your specific and recorded offers of assistance and any training
(the number of memos depends on the nature of the problem, but
should be no more than three or four); and <br />
d) you clearly observe the employee still having the performance
problem. <br />
(Note that if the employee is being fired within a probationary
period specified in your personnel policies, you may not have
to meet all of the above conditions.)</p>

<p>2. <b>Take a day or so to consider what you are about to do.</b><br />
Consult with members of your board (in the case of corporations).</p>

<p>3. <b>If you still decide to fire the employee, do so promptly</b><br />
both for your credibility with other employees and so as not begin
procrastinating about this rather painful, upcoming event.</p>

<p>4. <b>Write a letter of termination to the employee.</b><br />
As with the previous letters of warning, be clear about the observed
behaviors, when you saw them, earlier warnings and their consequences,
what you did in response, and the consequence that must now be
enacted according to your policies.</p>

<p>5. <b>Tell the computer system administrator to change the
employee's password</b><br />
and assert that this action should be done promptly and in complete
confidence.</p>

<p>6. <b>Meet with the employee. Provide them the letter. Explain
how the termination will occur,</b> including when, what they
must do, what you request from them and when. Ask for any keys.
Give them a half hour or so to remove personal items (you may
choose to monitor them during this removal, depending on the nature
of the grounds for dismissal). Consider changing the door locks
to the facilities. Change the passwords on phone systems, if applicable.</p>

<p>7. <b>As with other meetings, make notes of what was said and
exchanged.</b><br />
Keep them in your records.</p>

<h2>=== PERSONNEL POLICIES ===</h2>

<p><a name="anchor780919"></a></p>

<h2>Developing Personnel Policies</h2>

<h3>Need for Personnel Policies</h3>

<p>From review of the above personnel management information,
it's clear that there are numerous considerations and potential
areas for litigation when dealing with personnel issues. There
are numerous rules and regulations which regulate the nature of
the relationship between an employee and his or her organization,
e.g., about affirmative action, managing personnel files, employee
retirement, rights of privacy, discrimination and harassment,
wrongful termination, etc. Consequently, it's better to have thought
out these potentially controversial situations before they occur
and establish guidelines by which they might or will be addressed.
These general guidelines are called policies. Specific activities
resulting from the guidelines are often called procedures.</p>

<h3>Developing Personnel Policies</h3>

<p>Each organization should carefully consider what policies it
requires and how they should worded. Many organizations begin
developing their personnel policies by reviewing policies from
other organizations. This is fine as long the organization carefully
reviews each policy, modifies them according to the nature and
needs of the organization and has all policies approved by the
board (in the case of corporations).</p>

<p>When developing policies, always consult a lawyer who's well
versed in federal, state and local laws regarding employment practices,
e.g., the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/employee-laws/laws/civil-rights.htm"
class="textlink">Employee Law -- Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>,
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992, and Occupational Safety
and Health Acts. Personnel policies may need to be governed to
by union rules or other contractual agreements.</p>

<p>Note that the online information referenced from these Web
pages and the associated examples should be considered as guidance,
rather than as policies to be adopted as is for any organization.</p>

<h3>Training on Policies</h3>

<p>Note that if management's behaviors do not conform to the personnel
policies, courts will consider the related policies to be superseded
by the behaviors. Therefore, it's critical that management have
basic understanding of the major points made in each personnel
policy.</p>

<p>Consider setting aside a half day per year for employees to
review the policies and procedures to ensure they are up-to-date.
Any recommended changes should be discussed with and approved
by the board (in the case of corporations).</p>

<p>In addition, each employee should have a manual that includes
all personnel policies. (See below.)</p>

<p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

  

<p><a name="anchor62414"></a></p>

<h2>Developing an Employee Manual</h2>

<p>Document all intended policies and procedures and collect them
in a policies and procedures manual. Having all policies and procedures
in a manual facilitates training about them to all employees.
All employees should have read the manual to understand and accept
its contents. They should sign a form indicating so, and provide
the signed form to the organization's administrator.</p>

<p>All supervisors should be trained about the policies and procedures.
A large number of suits brought against organizations is because,
although the organizations had clear policies, supervisors did
not enact the policies because they did not understand them. Note
that courts may consider policies and procedures as superseded
by the actual behaviors displayed by supervisors.</p>

<p>The board (in the case of corporations) should authorize all
policies in the manual and every employee should receive a copy
of the manual.</p>

<p>Each policy should include wording to the effect that the policies
are for general guidance in the relationships between employees
and the organization, the board (in the case of corporations)
has authorized the policy, that policies can be changed at any
time and that the policies do not constitute a contract between
the organization and the employee. Consider the following wording
on the cover of your policies manual:</p>

<p><i>&quot;Nothing contained in or implied by this manual creates
or shall be deemed to create or constitute a contractual obligation
to employees on the part (of the organization). The policies,
procedures and guidelines contained in this manual are subject
to change at any time, do not confer any obligation (on the part
of the organization) and do not create any right to employment
on the part (of the organization).&quot;</i></p>
