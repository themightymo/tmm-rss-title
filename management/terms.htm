<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to get a sense about the practices
of management is to examine key terms in management. These key
terms are defined below. Definitions in this document are quite
basic and general in nature.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1005607"></a></p>

<h2>Board of Directors</h2>

<p>A board is a group of people who are legally charged to govern
an organization (usually a corporation) -- thus, they are &quot;governing
boards.&quot; The board is responsible for setting strategic direction,
establishing broad policies and objectives, and hiring and evaluating
the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer reports
to the board and is responsible for carrying out the board's strategic
policies. The nature of a board can vary widely in nature. Some
boards act like &quot;policy boards&quot;, that is, they take
a strong policy-making role, and expect the chief executive to
operate the organization according to those policies. Some boards,
despite their being legally responsible for the activities of
the corporation, follow all of the directions and guidance of
the chief executive (in this case, board members arguably are
not meeting their responsibilities as a board). Still, other boards
take a strong &quot;working board&quot;, or hands-on role, including
micro-managing the chief executive and organization. For more
information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm">Boards
of Directors</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor654851"></a></p>

<h2>Management</h2>

<h3>Traditional Interpretation</h3>

<p>There are a variety of views about this term. Traditionally,
the term &quot;management&quot; refers to the activities (and
often the group of people) involved in the four general functions
listed below. (Note that the four functions recur throughout the
organization and are highly integrated):</p>

<p>1) Planning, <br />
including identifying goals, objectives, methods, resources needed
to carry out methods, responsibilities and dates for completion
of tasks. Examples of planning are strategic planning, business
planning, project planning, staffing planning, advertising and
promotions planning, etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm">Planning
(many kinds)</a>.)</p>

<p>2) Organizing resources <br />
to achieve the goals in an optimum fashion. Examples are organizing
new departments, human resources, office and file systems, re-organizing
businesses, etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizing/index.htm">Organizing
(many kinds)</a>.)</p>

<p>3) Leading,<br />
including to set direction for the organization, groups and individuals
and also influence people to follow that direction. Examples are
establishing strategic direction (vision, values, mission and
/ or goals) and championing methods of organizational performance
management to pursue that direction. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm">All
About Leadership</a>.)</p>

<p>4) Controlling, or coordinating, <br />
the organization's systems, processes and structures to reach
effectively and efficiently reach goals and objectives. This includes
ongoing collection of feedback, and monitoring and adjustment
of systems, processes and structures accordingly. Examples include
use of financial controls, policies and procedures, performance
management processes, measures to avoid risks etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/managementcontrol/index.htm">Coordinating
Activities</a>.)</p>

<p>Another common view is that &quot;management&quot; is getting
things done through others. Yet another view, quite apart from
the traditional view, asserts that the job of management is to
support employee's efforts to be fully productive members of the
organizations and citizens of the community.</p>

<p>To most employees, the term &quot;management&quot; probably
means the group of people (executives and other managers) who
are primarily responsible for making decisions in the organization.
In a nonprofit, the term &quot;management&quot; might refer to
all or any of the activities of the board, executive director
and/or program directors.</p>

<p>Read the rest of the overall topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/management/index.htm">Management
(Introduction)</a> to understand more about management.</p>

 

<h3>Another Interpretation</h3>

<p>Some writers, teachers and practitioners assert that the above
view is rather outmoded and that management needs to focus more
on leadership skills, e.g., establishing vision and goals, communicating
the vision and goals, and guiding others to accomplish them. They
also assert that leadership must be more facilitative, participative
and empowering in how visions and goals are established and carried
out. Some people assert that this really isn't a change in the
management functions, rather it's re-emphasizing certain aspects
of management. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/management/paradigms.htm">New
Paradigm in Management.</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor850098"></a></p>

<h2>Executives</h2>

<p>Usually, this term generally applies to those people or specific
positions in top levels of management, e.g., chief executive officers,
chief operating officers, chief financial officers, vice presidents,
general managers of large organizations, etc. In large organizations,
executives often have different forms of compensation or pay,
e.g., they receive portions of the company's stock, receive executive-level
&quot;perks, etc. Chief executives usually pay strong attention
to strategic plans and organizational performance, whether measured
financially or from impact of services to a community. Many people
think of the Chief Executive Officer as heading up large, for-profit
corporations. This is not entirely true. The majority of businesses
in the United States are small businesses, whether for-profit
or nonprofit. Their top executives could be called Chief Executive
Officers. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/chiefexecutives/index.htm">Chief
Executive Role.</a></p>

 

<h3>&quot;Leading versus Managing&quot;?</h3>

<p>(Whatever the title, the person in the top-level position in
the organization is (or at least should be) responsible for setting
(or, in the case of corporations, pursuing) the overall direction
for the organization. Consequently (and unfortunately?), this
&quot;executive&quot; level of management is often referred to
as the &quot;leadership&quot; of the organization.)</p>

<p>With recent focus on the need for transformational leadership
to guide organizations through successful change, the term &quot;leadership&quot;
has also been used to refer to those who embrace change and lead
the change of organizations for the betterment of all stakeholders.
Some people believe that leadership occurs only at the top levels
of organizations and managing occurs in the levels farther down
the organization. Some people believe that leadership occurs (or
should occur) throughout the organization, but still use the term
&quot;leadership&quot; mostly to refer to the top positions in
the organization. Others believe that managing and leading occur
at many levels of the organization. For more information, see
<br />
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor293932">Is
Leading Different than Managing? (pros and cons of this debate)</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor656686"></a></p>

<h2>Managers</h2>

<p>A classic definition is that &#147;Leaders do the right thing
and managers do things right.&#148; A more standard definition
is usually something like &#147;managers work toward the organization&#146;s
goals using its resources in an effective and efficient manner.&#148;
In a traditional sense, large organizations may have different
levels of managers, including top managers, middle managers and
first-line managers. <b>Top (or executive) managers</b> are responsible
for overseeing the whole organization and typically engage in
more strategic and conceptual matters, with less attention to
day-to-day detail. Top managers have middle managers working for
them and who are in charge of a major function or department.
<b>Middle managers</b> may have <b>first-line managers</b> working
for them and who are responsible to manage the day-to-day activities
of a group of workers.</p>

<p>Note that you can also have different types of managers across
the same levels in the organization. A <b>project manager</b>
is in charge of developing a certain project, e.g., development
of a new building. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/projectmanagement/index.htm">Project
Planning.</a>) A <b>functional manager</b> is in charge of a major
function, such as a department in the organization, e.g., marketing,
sales, engineering, finance, etc. (For example, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/programmanagement/index.htm">Program
Planning</a>) A <b>product manager</b> is in charge of a product
or service. Similarly, a <b>product line</b> manager is in charge
of a group of closely related products. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/index.htm">Product/Service
Management</a>.) <b>General managers</b> are in charge of numerous
functions within an organization or department.</p>

<p><a name="anchor662641"></a></p>

<h2>Supervisors</h2>

<p>(This is a widely misunderstood term. Many people believe it
applies only to people who oversee the productivity and development
of entry-level workers. That's not true.) The term &quot;supervisor&quot;
typically refers to one&#146;s immediate superior in the workplace,
that is, the person whom you report directly to in the organization.
For example, a middle manager&#146;s supervisor typically would
be a top manager. A first-line manager&#146;s supervisor would
be a middle manager. A worker&#146;s supervisor typically would
be a first-line manager.</p>

<p>Supervisors typically are responsible for their direct reports'
progress and productivity in the organization. Supervision often
includes conducting basic management skills (decision making,
problem solving, planning, delegation and meeting management),
organizing teams, noticing the need for and designing new job
roles in the group, hiring new employees, training new employees,
employee performance management (setting goals, observing and
giving feedback, addressing performance issues, firing employees,
etc.) and ensuring conformance to personnel policies and other
internal regulations.</p>

<p>Supervisors typically have strong working knowledge of the
activities in their group, e.g., how to develop their product,
carry out their service, etc. Many also use the term &quot;supervisor&quot;
to designate the managerial position that is responsible for a
major function in the organization, for example, Supervisor of
Customer Service. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/index.htm">Basic
Overview of Supervision</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor4293161993"></a></p>

<h2>Work Directors</h2>

<p>Work directors directly oversee the work of their subordinates.
They carry out their oversight role by specifically assigning
work and then closely monitoring to ensure the work is carried
out according to their wishes. Often, people work their way up
through management levels by starting out as work directors. Over
time, they develop skills in delegation, which frees them up from
having to closely monitor the work of their subordinates and,
instead, to attend to more high-level managerial activities. Work
directors are not always at lower levels of the organization.
For example, a middle- or upper-level manager who has poorly developed
delegation skills might still be interpreted as work directing
her or his subordinates.</p>

<p><a name="anchor4293159409"></a></p>

<h2>Individual Contributors</h2>

<p>This term is often used to refer to entry-level and/or first-line
employees who do not have employees reporting to them.</p>

<p><a name="anchor661963"></a></p>

<h2>Leaders</h2>

<p>Very simply put, a leader is interpreted as someone who sets
direction in an effort and influences people to follow that direction.
They set direction by developing a clear vision and mission, and
conducting planning that determines the goals needed to achieve
the vision and mission. They motivate by using a variety of methods,
including facilitation, coaching, mentoring, directing, delegating,
etc. As noted above, one of the four key functions of management
is leading (along with planning, organizing and controlling).
Leaders carry out their roles in a wide variety of styles, e.g.,
autocratic, democratic, participatory, laissez-faire (hands off),
etc. Often, the leadership style depends on the situation, including
the life cycle of the organization. There are many views about
what characteristics and traits that leaders should have. There
are also numerous theories about leadership, or about carrying
out the role of leader, e.g., servant leader, democratic leader,
principle-centered leader, group-man theory, great-man theory,
traits theory, visionary leader, total leader, situational leader,
etc.</p>

<p>As note above, many people assert that leading is different
than managing. See<br />
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor293932">Is
Leading Different than Managing? (pros and cons of this debate)</a></p>

<p>(This term is commonly misapplied when people use the term
mostly to refer to the top levels in an organization. The term
has -- and should have -- much broader usage. Anyone at any level
in an organization can show leadership; thus, almost anyone can
be a leader in the organization)</p>

<h2>Boards of Directors / Governance Development</h2>

<p>Board / Governance development refers to the activities involved
in enhancing skills of the corporation's board members to effectively
fill their role in governing the corporation. Board development
typically includes helping board members to understand their role
of boards, build skills in recruiting and training board members,
carry out effective board meetings, make policy decisions about
strategic goals and finances, evaluate the board and chief executive
officer, etc. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm">Boards
of Directors</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor809032"></a></p>

<h2>Management Development</h2>

<p>Usually, this term refers to the activities involved in enhancing
leaders', managers' and supervisor's abilities to plan, organize,
lead and control the organization and its members. Consequently,
many view the term &quot;management development&quot; to include
executive development (developing executives), leadership development
(developing leaders), managerial development (developing managers)
and supervisoral development (developing supervisors). For more
information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/management/development/index.htm">Management
Development</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, there are people who assert a strong difference
between &quot;leading&quot; and &quot;managing&quot;. These people
often refer to leadership development (developing skills in leadership)
as apart from management (and managerial) development (developing
skills in planning, organizing and controlling). See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm#anchor293932">Leading
Versus Managing (pros and cons of the debate)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor670380"></a></p>

<h2>Executive Development</h2>

<p>(Today's organizations are changing dramatically. Successful
change requires strong leadership from top positions in the organizations.
Therefore, writers often interchange use of the phrases &quot;leadership
development&quot; with &quot;executive development&quot;. They
are not the same. As noted above, this is handy, but it can cause
substantial confusion.)</p>

<p>Executive development refers to the activities involved in
enhancing one's ability to carry out top-level roles in the organization.
Some key skills for executives to have include understanding the
external environment of the organization, leadership, strategic
planning, financial forecasting and analysis, organizing, program
planning and human resource management, etc. For more information,
see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/chiefexecutives/index.htm">Chief
Executive Role.</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor981662"></a></p>

<h2>Managerial Development</h2>

<p>This term is not frequently used. When it is, it is usually
used meant in the same regard as management development.</p>

<p><a name="anchor670633"></a></p>

<h2>Supervisoral Development</h2>

<p>Supervisoral development refers to the activities involved
in enhancing one's ability to oversee, guide and evaluate activities
of immediate subordinates in the organization. Supervisor development
often includes learning basic skills in employee performance management,
managing meetings, project management, etc. Good supervisory development
should also include developing skills in time and stress management
-- the role of supervisor is often quite stressful to those who
are first getting used to the hectic activities of management.
For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/development/index.htm">Supervisoral
Development</a>.</p>

<p><a name="anchor669948"></a></p>

<h2>Leadership Development</h2>

<p>Leadership development refers to the activities involved in
enhancing one's ability to establish vision and goals, and motivate
and guide others to achieve the vision and goals. Leadership development
is critical at almost <i>any</i> level in the organization --
not just the executive level. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/development/index.htm">Leadership
Development</a>.</p>
