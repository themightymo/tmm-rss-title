<p>Simply put, management development is an effort (hopefully,
planned in nature) that enhances the learner's capacity to manage
organizations (or oneself). Very simply put, managing includes
activities of planning, organizing, leading and coordinating resources.
A critical skill for anyone is the ability to manage their own
learning. The highly motivated, self-directed reader can gain
a great deal of learning and other results from using the guidelines
and materials in this library topic.</p>

<h2>PREPARATION FOR LEARNING</h2>

<p><a name="anchor1855581"></a></p>

<h2>Optional -- Suggested Reading as Preparation</h2>

<p>To gain broad perspective on management development, the reader
would benefit most from first reading the following information.
<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/org_thry/org_thry.htm">Introduction
to Organizations (read the section titled the &quot;Basics&quot;)</a><br />

<p><a name="anchor945421"></a></p>

<h2>Before Management Development, Get Impression of &quot;Management&quot;</h2>

<p>The first place to start learning about management is to get
some sense of what management is -- in particular, understand
get an impression of the areas of knowledge and skills recommended
for effective management in organizations. Review information
in: <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/index.htm">Management
(Introduction)</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/skills.htm">Skills
and Practices in Organizational Management</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1578094"></a></p>

<h2>What Does Management Development Look Like?</h2>

<h3>Let's Look at Some Programs</h3>

<p>If you read the information in the section <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm#anchor918135"
class="textlink">Training Basics -- Understanding Learning and
Development</a> listed above, you learned about training programs
that are informal and formal, and other-directed or self-directed.
Management development programs come in all of these combinations,
as well. You can learn about management in informal &quot;programs&quot;,
for example, by reading some articles, discussing management with
a friend, etc. You can attend formal training, for example, a
course, seminar or workshop. At this point, it might help you
to get some perspective on the nature of management development
programs by looking at some. See<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/development/index.htm">Examples
of Management Development Programs</a></p>

<h3>History of Management Development</h3>

<p>It might be interesting for you to get a brief overview of
the history of management development, in order to give you broader
perspective and understanding of current management development
methods. <br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/theories.htm">Historical and Contemporary Theories in Management</a></p>

<h3>What the Future Holds for Management Development Programs</h3>

<p>As organizations have faced a new paradigm (see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/paradigms.htm"
class="textlink">New Paradigm in Management</a>), management development
organizations must embrace a new paradigm as well. To get an impression
of changes that must be made, read<br />

Often Unmet Needs from Training and Development Programs</a><br />
</p>

<p><a name="anchor1585084"></a></p>

<h2>Strong Value of Self-Directed Learning</h2>

<p>The ability to manage one's own learning is an increasingly
critical skill. Bouchard explains, &#147;Over the years, it has
become increasingly clear that traditional approaches to [training!!]
program design and delivery in the workplace and in associative
organizations present some important weaknesses. Problem areas
include: coping with the short life span of useful knowledge;
passing down acquired competencies to succeeding cohorts; accommodating
the demands of productivity while providing for a continuity of
learning; [and!!] enabling learners to pursue activities that
correspond to their learning styles and needs&#148; (in <i>Self-Directed
Learning in Organizational Settings</i> (working paper), Concordia
University, Montreal, Canada, p. 1).</p>

<p>This topic in the library provides an excellent opportunity
to begin managing your learning. To learn more about self-directed
learning, see<br />

<h2>INFORMAL ACTIVITIES TO LEARN ABOUT MANAGEMENT</h2>

<p><a name="anchor1593659"></a></p>

<h2>Informal Activities to Learn About Management</h2>

<p><a name="anchor1594299"></a></p>

<h3>Attempt to Go Beyond Reading Books ...</h3>

<p>There are a wide range of everyday and on-the-job activities
from which you can learn about management and even enhance your
management skills. Informal methods can include, for example,
reading books, having discussions with friends, on-the-job training,
keeping a diary with thoughts about management, etc. One of the
more insidious ways to avoid learning to manage is by reading
lots of books about management, rather than actually implementing
any of the advice offered in any of them. You're not likely to
develop much for management skills merely by reading, talking
or attending a course unless you actually apply new materials
and methods, and continue to reflect on what you're learning along
the way.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1604610"></a></p>

<h3>Ideas for Activities to Learn About Management</h3>

<p>One of the most effective and reliable ways to learn is to
do so consciously, in a planned fashion. Therefore, be sure to
consider customizing your own management training plan. Complete
guidelines are provided in the next section, <a href="#anchor1609567"

<h2>CUSTOMIZING YOUR OWN MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PLAN</h2>

<p>Your are much more likely to learn useful skills in management
if you develop and implement a training plan. The following sections
will guide you to develop your own complete, highly integrated
(and performance-oriented) management development plan. Each section
includes reference to particular sections in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm"
class="textlink">Complete Guidelines to Design Your Training and
Development Plan</a> (hereafter called the &quot;Guidelines&quot;).
That document includes guidelines for you to identify your overall
training goals and the learning objectives and activities to achieve
the goals. Guidelines are also provided for carrying out the learning
activities and evaluating your entire learning experience.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1857831"></a></p>

<h2>Preparation for Designing Your Management Training Plan</h2>

<p>Read the following two initial sections of the Guidelines (up
to &quot;Determining Your Overall Goals in Training&quot;) and
then return to the next section below.<br />

<h2>Identifying Your Overall Goals in Management Training</h2>

<h3>Purpose of this Section</h3>

<p>This section helps you identify what you want to be able to
do as a result of implementing your training plan, for example,
qualify for a certain job, overcome a performance problem, meet
a goal in your career development plan, etc. Learners are often
better off to work towards at most two to four goals at a time.
There are a variety of ways to identify your training goals, depending
on what you want to be able to accomplish as a result of implementing
your training plan.</p>

<h3>Begin Identifying Your Training Goals</h3>

<h4>Consider Performance Gaps, Growth Gaps or Opportunities Gaps</h4>
<p>Performance gaps are areas of knowledge and skills need to improve performance 
  and are usually indicated during performance reviews with your supervisor. Growth 
  gaps are areas of knowledge and skills need to reach a career goal. Opportunity 
  gaps are areas of knowledge and skills needed to take advantage of an upcoming 
  opportunity.</p>

<h4>Conduct Self-Assessments</h4>
<p>The following online, self-assessments may help, as well, by helping you assess 
  certain areas of your own management abilities.<br />

<h4>Collect Input From Others</h4>
<p>Ask others for ideas to improve your management skills. Try get their input 
  in terms of behaviors you can show. Consider input from performance reviews. 
  See<br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/performance-appraisals.htm">Performance 
  Reviews / Appraisals</a></p>

<h4>Reference Lists of Areas of Knowledge and Skills Needed in Variety of Roles 
  and Function</h4>
<p>Competencies are lists of the general abilities needed to perform a role. Consider 
  the following lists for managing yourself and carrying out major functions in 
  management. <br />

  Competencies in Management Development</a></p>
<h4>Reference Books and Other Materials About Management</h4>
<p>There is a vast amount of information available regarding management and management 
  skills. However, much of it is in regard to character traits that managers should 
  have. When determining your training goals, translate these character traits 
  to behaviors that you and others can recognize. See <br />
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/mng_thry/suggstns.htm">Various Suggestions 
  for Knowledge and Skills Needed in Management</a></p>
<h4>Look at Goals and Objectives of Management Development Programs</h4>
<p>These programs can offer good ideas about traits and characteristics needed 
  by managers, and methods to achieve those traits and characteristics. Be careful 
  not to simply adopt suggestions and methods without first considering if they'd 
  really be useful to you. <br />

<h2>Determining Your Learning Objectives and Activities</h2>

<h3>Purpose of this Section</h3>

<p>The purpose of this section is to identify the various learning
objectives you should achieve and learning activities you should
undertake in order to achieve the overall training goals in your
plan.</p>

<h3>Identifying Your Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>Carefully consider each of your training goals. What specifically
must be accomplished (that is, what objectives must be reached)
in order for you to reach those goals? Which of these objectives
require learning new areas of knowledge or skills? These objectives
are likely to become learning objectives in your training plan.
To get a stronger sense for learning objectives, see <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm">Basic
Guidelines (and Examples) for Writing Learning Objectives</a>.</p>

<h3>Identifying Your Learning Activities</h3>

<p>Learning activities are the activities you will conduct in order to reach the 
  learning objectives. The activities should help you work toward your training 
  goal, accommodate your particular learning styles, be accessible to you and 
  be enjoyable as well. The following link might help you. <br />
