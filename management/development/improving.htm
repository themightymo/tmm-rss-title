<h1>Thoughts About Improving Management Training and Development
Programs</h1>

<!--[index|Training and Development]-->
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter

<p>Management educators, writers and leaders all assert that leading
and managing an organization will only get more complex and challenging
in the future. Therefore, management development programs must
evolve to become even more accessible and relevant. Look for these
future enhancements to management training and development programs
in universities, colleges and training centers.</p>

<p>Future management training and development programs will:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Include more courses about methods of organization development</b>.<br />
  This topic will include understanding various typical problems
  that occur in organizations, how to diagnose them, the variety
  of interventions to solve the problems, evaluating the interventions
  and adjusting policies and procedures to avoid the problems in
  the future. (There&#146;s a growing body of information in this
  regard.)</li>
  <li><b>Involve well beyond Fortune 500 companies when designing
  programs</b>.<br />
  Input to programs design will include leaders who are representative
  of a broad range of organizations, including small business and
  non-profit. These organizations are at the fore-front of commerce
  and progress in our society -- yet many cannot afford necessary
  means to leadership development.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot methods to make management development programs
  more accessible</b>.<br />
  For example, two introductory or foundation courses will be held
  at a lower tuition rate, rather than one highly abstract course
  at a higher rate. With wise use of adjuncts or community faculty
  (and there are many available), two courses need not cost twice
  as much as one.</li>
  <li><b>Keep experienced-based expertise to complement academic
  knowledge</b>.<br />
  Use of adjuncts or community faculty bring in experienced-based
  perspective that strongly complements academic expertise, resulting
  in meaningful courses which remain state-of-the-art, yet grounded
  in the day-to-day realities of running an organization. Word
  quickly spreads among learners about truly meaningful courses,
  which, in turn, provokes strong demand for the courses along
  with long-lasting stature and credibility for the school.</li>
  <li><b>Go beyond theory and competencies-based models to pilot
  more ongoing, process-oriented and reflective approaches</b>.<br />
  These approaches reflect the realities of running an organization
  while developing the reflective skills to &#147;learn how to
  learn.&#148; They spawn the dialogue necessary to retain any
  sense of meaning in today&#146;s chaotic and complex world of
  management. They also spawn the support necessary for learners
  to actually apply what they learn.</li>
  <li><b>Exploit the leverage in leadership development to be gained
  from piloting self-organized groups of learners</b>.<br />
  These groups provide highly accessible means to ongoing support,
  complex problem solving and continuous learning. These groups
  can be spawned at low-cost and produce a high volume of &#147;grassroots&#148;
  development &#147;courses&#148; where leaders are taught how
  to help each other. These groups can complement traditional classroom-based
  training methods; they need not replace them.</li>
  <li><b>Pilot means to address increasing burnout and cynicism
  in leaders</b>.<br />
  Management development does not occur in a safe vacuum devoid
  of the challenges of self-management. Burnout and cynicism are
  not addressed through intellectual rigor -- addressing both requires
  highly accessible and ongoing forums for venting, dialogue and
  exchange.</li>
  <li><b>Develop evaluation methods to be based more on indicators
  of effectiveness in learners&#146; organizations and less on
  learners&#146; reactions to courses</b>.<br />
  Learners are increasingly skeptical of the explosion of seminars
  and workshops that promise a great deal, but leave their students
  temporarily feeling good. Learners, trainers and developers need
  a great deal of help now to learn how to separate style from
  substance.</li>
  <li><b>Recognize the value of ongoing support to learners and
  leaders</b>.<br />
  Particularly in today's rapidly changing world, it can be tremendously
  stressful to lead or manage an organization. In these times of
  stress, it's often quite difficult to intellectually grasp a
  vast array of intellectual information, store it away for later
  reference, know when to retrieve it and then readily apply it
  to the current major challenge in the workplace. A strong foundation
  of ongoing support can help learners and leaders to keep an open
  mind to new information, explore various new values and viewpoints,
  and then have the courage to apply this new information in the
  workplace. This strong foundation of ongoing support is every
  bit as much a piece of training and development as is a new binder
  of new information in a course.</li>
