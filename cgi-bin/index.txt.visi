For example, a lack of fully trained resources (trained in the company’s way of marketing) can force marketing projects to be delayed, which can lead to loss of sales or delay to the market with the formal release of a new product.||

9/12/2010|Form to add content|art@operationsmanager.com ||www.operationsmanagment.com |Difference between Operations Managers and General Managers|Operations Management |In any organization, good leadership is required for growth and success, and is always cherished. For this reason, the position of a General Manager and Operations Manager are considered paramount. But what is the nature of the job of Operations Managers and General Managers that make them so important? What is the difference between Operations Managers and General Managers? Let’s look at the answers to these questions. First, let’s find out about the position of the General Manager.

General Manager:

General Managers are a part of a lot of activities in the business. They manage all the portions of all the operations of the business. Administrative services, human resources, operations, policies and procedures and accounts are just some areas where General Managers are directly or indirectly involved. For this reason, General Managers are required in every business and every industry.

Looking at human resources, a General Manager has the responsibility of recruiting, training and selecting candidates, with the help of the human resource department of the company. When the human resource department is in charge of recruiting, the General Manager ensures that the quality of organizational training is maintained to a certain level. A General Manager may also participate in evaluating the performance or reviewing the feedback of employees.

Another important role of the General Manager is that of a communication link between the management of the company and its staff. Reviewing and monitoring the performance of the employees and directing them to the goals and targets of the company are the jobs of a General Manager. Next let’s take a look at Operations Managers.

Operations Managers:

The roles and responsibility of an Operations Manager are similar to that of a General Manager in many ways. Operations Managers chalk out efficient strategies for the profit and financial growth of the company. An Operations Manager works in tandem with the finance department, human resource department, accounts department and many other such departments within the company.

An Operations Manager is responsible for increasing the efficiency of a business’s product and services. For this reason, Operations Managers maintain discipline among the employees and motivate them to improve their output. In terms of production, Operations Managers make financial decisions for purchasing items and manage the company’s budget. If they find new techniques to improve the performance of the employees, they implement them. Operations Managers deal with the queries and grievances of customers of the company, related to the products and services offered.

Difference between Operations Managers and General Managers:

While the roles of a General Manager and Operations Manager are similar, their responsibilities differ. A General Manager is responsible for all the aspects of the company, while an Operations Manager is responsible for the aspects of operations and production within the company. General Managers, as the name suggest, have a more general scope of power, while an Operations Manager can do whatever is possible to increase the efficiency of the production machine of the business. Thus, a General Manager is needed in all businesses without exception, while an Operations Manager has a niche in companies that offer products and services.

 (See 800 latest pictures of Obama and flood victims of Pakistan in Photo Gallery)
 Dear President Barrack Obama
The Great Leader of the World
I Agha Dilbar have sent Mr. President Barack Bobama100 registered research Letters
(1000 new ideas to develop America and to Change the World for Peace and prosperity)
Through Embassy of USA Islamabad till today and also direct sent
These registered Letters to Whitehouse Washington DC 20500.These
Letters have been written on the guidelines of CHANGE WE NEED. And
These letters are about the Common Men Problems of respected American
Peoples and their Solutions. To end, Economic Recession, Unemployment
And to Finish War, all round the World for Peace and Prosperity. In
These letters I have sent one thousand new scientific Planning
/Suggestions, about every walk of life for Peace through Friendship
Progress and Prosperity all over the World.
My dear President Barack Obama, the great leader of the world, my friend, my
Brother, provide an opportunity to Agha Dilbar to pay an official
Visit to America, that we two brothers sit together and by halt this
Horrible war. if thisf war continues for 10, 20 or 50 years it will never end.
In this war 1-million people have died from 9/11 till today, if this
War continues, it will become the 111- World War.200-Million people
Would die, if 111-World War is triggered) can take out 6.5 billion
People of the World from abyss of destruction .We two brothers Barack
Obama+ Agha Dillbar can put them on the road to Progress and
Prosperity through Peace.
Dear President Barrack Obama considers, from 9/11 till today, America
Has conducted many war operations in connection with War on Terror,
Resulting the circle of war has spread hundred times. Millions
Innocent persons have died.
In this war. Many have been rendered homeless. One Lak (10000) war
Affected youth joined the army of Al-Qaida and Talban by the help of
Anti American countries have begun gorilla war in a horrible manner.
It is the result of wrong war strategy. I Agha Dilbar desire to solve
All above mentioned problems in a meeting with President Barrack Obama
By adopting new revolutionary planning by bringing an end to present
Gorilla war in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result the World
Can enter in a peaceful, advanced and progressive World, May it be so!
I Agha Dilbar have a new War Strategy to achieve success through Table
Talk between Talban, Pakistan and American Gov. 90% of Talban that are
Fighting against Pak Army belong to Swat and Tribal Areas of NWFP. I
Can provide America all realistic facts in such manner that their
Implementation could convert these Talban into Patriotic Citizens of
Pakistan.
In this War Strategy Pakistan Gov will never send his Heavy
Artillery, Tanks, Cannons and Air craft in war. In this way 5-Million
Persons will never Displaced. In the end Talban by their will
Handover, their Weapons to Pakistan Gov, they will come to Table Talk
And Suicide Bombing will come to an end in Pakistan. Through this War
Strategy Pakistani and American Gov can save expenses on war. Through
This planning American and Pakistani Gov can utilize their saving on
War budgets for development of Schools, Hospitals, Colonies, Markets,
Industry, Roads, Bridges, Dams, Canals of Swat and Tribal Areas of
NWFP that are war affected.
Due to wrong war strategies of the American and NATO forces.
The war on terror is getting worst mainly due to use of air craft,
Tanks, Cannons.
Because nine innocent people are killed for a single terrorist this
Way in these circumstances thousands
Of innocent people lose their life or properties and any other source of income.
In the result many people join terrorist or become suicide bomber. As
They think there is no other way to take revenge of the innocents
Killing of their relatives these are the basic reasons that hundreds
Of suicides are generated very quickly and easily in Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iraq particularly who further kill thousands of other
Innocent public.
On account of present war strategy, Billion Dollars are being wasted yearly.
This war can cause fall of America instead of continuation of war; my
Best suggestion for America must keep his Supper Power on the World
And should conquer the World instead of war, but by his No-1
Scientific technology spending on agriculture, industry, trade,
Education, scientific development and tourism, all round the World.

According to second-degree black belt and business development expert, Burke Franklin, both require focus, mental discipline, self-awareness, and skill.

In his book, BUSINESS BLACK BELT: Develop the Strength, Flexibility, and Agility to Run Your Company, Franklin applies the principles from the martial arts to kick your business to the next level. It reveals concepts unlikely to appear at business schools, big companies, or among consultants, but similarly can assist you to skillfully build your business.

http://www.amazon.com/Business-Black-Belt-Strength-Flexibility/dp/160163143X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288969140&sr=1-4

BUSINESS BLACK BELT is packed full of powerful lessons you can use to develop your business instincts, including:
•	Focusing on your goal, not how you’ll get there
•	Achieving results by remaining open to the process that unfolds along the way
•	Hiring smart by asking interview questions not in anybody’s book
•	Managing creative interference – the business builder or business killer?
•	Using competitors for fun and profit
•	20 ways to succeed in business

For entrepreneurs looking for where to go when there is no one else to follow, BUSINESS BLACK BELT is an insightful resource to inspire confidence in your own right decisions.

We hope that you will consider BUSINESS BLACK BELT as an interesting and informative resource for review and would be happy to provide a sample copy.  If you are interested, please get back to us with a full mailing address and contact information.

It comes from dedicated efforts of a large number of people, who work unselfishly for the nation and improve physical and mental conditions of the masses and provide them happy living.
It is true that not all the people can contribute to the progress of the nation. It requires knowledge, wisdom, strategy and massive power to fight against prevailing odds and set the things right.  Great inner zeal and unconditional love for people are essential for working in this direction.
Although each individual who extends unconditional help to others deserves appreciation for his work but Indian civil servants, who think beyond their interest, are the most qualified people who can construct a strong foundation of happy, satisfied and contended masses for building a strong nation.
This site, www.makingyouhappy.org  is an innovative experiment (a new unexplored area, theme) done by a bureaucrat for benefiting the masses through his knowledge, experience, wisdom and resources, using latest technological advancements of IT field and CSOs( NGOs).
I would humbly request you to have a look at the site and contribute towards building a strong nation by simply promoting the site by telling about it to your friends, relatives and others.
Don’t be surprised, all the services mentioned on the site cost nothing. They are
absolutely free for all, irrespective of their cast, religion and status.

I took the Responsible Service of Alcohol Training or RSA Course because it is required as mandatory course. Since AOT created the latest, visual, highly informative and entertaining RSA course available, I enrolled online. The course is nationally recognized and delivered online in SA, WA, NT and ACT. The RSA training really helped me understand alcohol and its effects on our health and the society. Also gave me the knowledge of Australian and State liquor legislations and penalties. I am so thankful to AOT, now I am ready to apply for my dream job as a bar attendant!

12/11/2010|Form to add content|kevinrich.ila@gmail.com|http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/authenticity.htm|<http//:www.street-children.webs.com> |Help us, help street kids!|Community |Thank you for your trust in favouring the underprivileged and it is with great admiration and respect towards yourselves for your willingness and support of the needs of those who are at a disadvantage.  I pray with interest that persons with your expertise and years of experience would just take a look at a Project that has birthed in my spirit. The greatest passion for the needs of the underprivileged has driven me to this point that when I see this dream fulfilled I would honestly say; “to dust I’ll return with a smile”. Outlined is the vision and the dream - nevertheless, if you could in any event, support us to make this dream become a reality by simply sharing this project with your Executives, I’m more than convinced that South Africa will be just that tiny bit more contented.   
As an X-Street Child, I have had the privilege of having a chance in life. Now, it is my turn to give back to the community that has helped me. Over many years I dedicated myself to helping one person. A wheelchair bound Advocate who needed assistance 24/7/365, came to my rescue with her brilliant mind, and in return I loan her my spirit of helpfulness. She introduced me as a member of ILA, a Section 21, and NPO with a Section 18a.  ILA has been for many years, the unseen door for me to distribute a novel, FREE of charge. You see after some time, my frail wheelchair bound friend and associate: Anne, passed away and another advocate replaced her as Chairman of ILA. He has stepped down and I was voted in as the next Chairman. I said I would take over the responsibility if I could amend the Constitution and focus our attention on Street Children. Why you may ask? I believe if you train up a child positively while they are young, they will not depart from that training. In other words, if I can change, so can others. How does that affect the distribution of a novel? Simply imagine this; you are driving down a well known street in Cape Town, South Africa. 
You turn your favourite radio station on and it mentions something about X-Street Children in the very same Street, you cannot help notice along-side the road, banners and flags raised higher than normal. The Traffic Dept. keeping order, while SABC, ETV and World-wide TV coverage, filming a larger than normal number of X-Street Children with a bright T-shirt boldly stating; “I’m back on the Streets AGAIN, this time to GIVE!”, then they start handing out “The heart of the Caterpillar” and in return, many of them will have achieved the joy of GIVING, some for the very first time.
SUBJECT
Come Partner with us and change the perception of the worlds view, if only to add one drop of positive in the vast ocean of guilt, anger and fear. Help us, help them to make a difference to the future of our offspring. 
PHASE I:
 
To obtain a film company to film a documentary on the movement of every Phase of ILA’s portfolio’s. To be part of a CD launch (International standards naturally) whereby Kevin Rich will give a short testimony of his own background and briefly outline ILA’s portfolio, together with ten Street Children who will be wearing T/Shirts boldly stating; “I’m back on the street AGAIN - this time to GIVE!” At the launch, ILA will have an opportunity to present their portfolio to the You Magazine to be printed in several issues. 
To raise further funds, the Chairman of ILA, KEVIN RICH WILL BE LOCKED UP, WITHOUT FOOD, DAY AND NIGHT IN A SHOPPING CENTRE (The Waterfront still to be confirmed) early 2011. (Mr. Rich will be living off liquids for 40 days and nights without solid food. This has been witnessed by others and he has achieved this goal before, and with God’s strength he will attempt it again.)
 
PHASE 2:
 
The printing of twenty thousand books/novels written by Kevin Rich titled; “The heart of the Caterpillar”, this to be handed out by Street Children in Phase 3. After a short rest for Kevin Rich to recover and spend some time with his family. ILA will take plus minus 50 Street Children out of the Shelters for a week or two at a campsite where they will be taught leadership, team building and to teach skills on how to give back to the community.  
 
PHASE 3:
 
The setup of banners and flags down Buitengracht Street, Cape Town. The Traffic Dept. keeping order while SABC, ETV, CTV and our own film crew are presently filming a larger than normal number of X-Street children with a bright T-shirt that boldly states; “I’m back on the street AGAIN - this time to GIVE!”, then they start handing out “The heart of the Caterpillar” this ebook can be downloaded at <http//:www.ilafund.co.za/ebook.doc>
 
PHASE 4:
 
A follow-up team that will report the progress of the Street Children, look for potential leadership abilities (Children who are willing to change) to help assist financially, educationally and God willingly place children in a healthy environment, whereby they can one day make a difference to society. After a month or so, take the same children with the same T/Shirt on and go back to the same street to hand the DVD of all the activities through ILA. 
 
Conclusion:
 
While the Second Team does all the follow-up work in Cape Town, the First team will implement the complete package, not including the 40 day fast in Johannesburg, then Durban, Bloemfontein etc.

Though this form of government has both positive and negative aspects in its practical approach, most of the people want to enjoy this form of government. The people of Bangladesh are no exception. However, Bangladesh has been facing various problems to institutionalize democracy since its independence. Yet it, prospects of democracy in Bangladesh are not insignificant at all. It is the fact that democracy cannot be established overnight. Though democracy is supposed to ensure these principles of democracy unfortunately good governance is still a far destiny in Bangladesh. As a consequence, democracy without good governance becomes fragile and cannot run smoothly with its own spirit. It is now widely accepted that Bangladesh is facing a crisis of governance which originates in a malfunctioning of the democratic process. The qualitative deterioration of governance leads to raise lack of concern in pursuing democratic values in practice. The persistency in deteriorated governance creates negative impression in the mindset of the people of the country; they can’t extract favors from democracy rather their interests become somewhat distorted. In this way the steady failure to ensure good governance within the democracy could threaten its sustainability repeatedly in Bangladesh.||

The greatest and the most important advantage of e-commerce, is that it enables a business concern or individual to reach the global market. It caters to the demands of both the national and the international market, as your business activities are no longer restricted by geographical boundaries. With the help of electronic commerce, even small enterprises can access the global market for selling and purchasing products and services. Even time restrictions are nonexistent while conducting businesses, as e-commerce empowers one to execute business transactions 24 hours a day and even on holidays and weekends. This in turn significantly increases sales and profit.||

It is also defined as the “Conformance to requirements or fitness for use”; which means that the product or services must meet the intended objectives of the project and have a value to the donor and beneficiaries and that the beneficiaries can use the material or service as it was originally intended.||

So it is with the challenge of ethical decision making — knowing and doing the right thing. As much as we would like to believe that all we need is good intentions and intuition, living an ethical life, being a good person, requires a disciplined commitment to think and act in accordance with fundamental principles of right and wrong. The core ethical values I refer to as the “six pillars of character” — trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship — provide, I think, both objective criteria and a workable list of values that should guide all our choices. The standards of conduct, that arise out of those values constitute the ground rules of ethics.

By methodically evaluating our decisions in terms of these standards of conduct the moral dimension of our choices become clearer.  A decision to lie about a child’s address to gain admission to a better school involves ethical principles arising from the values of honesty (the false address is a lie), integrity and moral courage (doing the right thing when the costs are high), loyalty (do I owe it to my children to do whatever I have to do?), fairness (other families want to send their child to that school but they play by the rules), and civic duty (obey the law and do your share).||

In this modern world the art of Management has become a part and parcel of everyday life, be it at home, in the office or factory and in Government. In all organizations, where a group of human beings assemble for a common purpose irrespective of caste, creed, and religion, management principles come into play through the management of resources, finance and planning, priorities, policies and practice. Management is a systematic way of carrying out activities in any field of human effort. Management need to focus more on leadership skills, e.g., establishing vision and goals, communicating the vision and goals, and guiding others to accomplish them. It also assert that leadership must be more facilitative, participative and empowering in how visions and goals are established and carried out. Some people assert that this really isnt a change in the management functions, rather its re-emphasizing certain aspects of management.

They run over time and over budget and often dont deliver the business benefits promised.
 
Good project management techniques build in regular assessments of strategic viability as part of the project plan. Halting a project that is no longer strategically viable due to changing external factors is not a project failure. Allowing the project to run in these circumstances is a failure.
 
Project failures are almost entirely due to internal factors that can be controlled by the business.||

Will he gain anything by it ?

Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny ?

and spiritually starving millions ?

They are both critical, both need to be managed. But when financial planning (and goals) is mis-identified as a strategy, most of the time it is a result of a lack of clarity or in-site into what are the drivers for growth within the market.||

Their traditional role as community service providers has evolved into working shoulder to shoulder with government in not only developing and implementing national programs in diverse sectors but also monitoring and evaluating them. So much so that NGOs are emerging as resource organizations generating knowledge and information vital for national planning through large scale surveys and studies. In the process, they have amassed skills and are reckoned as a resource pool of experienced professionals as well as a grassroots level work force capable of reaching out and delivering services to neglected populations under most trying conditions. 

Whereas enhanced expectations from NGOs have contributed to their growth and diversification, the matching funds are hard to come by leading to a mad race for seeking grants for sustainability and survival.  At the same time, not all NGOs have the capacity to write proposals which are acceptable to the funding agencies. In the wake of increasing demand for grants, funding agencies have also raised their standards of evaluation. As a result, a large number of NGOs who are not so resourceful are pushed out in the first round itself. Know- how for preparing a proposal for funding which meets the rigors of scrutiny at the hands of  funding agency is therefore a crying need of all but a few privileged NGOs.||

The Animal Firm refers to Orwell’s classic book Animal Farm, in which authoritarian pigs are the boss. The Animal Firm is based on international research into High Performance Organizations HPO. The authors link the HPO success factors of excellent performance to strong animal characteristics. And what have they discovered? That ‘dumb geese’, ‘tactless elephants’ and ‘barking dogs’ perform better. It has since been proven that reorganizations, high bonuses and more checklists do not help people perform better. Their study among High Performance Organizations showed that success depends on other factors. Interestingly, many animals appear to instinctively demonstrate this behavior.

But how do you cleverly organize such animal behavior? How do you control it? It is quite simple actually. Simply go on safari and study the Big Five of animal behaviors for successful management!||

Money? Machines and buildings? People? Ideas? None of the a above! It is time… YOUR time. Management time is the asset that can only be spent once, that cannot be exchanged and that cannot be earned back. If your time is so scarce, then it is logical for you to do everything to use this asset as optimally as possible.

Focus, Focus, Focus

But in practice this is not as simple as it sounds. You are overwhelmed with advice, websites, books, advisors, conferences, good friends and colleagues about how you can best use your time to improve the organization. Slowly you are really starting not to see the forest for the trees. Where should you start? Doing nothing is not an option. After all, you are living in an age of extreme competition. An age in which organizations are having an increasingly difficult time due to the combined pressure of worldwide competition, rapid technological developments, better and better reachability all over the world, economic liberalization, more and bigger mergers and clients and citizens that are becoming increasingly demanding.||

Many organizations emerge from a crisis in a weak position because they focused too much on cost reductions. However, a review of past crises reveals that there are always organizations that seize the opportunities offered by crises. During difficult times these organizations tailor their strategy to their specific circumstances to achieve an optimum balance between what they have do and what they can do. These organizations do not automatically choose for a cost reduction strategy but consider a wide range of courses of action. As a result, they strengthen their position and, after recovery of the economy, they emerge as a frontrunner in their industry. This article reviews the possible courses of action during a recession, illustrated by companies that took these actions in practice, and explains how you can determine the course you need to take to help your organization to not only survive but thrive in a crisis.

Design/methodology/approach
On the basis of a previous meta analysis into high performance which identified five factors characteristics of a High Performance Organization (HPO), and a review of the financial strength of an organization, six courses of action are identified and illustrated with practical examples.||

The capital ratio is calculated using the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets.

This ratio is used to protect depositors and promote the stability and efficiency of financial systems around the world.||

3/15/2011|Form to provide feedback|neurosurgedw@yahoo.com|http://managementhelp.org/prod_mng/prod_mng.htm||||||Dear Sir,

 
As a neurosurgeon with a long experience both in research and operational practice, I invented a revolutionary vascular device that enables a sutureless anastomosis technique.  More specifically, I developed and invented the Screw-Device (SD)  and Anchoring Screw-Device (ASD). As the names suggest, the devices involve a method of screwing blood vessels together without the need for suturing. The patents were filed in Brussels in April 2003. 
Australia, Canada USA, Japan, China, Russia and India have already approved my patent. Very soon the EPO will follow this decision. 
 
The implementation of these new inventions will have an enormous impact on all operation techniques involving some form of anastomis. Modern vascular operation technique, including bypass surgery, still implies suturing blood vessels together. Worldwide more than 2 million bypass operations are performed every year. My newly developed techniques and devices do away with suturing and consequently have a lot of advantages over classic suturing. To name the most important advantages of my invention: 
-         it is much faster and reduces operation time;
-         it causes far less microtrauma of the vessel wall;
-         it is much easier to learn for the surgeon;
-         due to its rigid form it avoids any collapse of the vessel wall as it prevents the anastomosis site from collapsing;
This means that my devices and techniques are a lot safer for the patient.
 
The method and the tools can be used in all kinds of vascular operations, so the market for implementation is enormous.(cardio-vascular, transplant, reconstructive, neurovascular..)


 
My invention has recently attracted a lot of attention from different universities, research centres and so on. In the following months, I will attend various international conferences to discuss the implementation and development.
As your company is interested in life sciences, neuroscience new materials and techniques,
I presume you will be interested in my inventions. 
As my patented invention and the new technique are  “new to the world product” USA company can become the market leader. 
 
 The success of the invention
- Technical advantage
- Commercial advantageI look forward to hearing from you and I will welcome any invitation to present you with all the details you may need about my invention.
 
Yours faithfully,
dr. Erwin De Winter
neurosurgeon

We need a debate about how we develop rewarding working relationships today. (Rewarding not just productive).  It is the competitive core – energizing people and harnessing technologies better than anyone else.

Leader and Followers

The ultimate standard for such rewarding relationships is a leader’s ability to sustain superior results over an extended period.  The debate should focus three questions:

    * What does it mean to lead?
    * What does it mean to follow?
    * When do you choose one from another?||

Aligning Leaders for a Complex World|Business|Accelerating Complexity places extreme demands on leaders. The leader’s ability to relate, energize, and develop their followers is critical to empower them to act without direction. It’s a competitive imperative and requires a new balance of more effective and affective leadership. It’s the ability to produce results by being affective. That ability to influence people, in the way they think , feel and act is now paramount

As Peter Senge said Leaders “…cannot afford to choose between reason and intuition, or head and heart, any more than they would choose to walk on one leg…”

So, this month I deal with what leaders need to do – the easier bit. Next month, I cover the tougher piece on how leaders need to lead transformationally.||

The Animal Firm refers to Orwell’s classic book Animal Farm, in which authoritarian pigs are the boss. The Animal Firm is based on international research into High Performance Organizations HPO. The authors link the HPO success factors of excellent performance to strong animal characteristics. And what have they discovered? That ‘dumb geese’, ‘tactless elephants’ and ‘barking dogs’ perform better. It has since been proven that reorganizations, high bonuses and more checklists do not help people perform better. Their study among High Performance Organizations showed that success depends on other factors. Interestingly, many animals appear to instinctively demonstrate this behavior.

But how do you cleverly organize such animal behavior? How do you control it? It is quite simple actually. Simply go on safari and study the Big Five of animal behaviors for successful management!||

The term “job security” appears to be obsolete, as the economic crisis that began in the banking, the housing market and automotive industry has spread like a virus throughout the entire country, threatening our economic stability. Most employees today are struggling with stress and anxiety due to uncertainty. For psychologists, this is a great opportunity during this period of the unpredictable workplace to guide clients to control and lessen stress. We can take a leadership position in helping clients and people in the workplace learn and grow through this negative time of turmoil.
We need to offer our clients a process for stress reduction techniques that focus on resilience. Resilience, as you know, is fostering a mental process of positive thinking, realizing we are learning, (and) creating healthy personality characteristics after being exposed to unfavorable life circumstance causing stress.||

In BMDs newly update report, 10 Secrets to an Effective Performance Review, Paul Falcone advises that the most important part of the process should be active listening on the part of the supervisor and a basic self-evaluation form that includes three core questions:

1. “Why is our company a better place for your having worked here? How do you feel you have performed throughout the review period? Name some specific accomplishments.”
2. “Which performance areas do you wish to develop? What can management do to help you build on your strengths?” 
3. “What are your goals for the upcoming review period? Measurable outcomes?” Falcone is author of 2600 Phrases for Effective Performance Reviews and a noted expert on the topic.||

These practices are grounded in brain science, positive psychology, and contemplative training. They’re simple and easy to do – and they produce powerful results. For example, one practice asks you to take a few minutes each day to notice little things you appreciate or feel grateful for, like the smell of an orange, the smile of a friend, or a sense of your own sincerity and good intentions. This may not sound like much, but research has shown that this practice will lift your mood, protect you against stress, and even strengthen your immune system.

We are so busy these days that it’s great to have just one thing to focus on: a simple theme each week to reflect on and be inspired by. These are private practices: no one needs to know you are doing them. Meanwhile, you’ll be gradually strengthening your neural pathways of happiness, love, and wisdom.||

We have always waited for the grant award letter to be returned before actually marked the grant approved, in case a donor has an issue with something in the letter.
 
Since most people want their money, I get the letters back within a week and pay out within two to four weeks.
 
How would an auditor look at a grant that was approved on May 1 but not posted to the GL until July 1... This grant would probably have a start date of June 1.

If we don’t know how to step outside the situation, we just repeat the same behaviors, and never learn to re-define the problem.  By learning to change perspectives or simply to invite in others with a different take on things, we gain a new understanding of the situation and the ability to re-formulate.||

    NGERIV is a non profit organization located in Bwawani village, near Morogoro, Tanzania.
The current situation in most rural areas in Tanzania makes development hard to achieve. Economic hardship, lack of knowledge and other structural difficulties lead families to act inneficiently and unaware of alternatives. This reality ensures the permanence of poverty and environmental depletion.
Therefore, NGERIV aims to tackle the existing problems through collective community effort. It aims to empower individuals with the necessary capabilities to improve their livelihoods. Our area of intervention can be divided into three reciprocally inter-related areas:

    * Education;
    *Alternative means of income;
    *Environmental sustainability.||

The struggle itself is an epitome for the need for transparency not only on part of individuals but also on the part of different government entities. This struggle is redefining the Indian mindset and holds valuable nuggets of information that can be integrated as part of an individual or corporate growth.

In principle a background check is needed to validate the candidate’s integrity. Integrity in terms of being able to truthfully declare educational, professional qualifications, presenting valid residential information and essentially being responsible for the actions that lead to the candidate’s current level of qualification. Also it’s imperative that the candidate should ‘under promise and over deliver’ as any inconsistency in the promises made during the background check can have adverse effects. Drawing direct parallels is the failure of Baba Ramdevji in being able to fire the nation’s imagination towards his cause. The cause though noble was smeared by evidence of secret pacts with the reigning government and a lack of transparency in the Baba’s and his aide’s background. The opaque background left Baba Ramdevji open to government attacks and for the lack of better information most of his followers became his critics.||

There are a million explanations being offered for this rating change, ranging from less than practical US debt management policies to its ‘spend now think later’ mindset. The policies and mindset did have an implication on the economic crises that have lead to the revised S&P rating but the element that has been downplayed is the role of the thousands of employees that work at the hundreds of financial institutions across the USA.

Now I am not stating that all the employee in the US financial sector have a role to play in the countries current financial crisis nor am I saying that there is lack of an effective background checks system in places for hiring new employee. On the contrary the major credit for introducing background check policies would go to the US. However it is important to look at the issue from a workforce perspective. Based on historical evidence almost all financial crises are accompanied by a set of underlying malpractices.||

That is, quality is the degree to which a product lives up to its performance, endurance, maintainability, and other attributes that a customer expects to receive from purchasing this product. In order to produce quality product, one must instill TQM concept into ones product development process. The word "total" means the total of everything in an organization. That is, it covers every process, every job, every resource, every output, every person, every time and every place. According to the American Society for Quality Control (ASQC), total quality management (TQM) "is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. TQM is based on the participation of all members of an organization to improving processes, products, services, and the culture they work in. TQM benefits all organization members and society. The methods for implementing this approach are found in the teachings of such quality leaders as Philip B. Crosby, W. Edwards Deming, Armand V. Feigenbaum, Kaoru Ishikawa, and J.M. Juran."||

Doing an analysis of this type is a good way to better understand a business and its markets, and can also show potential investors that all options open to, or affecting a business at a given time have been thought about thoroughly. The essence of the SWOT analysis is to discover what you do well; how you could improve; whether you are making the most of the opportunities around you; and whether there are any changes in your market-such as technological developments, mergers of businesses, or unreliability of suppliers-that may require corresponding changes in your business.

In the present scenario management and distribution of water has become centralized. People depend on government system, which has resulted in disruption of community participation in water management and collapse of traditional water harvesting system.

 

As  the water crisis continues to become severe, there is a dire need of reform in water management system and revival of traditional systems. Scientific and technological studies needs to be carried out to assess present status so as to suggest suitable mitigative measures for the revival to traditional system/wisdom. Revival process should necessarily be backed by peoples initiative and active public participation.

 

Living creatures of the universe are made of five basic elements, viz., Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Sky, Obviously, water is one of the most important elements and no creature can survive without it. Despite having a great regard for water, we seem to have failed to address this sector seriously. Human being could not save and conserve water and it sources, probably because of its availability in abundance. But this irresponsible attitude resulted in deterioration of water bodies with respect to quantity and quality both. Now, situation has arrived when even a single drop of water matters. However. " better late than never", we have not realized the seriousness of this issue and initiated efforts to overcome those problems.

To protect your company against potential loss, a proactive and defined approach to the collection and monitoring of insurance certificates is essential.||

The Difference Between Tracking Insurance Certificates and Ensuring Vendor Compliance

An important part of any corporate risk management strategy is working with safe, reliable vendors and contractors. One critical step towards this goal is ensuring that those vendors carry and maintain the required insurance coverage. Merely collecting insurance certificates from vendors, however, is only a partial solution. Unless each certificate is carefully reviewed and scrutinized, the company hiring the vendor may not in fact be covered by that vendor’s insurance policy.||

In doing so, organizations have an expectation that if the vendor causes injury to a third party, the vendor’s insurance coverage will be triggered, and defend and indemnify them. This protects those businesses which rely on vendors, by ensuring that liability stays with the party responsible for the loss.||

However, more frequently, insurers will selectively eliminate the provision/s in the standard CGL coverage form to eliminate coverage for the most common instance of contract liability: One party indemnifying another party for tort liability.

Non-admitted (i.e.: surplus lines) insurers are frequently issuing Commercial General Liability (CGL) policies which contain non-standard endorsements.

Of these, the most important reason is the first. Intensive learning of persuasive techniques and their methods of operation allows the learner to explore the other two reasons of responsible persuasion and critical self-analysis on one’s own. In essence, the main objective, demonstrated by these three reasons, is to absorb information quickly, analyze it critically, note uses of persuasion, discern factual speech, incorporate personal or subconscious thought, and act in response to the information.||

INTRODUCTION:

Our Voluntary Service in Kenya Programme is run by Education Supplements International which is a registered non-governmental (NGO) based in Nakuru, Kenya. It comprises both short and long-term volunteering.

This is a volunteer  programme that aims to give opportunities to people who love and desire to live, work and contribute away from their home country environment, contribute to the progress of humanity and participate in inter-cultural richness among people of various age, gender, race, academic and economic levels.

Many volunteers have also played a significant role in poverty reduction and relief projects.

OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE:

1. Teachers

 Short and long-term teaching in baby-class,nursery,primary and secondary school levels.These schools are located in Dundori Division of Nakuru North District.There are seventeen (17) schools where we attach our volunteers (Details of these schools are available on request).

2.Medical Personnel and Interns

Opportunities available at Dundori Health Centre at Dundori Centre and the Provincial General Hospital in Nakuru town.

3.Engineers

They volunteer their technical knowledge in public and community utilities/facilities and projects like schools, womens groups, water projects, the construction of the Nakuru-Dundori road, village paths among others.

4.Hand-work

Womens groups are involved in the making of African baskets, necklaces, bangles, clothing artwork for sale to generate income and improve their economic well-being of the rural women and youth.

5.Childrens Counsellors

Our organization runs the Dundori Orphans Project in Githioro Centre where a child-feeding programme is going on. Childrens counsellors have an opportunity to talk, comfort and guide orphans who are under the care of aged grandparents without much economic and academic means to assist these children.

Please visit website www.dundoriorphans.com for details of these project.

6.HIV/AIDS Social Workers

They work among men and women who are HIV/AIDS positive in this region with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

7.Disability Helpers

There are several registered disability groups in Dundori region who welcome the presence of disability social workers for encouragement and involvement in their economic projects.

8.Community Project Consultants

Men, women and the youth in the villages of Menengai Hill, Wanyororo, Tabuga, Gakoe, Cura, Githioro, Umoja, Nyonjoro and Kiamunyeki are involved in community projects to enhance their social-economic status and reduce poverty. Community project consultants have a big opportunity to offer their knowledge and technical expertise in this sector.

9.Conservationists

The conservation and revival of Dundori Forest is a very active endeavour in Dundori Division. Tree planting by organized community groups present an opportunity for conservationists eager to preserve our earth.

10.Sports Coaches and Teachers

The youth have a very organized sports development and competition programme in both Dundori Division and Nakuru Town in soccer, athletes, basketball, netball, swimming, etc. Sports coaches have the opportunity to give their sporting talents to these young people who would otherwise be involved in anti-social activities like alcoholism, drug-addiction and crime.

11.Relief and Development

Distribution of food, clothing, mosquito nets and medicines in Dundori Division, slums and streets of Nakuru town and other needy areas, like in refugee camps in the arid areas of the  North (like Turkana and Samburu Districts) and North-Eastern Kenya(like Dadaab Refugee Camp which is currently the largest refugee camp in the world), orphanages and Kibera slum (which is Africas largest urban slum) is an ever-present opportunity to individuals and groups.

We also organize medical clinics by medical personnel from overseas in these areas.

COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORT

Transport to Nakuru town (which is the fourth largest town in Kenya and rated to be the fastest growing urban area in East and Central Africa) is easily available through public transport (called Matatu in Kenya, which are mainly Nissan/Toyota fourteen-seater vans) and is at most a thirty-minute drive from Dundori (15 kms. away).

Phones and Cyber/Internet facilities are available only a kilometre from the place of accommodation.

Visitors take a taxi from Jomo Kenyatta Airport in Nairobi and stay in a hotel or guest house for overnight, rest before taking a matatu at the Mololine Station at Cross Road in Nairobi for a journey to Nakuru which is 156 km (two-hour drive) from Nairobi.

ACCOMMODATION

We offer a host-family accommodation at "CAMP DAVID" Guest House where clean water, electricity, food and bed-rooms are available in a secure rural setting in Dundori.

The volunteer contributes US$300.00 per month (4 weeks) or US$ 10 per day per person for food, water, electricity and general accommodation.There is also a one-time payment of US$ 110 for picking the visitor from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on arrival in Kenya.

SOCIAL INTER-ACTION

We encourage our visiting volunteers to be eager to learn simple Kiswahili (which is the national language in Kenya and spoken throughout East African countries) words for greetings and social meetings like Jambo!(Hi), Habari Yako? (how are you?), wewe unaitwa nani? (what is your name?), unatoka wapi? (where do you come from?), etc.

VISA

Visas are required to visit Kenya by nationals of most countries in the world. We assist in the processing of a visa by writing a letter of invitation to the Kenyan Embassy or High Commission in the country where the volunteer comes from.

To all our future volunteers and partners,we say:

                                          KARIBU KENYA!

                                          (WELCOME TO KENYA!)

Looking forward to working with you.

It’s no longer a question of “if” businesses will engage in social learning, but “how” and “when”. Traditionally, organizations have wrestled with how to define social learning. Social learning can be classified as: “Any type of learning where a person learns vicariously through the observations of, or interactions with, others.” Social learning technology should enable this definition of social learning and what is now called the “Seven Cs”. Josh Bersin (Bersin & Associates) has often referred to four of them: conversation, connection, collaboration and content. While acknowledging these, there are three additional and important “Cs” in the business today: consumption, contribution and control.||

The bottom line is that if you’re adopting Scrum because of business value motivators like profitability, product turn rates, cost control, or to compress/reduce feature release windows then I would tell you that your heart is in the wrong place and that you really need to re-assess what the value proposition is for implementing Agile software development methodologies techniques. In my opinion, being successful at Scrum requires more of a change in personal and managerial philosophy than it does any type of technical or procedural change.||

Basically it refers to the procedure of unifying all your loans and liabilities by taking a single loan with a lower interest rate. Thus, the borrower now has to pay only one loan installment every month. Following are the steps you can take to consolidate your debts.

First of all calculate the total amount of debts that you owe. Note down all your debts and their details including interest rates, monthly installments, etc. This will help you determine the amount of money you need to pay it off.

Secondly, devise a practical budget. Note down all you necessary expenses and debt payments so that you know how much you need to pay for them. Also, make provisions for unforeseen expenses. If you have a problem in figuring out how to manage the basic necessities and debt payments within your income, speak to a financial advisor or counselor.

The third step is to get a loan which can be secured or unsecured, for consolidating your debts. Search for suitable lenders and contact them for details and quotes. Compare the quotes and decide on the best lender. Then fill in an application form for the loan. Once your loan is approved, the lender will send the funds to your bank account. While you are choosing among lenders, beware of unscrupulous firms.

Once you have the money in your bank account start repaying the debts you owe. Start with the ones which have the highest interest rate or the ones which are causing you the greatest trouble. 

After paying off your previous lenders you just have to follow the repayment plan provided by the lender of the debt consolidation loan and then you will be debt free. Be sure not to take additional loans while you are repaying the consolidation loan.

If you are unable to get a debt consolidation loan, it is not the end of the world. There are still some options open for you. Among these are balance transfer, reapplying for the consolidation loan once you have reduced the debt burden and taking a loan from a family member or friend.||

Since that time, strategic planning was reborn in the 1990s. New approaches for strategy focused on growth through mergers/acquisitions and joint ventures, generation of innovative ideas through decentralized strategic efforts within the company, emergent strategy, and the leveraging of core competencies to create strategic intent. By the start of this century the focus shifted to strategic and organizational innovation, including reconciling size with flexibility and responsiveness. New alliances mean cooperative strategies, complexity, changes in commitments of corporate social responsibility, etc. Todays strategic planning and execution requires new models of leadership, less formal structures, and more commitment to self-direction.

Unfortunately, both strategic planning and implementation’s effectiveness leaves a lot to be desired with 60% of all change initiatives failing. Sydney Finkelstein summarizes areas of most strategic planning failure: launching new ventures, promoting innovation and change, managing mergers and acquisitions and responding to new environmental pressures. So in this era of dramatic change, global alliances, and a variety of environmental pressures, the potential for failure is very real.

This blog looks at what leaders need to consider to avoid being another survey statistic.||

The bottom-line is that “doing more with less”sounds macho in closeted executive strategy sessions. The reality is that those who get the work done feel the stress of over-work and unabated insecurity is eroding trust in their leaders.

How close are we getting to the "old lie"?

    Dulce et Decorum est Pro patria mori.( Translation: "It is sweet and fitting to die for ones country."

    Wilfred Owen - Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - it is sweet and right to die for your country. In other words, it is great to work your butt off and then a get a pink slip

North Americans grow more cynical of being asked “go the extra mile” with even fewer resources. As a result, change resistance is increasingly more complex and individualistic.

This fracturing eats away at competitiveness. The leadership challenge then is to repair, build and protect the trust people have in their leaders and other functions.

In North America, over the last ten years I have conducted expectation alignment projects in very different organizations like Royal Bank of Canada, Qwest Telecommunications and Turner Construction. In every project, leaders consistently under-estimated the gaps between:

    What they expect of their people and what the people actually think is expected of them.
    What they think people expect of them and their people actually expect of their leaders

In all projects, leaders had 65%+ more expectations than their people were aware.  As you read on you will see that my findings are disturbingly endorsed on both sides of the Atlantic.||

    How do ensure we get the promised rewards of the Matrix?

First,  a definition for SHRM

    In a matrix structure, an employee reports to two managers who are jointly responsible for the employee’s performance. Typically, one works in an administrative function, such as finance, HR, information technology, sales or marketing, and the other works in a business unit related to a product, service, customer or geography.

I myself has done Masters in computer science and was doing very good before my accident. However, after my accident, I became disabled (no sensation/movement below neck) due to c4 complete spinal cord injury. 

Since then, Im staying in bed most of the time, and so started helping people in resolving their computer-related issues. The idea of this website is to bring people from various domains to come and help the people all over the world with their knowledge and utilise their free time to give some smile/peace of mind to someone around or someone who is thousands miles away from them.

I sincerely need help in Registering this organisation so that I can start sharing this and bringing more knowledgeable people from different domains to help the society in their free time and free of cost. 

I have also created a Facebook page for this, and currently I have around hundred people, who has clicked on like. The number of visitors And calls on the website is increasing day by day and the Count of the visitor is there on the website for reference.

The only issue as of now is this that we dont have money as we are doing all our services free and therefore were looking for someone who can help us in Registering the non-profit organisation.||

I thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting enough Social Media and Organic search engine traffic for Managementhelp.org

1.Your website Managementhelp.org is not ranking top in Google organic search for many competitive keyword phrases.

2. Your site Managementhelp.org has 2,830 indexed pages in Google. We can bring it to 100% by implementing on and off-page factors which will fetch better results in major search engines.

3. Your site has 390 Google back links, this can be improved further.

There are many additional improvements that could be made to your website, and if you would like to learn about them, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with a detailed analysis in the form of a WEBSITE AUDIT REPORT for FREE.

Our clients consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of the Google search rankings.  Being at the top left of Google (#1- #3 organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your companys website traffic and online reputation.

Sounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide me with your phone number and the best time to call you.

I am a woman, who was forced because of disablity, into a world where I depend on the gov. for survival. I live on $694.00 a mth. and cant afford the basic things to survive. The Gov. limits what we can get. I have stood in a Food Line and we can only get a three day emergancy supply. But the worst was when the Lady behind me, who had 4 kids, got just one box of cereal..same as myself. I want to form an Organization, that is under my choice, that can help the people like me who cant afford Toilet Paper, Detergent, Soap, etc. I tryed for 4 years to get help with my winter electric bill, only to be told they ran out of funds. I cant afford to put gas in my car to go to the Dr., nor have my oil changed in my 2002 car. I know what Depression comes with this and cant imagine what happens to those who have more than one person in their household. I have plans to raise money for this NPO and I know it wont be easy. I need help in starting and advice on the dos and donts. I go without so I can access to the Internet, only I have lived with any electricity for a month because I could not afford to pay, and Im total electric. I spent 3 1/2 yrs. trying to refinance to save my home and still got munipulated in the process. So my heart and soul needs to do something to help others.

Keeping labor costs low when the economy is bouncing back, however, can be a serious mistake. A wise restaurant mogul once said, “If you staff to serve 50 customers a day, you’ll eventually serve 50 customers a day. If you staff to serve 500 customers a day, you’ll achieve that, too.” His point was simple: If you are doing business, but your customers can’t receive the service they desire, they will go somewhere else and you will eventually drive sales down to the staffing level. If you’re staffing for 50 customers, but you have 500, at some point it’s likely that about 450 will go to a competitor. Seems like a simple idea, but is it?||

Malott, 2003; R.W. Malott, 1974; Rummler, 2004; Rummler & Brache, 1995, Skinner, B.F., 1953). This common framework identifies relevant components of the organization in context of how value-adding work is (and should be) done. Using such a framework makes work visible (Rummler, 2008; Rummler, Ramais & Rummler, 2010) which helps different performers within the organization observe work from a similar viewpoint & talk about it accurately amongst themselves. This facilitates agreement on where disconnects lie within the system, which performance areas need to be improved, and ultimately the priorities and resources that should be allocated to resolving those identified disconnects. Armed with a clear direction, work can be organized, performed & managed effectively.||

Kids bully each other in the hallways and on social media. Many of us have believed that it’s a “phase” that kids grow out of as they get older. Unfortunately, that isn’t always true and many of these “kids” take their bullying behaviors with them into the workplace as they “mature” and continue to bully others whom they see as “different” or “weaker.” Bullies are cowards and that definition does not change simply because a bully becomes old enough to vote.||

Respondents are aware of the risks from information-and technology-based disruptions. They realize that information and technology capabilities are fundamental to improve their business performance and competitive advantage. More companies are gaining competitive advantage by leveraging information technology for their benefit. But with progress also come some risks. Board members increasingly recognize they need to actively oversee such risks.

There are some situations where the board expressly needs to consider getting involved in IT oversight. These situations are where:

Information technology is an integral part of the company’s services
The company has a strategic program to capitalize on emerging technologies
The company is executing a major technology implementation project with a long installation period and significant costs
The company stores highly confidential information about customers or stakeholders
The company has international operations with separate technology systems
In such circumstances, senior managers should spend time in the boardroom discussing the company’s technology program. It is also important for board members to discuss with management about the associated technology risks and how the company protects sensitive information.

When it comes to IT governance, boards should step-up the oversight of:

Business-IT strategic alignment, which focuses on the level to which the goals and objectives contained in the business strategy are supported by the IT strategy;
IT value delivery, which focuses on the time and budget needed for quality IT resources implementation;
IT resource management, which focuses on IT investments and resources allocations in meeting the company’s needs;
IT risk management, which focuses on the protection of IT assets and customer information;
IT performance management, which focuses on monitoring IT processes and services to determine whether the IT resources have achieved the business goals set by the board of directors.
Companies are spending an increasing amount on IT. However, a large percentage of IT investments fail to deliver their intended return. The need for effective board-level IT governance in order to realize value from IT is becoming more and more obvious. Board members need to govern IT to maximize ROI on large capital investments.||

These processes are a good step and may include customized management seminars, as well as yearly profile reviews, but does that mean they are doing a good job of developing individuals?

Unless someone actually pulls you aside and tells you that you should change, you will not know until you examine yourself.  That is because bad attitudes are like bad customer service.  People will just take their business elsewhere rather than complain…. promotions and opportunities work the same way.  Nobody is going to tell you how you really come across…they will just pass you by so they don’t have to deal with you anymore.  So how can you examine your attitude?

No wonder our heads are spinning and we’re losing sleep! 

At The Sample Network, we are seeing the fall-out from this type of maximum overload lifestyle firsthand with people registered in our survey pools. We reached out to past respondents of one or more of our recent surveys to ask a new set of questions, questions that focused on their lack of participation. The overwhelming top two reasons for non-participation were “I was too busy to participate at the time” and “I don’t remember getting an email survey invitation.” These two reasons alone accounted for more than 65-percent of the more than 2,500 return responses.

The survey was conducted during the EMC World event, and includes data from more than 400 enterprises.

The majority of companies surveyed also indicate they have no systems in place to account for which corporate files reside in systems managed by third-party service providers. Companies reported they have no way to track what data is being stored in the cloud and no process to manage access to that data.

In short, the survey reveals that:

Only 9% of the companies surveyed have procedures in place to control access to data stored in the cloud;
23% of organizations are still developing their data access policies;
74% of respondents reported that they do not have a process for tracking which files have been placed on third party services;
68% either have no plans in place that they are aware of, or live without formal processes for granting and reviewing access
These survey results should be a wake-up call for all companies. CIOs should start developing and implementing strategies to ensure data security as quickly as possible.

Here are some questions that senior managers and the board of directors should be able to answer:

Do managers know who is responsible for security?
Does the head of security frequently meet the board of directors?
When was the last time top managers got involved in security-related decisions?
Would people recognize a security issue? Would they know who to call?
Is the company clear on its position relative to IT and security risks?
What percentage of staff had security trainings?
Are managers convinced that security is being appropriately addressed in the company?
Are managers aware of the latest information security issues and best practices?
What can be done to successfully implement information security governance?
Protecting the interests of the stakeholders is a fundamental responsibility of senior management. This includes understanding the IT risks and ensuring that they are adequately addressed from a governance perspective. To do so effectively you need to manage information security risks, by integrating an information security governance framework into your overall enterprise governance framework.||

If you come in late, you should not put 8:00 on your card. If you take a long lunch, you should not put 1:00 on your time card. I will not stand for this type of cheating. I simply have no choice but to institute an employee monitoring system. Beginning next Monday, video cameras will be installed at all entrances to the building, and your entry and exit times will be logged each time you use electronic key cards to enter or leave.
Anyone who is late for work or late coming back from lunch more than three times will have to answer to me. I don’t care if you had to take a nap or if you girls had to shop. This is a place of business, and we do not want to be taken advantage of by slackers who are cheaters to boot.

You thought your lover was not worth much. You never treated your lover with any respect or empathy. The opposite could also be true. Your lover did not see that you are worth of his or her thoughts and time. You are out of each others life and you now feel you can not go on without that person.

Every passing day your thoughts linger about those great moments you shared together. The first kiss, the feeling you felt in each others arms. You can hardly sleep. You get agitated at very small things. You find enemies in every one and get annoyed about everything. You get stressed and depressed. You look for help every where possible. The center can no longer hold. It seems the end of the world. This is a situation that is common to all of us who have lost our loved ones at some point in life. You are not unique. It happens to almost every living person. Even the mighty go through this. It is what you do about it that is important.

The first thing you have to do is to think about this issue critically. Is it worth getting this lover back? If the cause of the break up was the other person has she or he changed the ways that caused the break up? Leopards hardly ever change their spots, so are human beings. If the cause of the break up are still there, then what is the reason of luring the lost loved one back because history will surely repeat itself. May be you could do better by letting go and finding new love.

But should you find yourself to be the cause of the lost lover, then the first thing you should do is to change the cause of the break up. This is to avoid a repeat of what happened not long after your lover comes back.

The second thing you should do is to create a cooling off period. Human beings are unique characters. When you pursue them relentlessly they will play very hard to get. Avoid nagging this person they way you avoid a plague. Your lost love should never know that you are desperate to get them back.

Third action, get hold of help, there are ways in the traditional African system that can be used to help. You just have to get the right help. Sooner other than later your lost love will be back. But, remember it is very important to avoid the mistakes above. Otherwise your effort will be futile.

Many people who have sought out help get it. Your search has come to an end if you truly need a change in your love life. Do you really need the lost lover back? Are you sure? visit our||

8/21/2012|Form to provide feedback|craig@craigmurray.co.uk|||||||Hello,
I wanted to drop you a quick email regarding your site and ask whether you would be interested in us making an infographic for you? 
I’m sure you receive several similar guest post requests each week, so I wanted to quickly point out what I’m proposing and why this would be of value to you:
-We’ll provide you with an exclusive infographic created by us. Rather than simply sending you a text based article, we do all of the research and arrange for one of our designers to create an infographic solely for use on your site. This isn’t something that has been or will be published elsewhere.
-Some examples of infographics that we have recently designed and placed include,

--http://www.anglotopia.net/british-travel/london-2012/london-2012-the-olympics-by-the-numbers-infographic/ 

We can either make something based on your own ideas or data, or we can come up with some ideas for you. 

Hopefully you’ll agree the benefits on your part are great:
-Free, relevant unique content that your existing readers will appreciate
-100% ownership of the content we supply

All we ask from you is that you credit our client with a link within the post if you choose to accept and publish the work that we send through.
Please let me know if you have any questions- I’d be happy to provide more details or send through some initial ideas.

Thanks,
Craig

They clearly generate higher growth in revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA/EV.

Here are some key finds from Ernst & Young’s research:

Top-performing companies implemented twice as many of the key risk capabilities as those in the lowest-performing group.
Companies in the top 20% of risk maturity generated three times the level of EBITDA as those in the bottom 20%.
Financial performance is highly connected to the level of integration and coordination across risk, control, and compliance functions.
Effectively harnessing technology to support risk management is the greatest weakness or opportunity for most organizations.
Risks have various levels of impact and their origin isn’t solely a technology issue. There is also a major people component: employees’ behavior, processes and routines, change management and training may all come into play.
Increased reliance on technology presents new risk challenges and demand better risk management practices. CIOs must establish IT priorities, processes, and projects to fully align with the risk management needs of the organization.

What risk factors face the CIO of the 21st century?

technology-related litigation and intellectual property lawsuits
customer and organizational information security concerns
outsourcing and offshoring, which carry significant risks
expanding use of mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, external hard-disks, or flash drives
computer viruses and related “malware”
dependence on third parties which suppose accountability for others’ mistakes
Mergers and acquisitions
Government regulations;
International regulations.
However, risk intelligent companies understand risk taking as a means to create value: from strategic acquisitions to entering new markets.

A risk intelligent CIO has to:

identify, assess, manage, and report IT-specific risks such as security, privacy, and business continuity
help other employees identify, assess, manage, and report the risks their are coping with;
understand how each risk may affect the enterprise;
ensure that strategic risks are considered appropriately
help the board of directors to understand the enterprise’s risks
help the board of directors to understand the action plans that they need to be aware of||

Firsly, an interesting interview with Vivek Kundra answering the question What was it like to be CIO of the USA? Continuing the subject is an article from Joseph Marks from Nextgov, who asks Does the Federal CIO Shop Need bold vision or implementation?

This week, the IW 500 Conference has taken place in California and Rob Preston, VP & Editor in Chief, InformationWeek writes a great article summarizing the top challenges facing CIOs now, Firefighters See Problems, CIOs Must See Opportunities – “IT leaders rank BYOD and cloud among their biggest challenges. But the smartest CIOs look beyond the negatives.”

Another important event, this time focused on Cyber Security, was the Cyber Security Summit 2012 in Bonn. Politicians, businessmen and security experts met in the German city to discuss the Internet, a possible cyberwar, attacks on communication systems, cyber espionage, military hackers and, most importantly, how to solve the problems. Read more about it in Cyber security seeks tools in difficult battle.

And to finish the week on a lighter note, it seems that great changes are taking place in the IT Security world. An article from Bill Brenner, the managing editor of the CSO, has an important lesson to teach us: CSO Security Standard, lesson 4: CSOs aren’t the introverts you say they are.

That’s it for this week. Enjoy reading these articles, and share your thoughts with us and with others in your organization.||

The survey aimed to identify the various approaches being adopted by global businesses. Half the respondents were from companies with between 1,000 and 10,000 employees.
Here are some trends identified by the survey:

The security market has been undergoing a significant transformation over the past couple of years;
CISOs face greater pressure to make their businesses’ information security programs perform better;
The number-one challenge were external threats-as opposed to internal threats, compliance and regulations and integrating new technologies;
For more than 50% of respondents the biggest technology concern is securing mobile technology;
Security budgets are set to increase significantly – Two-thirds of respondents expected their information security spending to increase over the next two years
In these circumstances, it is obvious that the role of CISOs were affected by changes. The role has evolved from IT security administration to high-level risk management and will significantly transform in the future. The CISO is responsible for establishing and maintaining the strategy and program to ensure information assets are adequately protected. The CISO has the responsibility to develop, implement and maintain processes across the enterprise to:

Reduce IT risks;
Establish appropriate standards and controls;
Establish and implement security policies and procedures.;
Respond to incidents.
Here are some important responsibilities that the new CISOs should carry out:

Dealing with law enforcement agencies
Pursuing the sources of network attacks and information theft
Balancing security needs with the company’s strategic business plan
Identifing risk factors, and determine solutions
Develop security polices and procedures that provide adequate business protection
Plan and test responses to security breaches||

It is a matter that has clearly transcended the IT department, reached the Board level and now is being discussed by regulators and governments. However, responsibility for ensuring proper information security governance within an organization rests squarely with its Board since SEC guidelines require to sign off on breaches and remediation measures in their quarterly and annual filings.

The IT Governance Institute defines security governance as “the set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the enterprise’s resources are used responsibly.” (IT Governance Institute, Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd Edition).

Both board members and executive management play a part in effective security governance:

Boards of Directors are expected to include information security as a key part of governance, and integrate it within the general processes governing critical organizational resources
Senior Executives have the direct responsibility to consider and respond to information security issues
The Key points to exercising effective Security Governance are the same as Governance of any other key resources
Knowledge of how to create and implement an effective information security strategy and program
Understanding of current (and always evolving) security and cyber security issues and how their organization is expected to respond to them.
These are all academic points but Security Governance is a real life necessity and needs to involve the entire organization, including:

Board members know that information security is critical for the company, ensure an appropriate governance framework exists within the organization and request to be regularly updated on performance.
Executive Management (CEO,CIO,CFO etc.) create and implement the information security policies and hold to account the managers responsible.
Critical business processes and information flow are documented and optimized, including the associated risks.
All employees are accountable for information security. All security products, services and consultants comply with the policies set.
All security processes are regularly reviewed and updated.
The complexities of the current cybersecurity climate requires that in order to ensure appropriate Information Security Governance, IT Security Governance must be a main priority for the Board. The question is: are organizations prepared and do they have the cybersecurity experts to advise them at Board level?||
