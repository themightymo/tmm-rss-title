Statistics have shown that by exposing your employees, at whatever level, to team building activities, the results can be oustanding. This is because each member will primarily bond with the rest of the team, understand their role more clearly and become a part of that team.

This paper examines the statements of one of the world’s most notorious leaders, Adolf Hitler, to see what can be learned about leadership. An examination of these quotations will make it quite obvious what is wrong with the narcissistic leadership style and why Hitler was a disastrous leader. Unfortunately, many of today’s leaders are using what they refer to as the "corporate model of leadership" as a fig leaf to hide behind and practice a Hitlerian form of leadership. They try to build organizations that revolve around their own needs, surround themselves with sycophants, show no compassion for others, and continually cover up unwanted truths. They have no real interest in ensuring their organization lives on beyond their lifetime; all that matters is their own self-aggrandizement. Conversely, it is hoped that by studying Hitler’s approach to leadership, we can learn what leaders of today must do to build a successful organization.||

- for Wholesale Distributors using Microsoft Excel for their Inventory Management. 
In any wholesale distribution (and other) business, ‘Inventory’ is the byproduct of fluctuations in supply and demand, 
and the mismatch between the two. A way to think of inventory is that it is the shock absorber that allows us to have a 
(somewhat) smoother ride on a bumpy road. Each change in demand and/or supply represents a bump, and some of 
that ends in increasing the inventory, and some of it ends in decreasing the inventory. If the inventory did not exist, 
one would feel every bump in the road by way of customer complaints. By Cutwater Solutions.||
