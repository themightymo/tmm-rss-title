<h2>Requests for Proposal, Proposals and Contracts</h2>

<a name="anchor84653"></a>
<h3>Request for Proposals</h3>

<p>You might develop a request for proposal (RFP) and provide
it to many potential consultants, asking them to respond with
proposals. This section will be helpful when developing an RFP.</p>

<h3>Proposals</h3>

<p>Consultants usually respond to RFPs with a proposal that specifies
how they can meet the requirements in the RFP.</p>

<a name="anchor85338"></a>
<h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>The client selects the best proposal and ideally the client
and consultant establish a contract that specifies their responsibilities
and commitments to accomplish a successful project.</p>
