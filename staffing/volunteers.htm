<p>The Library topic is called &quot;Developing and Managing Volunteer
Programs&quot; to emphasize that, for the organization and its
volunteers to benefit the most from each other, volunteers should
be managed as part of an overall, systematic program, somewhat
similar to the systematic approach that should be used to managing
employees. Certainly there are differences between how employees
and volunteers are managed, but the differences are probably much
less than most people realize.</p>

<p>The following links are to sections in this overall topic and
the sections are organized in the order in which they might be
needed in an organization that is starting a volunteer management
program -- the order of the links themselves suggest the systematic
nature of a well designed volunteer management program. Organizations
that already have established programs can use this overall topic
by going directly to the sections that are relevant to current
priorities in their current program. The links below present a
wide variety of perspectives and materials about volunteer management
programs/systems.</p>

<h3>Considerations in Establishing or Modifying Volunteer Management
Systems</h3>

<p>Note that the extent to which an organization develops and
implements a volunteer management system depends on the nature
of the activities to be conducted by the volunteers. For example,
an organization that uses many volunteers, some of whom directly
serve people, will probably use a very comprehensive system. In
contrast, an organization that occasionally uses volunteers to
stuff envelopes, might do a brief solicitation to recruit any
volunteers that the organization can get and then do a very brief
training, afterwards leaving the volunteers alone to perform their
task. <br />

operate the volunteer management system.<br />

<h3>Staffing Analysis (Deciding Whether Volunteers Are Needed)</h3>

<p>Staffing analysis includes the activities to examine what expertise
is needed to achieve the business and/or strategic goals of the
organization. Then the types of needed expertise are further examined
in order to discern which types might be provided by paid employees
and by volunteers. <br />

planning (including succession planning)</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1409580"></a></p>

<h3>Legal and Risk Considerations</h3>

<p>There are a variety of types of legal and risk considerations
when using volunteers in an organization, eg, what insurance is
needed, what rights to volunteers have in the workplace, what
employment laws also apply to volunteers, and how can you ensure
that volunteers act ethically, etc. The reader will get a more
clear understanding of legal and risk considerations by reading
the topics in the following section about management policies
and procedures. <br />

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>Policies are general guidelines that personnel can reference
in order to make decisions and get guidance on how to act in certain
situations, eg, a policy about dress codes. Procedures are specific
step-by-step directions regarding completion of a specific task,
eg, powering up a computer. Policies help ensure that volunteers
are supervised and that they act according to a legal, ethical
and organizationally-preferred manner in the workplace. Policies
are often in regard to, eg, definition of volunteer, rights and
responsibilities, confidentiality, background checks, safety,
record keeping, conflict-of-interest, dress codes, orientation,
training, supervision, evaluations, corrective actions, etc. The
astute reader will recognize that the policies in regard to volunteers
are very similar in nature to the policies for employees. <br />

<h3>Volunteer Job/Task Descriptions</h3>

<p>You should be clear about what you expect from each of your
volunteers. Volunteers deserve to know what you expect from them,
as well. To recruit volunteers for a specific role or job, you
will need a clear job description from which to develop the advertisements
and to show to any potential candidates. Therefore, each volunteer
should have a job, or task, description. The description should
specify at least whom the volunteer reports to, any general duties
and responsibilities, and any specific tasks to perform. Job descriptions
might include additional information, eg, level of expertise and
education needed for the job, minimum requirements of expertise,
etc. <br />

<h2>OPERATING YOUR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM</h2>

<h3>Volunteer Recruitment</h3>

<p>Recruitment usually involves identifying the most likely sources
of suitable candidates for volunteer positions, how to approach
those sources, and then approaching each source. Sources might
include, eg, advertisements in the newspaper, word-of-mouth of
employees, recommendations from clients, online (or virtual) sources,
professional placement advisors (&quot;headhunters&quot;), volunteer
fairs (events in which many organizations that need volunteers
attend to recruit volunteers), etc. Candidates who are interested
in certain positions often complete an application form, including
providing a resume.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1269294"></a></p>

<h3>Screening Volunteers</h3>

<p>Each potential candidate for a volunteer position is usually
screened. The extent of screening for each position depends on
the nature of the tasks to be performed by the volunteer, eg,
whether the volunteer will be working directly with people in
a health facility, etc. Screening often involves carefully examining
each application, conducting background checks (eg, to verify
information in the resume, identify any legal problems, etc.),
and interviewing the most suitable candidates.</p>

<h3>Selecting (&quot;Hiring&quot;) Volunteers</h3>

<p>After candidates have been screened, ideally there is one candidate
that seems to be the most suitable for each unfilled volunteer
position. Each suitable candidate should be formally (or officially)
approached with an offer letter that describes the terms that
the organization is offering and the activities that the organization
wants the volunteer to conduct. The offer might include any benefits,
eg, free trainings, use of facilities for private use, etc. <br />

<p><a name="anchor1269832"></a></p>

<h3>Orienting and Training Volunteers</h3>

<p>If the nature of the volunteer's work is very basic and routine,
then a volunteer might require only a very basic and general introduction
to the organization and task they are to complete. In contrast,
if the nature of the volunteer's work is rather complex, eg, supervising
patients in a particular setting in a health facility, then the
volunteer will likely require a complex orientation to the organization
and also training about, eg, policies and procedures, how to respond
to particular situations, when to ask for help, how to use certain
facilities, etc. <br />

Basics for Supervisors and Learners</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1270094"></a></p>

<h3>Supervising Volunteers (Retaining, Feedback and Motivation,
Evaluating, Rewarding, and Firing Volunteers)</h3>

<p>Supervision includes a variety of activities, eg, establishing
goals with the volunteer, observing the volunteer's activities
to achieve the goals, providing guidance so the volunteer achieves
the goals effectively and efficiently (ie, has strong &quot;performance&quot;),
evaluates the volunteer's performance, rewards strong performance,
addresses any performance issues, and fires the volunteer, if
necessary. Some supervisors are also closely involved in staffing
analysis, development of job descriptions, recruiting, selecting,
and orienting and training, as well. The activities to establish
goals and provide guidance are usually considered to be the activities
of delegation. If the goals are specifically assigned to the volunteer,
with little or no involvement from the volunteer, and the supervisor
closely watches the volunteer (rather than generally guides them)
and provides specific directions, then those activities might
more aptly be described as work directing, rather than delegating.</p>

<h3>Volunteer and Staff Relations</h3>

<p>Sometimes employees and volunteers can perceive themselves
to be so different from each other that they spend little time
together, don't communicate between each other, and eventually
experience conflict between each other. <br />

<h3>Assessing Volunteer Management Programs</h3>

<p>To ensure that the volunteer management system remains high-quality,
including that the organization and its volunteers are benefiting
a great deal from their relationship, it's necessary to regularly
assess the quality of each activity (eg, developing job descriptions,
recruiting, training, supervising, etc.) to conclude if the activity
is being conducted effectively and efficiently. Results of this
overall evaluation should be used to adjust activities. Thus,
the cycle of the volunteer management system starts over again.
