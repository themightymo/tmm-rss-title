<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Do Successful Succession Planning</h2>
<h3>Guidelines to Successful Succession Planning</h3>
<p>(Various other phrases are used to refer to aspects of succession planning, 
  including succession management and transition management.) </p>
<p>Management is responsible to ensure that the organization continually has high-quality 
  operations and employees. One of the most important practices to meet this responsibility 
  is to conduct successful succession planning. Employees leave their jobs either 
  on a planned or unplanned basis. Unplanned termination may occur because of 
  sudden illnesses or death, or poor performance on the part of the employee. 
  Planned termination usually occurs because the employee is making a career or 
  life change. </p>
<p>Especially regarding managers in the workplace, demographic trends indicate 
  that there are not sufficient numbers of next-generation leaders to replace 
  retiring baby-boomers in organizations. Thus, succession management is an increasingly 
  important priority. Consider the following advice.</p>
<h3>Basic Principles of Successful Succession Planning</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not wait until the employee will be leaving. Start planning now. 
    </strong><br />
    Succession planning is a matter of strong practices in personnel management, 
    not a matter of sudden crisis management. Start attending to those practices 
    now. </li>
  <li><strong>Focus on policies, procedures and practices, not on personalities.</strong><br />
    Succession planning is being able to effectively and promptly re-fill a role, 
    not replacing a certain person. Be sure all key positions are defined well, 
    and then look to find the best person to fill the position. Do not look for 
    someone who is just like, or a lot different than, the previous employee.</li>
  <li> <strong>Succession planning is a responsibility of the management, not 
    just the employee. </strong><br />
    The best succession planning results from 1) a working partnership between 
    management and employees to accurately define the employee&#8217;s role and 
    current priorities, and 2) the employee ensuring that management has the information 
    and resources to refill the role.</li>
  <li><strong>Succession planning should be in accordance with up-to-date personnel 
    policies.</strong><br />
    Hiring of new employees must be in accordance with up-to-date personnel policies 
    to ensure fair, equitable and legally compliant employment practices. </li>
  <li><strong>Quality in managing succession is proportionate to the quality of 
    the new employee.</strong><br />
    The best way for management to promptly convey expectations of high quality 
    to a new employee is to convey that high-quality in how the employee was hired. 
    The more thorough and careful that management does the succession, the more 
    likely that the organization will get a new employee who successfully fills 
    the position for the long-term. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Practices in Successful Succession of Managers</h3>
<p>If the organization has already established strong practices in governance, 
  leadership and management, then succession planning often is a matter of using 
  current practices, rather than establishing many new ones. Key practices include 
  having:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A strategic plan that clearly conveys the organization&#8217;s mission 
    and current strategic priorities. Ideally, that plan also includes specific 
    action plans that specify who is going to do what and by when in order to 
    address each priority.</li>
  <li> Up-to-date and management-approved personnel policies about hiring, supervising 
    and firing personnel in a fair and equitable manner that complies with employment 
    laws.</li>
  <li> An up-to-date job description for each of the roles, and that explains 
    the general duties and responsibilities of the positions. </li>
  <li>Suitable compensation for the roles (often this is a major challenge for 
    new organizations because they often have very limited resources). </li>
  <li>An annual calendar of the role&#8217;s most important activities, for example, 
    when the person in that role evaluates personnel, does any staffing analysis, 
    updates job descriptions and participates in important committees. </li>
  <li>Regular reports from the person in the role. These reports should include 
    the trends, highlights and issues regarding the person&#8217;s activities.</li>
  <li> Evaluation of the person on an annual basis, including in reference to 
    the job description and any performance goals established for that role.</li>
  <li> Arrangements with the person when he or she goes on vacation so that others 
    have an opportunity to effectively replace the employee if only for a temporary 
    period of time. </li>
  <li>A complete list of major stakeholders &#8211; of people who have an interest 
    in, or will be influenced by, the employee&#8217;s leaving and being replaced 
    by someone else. Get a list, including contact information and also how each 
    is approached and who does that, in case that information is needed when/if 
    the employee leaves. This is true especially if the employee is a high-level 
    executive. In that case, get a complete list of other stakeholders, for example, 
    collaborators and suppliers.</li>
  <li> Fiscal policies and procedures to ensure strong oversight of finances, 
    including that financial numbers are correct and tracked accurately, and also 
    that there are sufficient funds to pay near-term expenses. </li>
  <li>At least annual discussions with key employees regarding succession planning, 
    including how to manage effectively in the employee&#8217;s absence. (Be sensitive 
    in raising this topic with the employee so that he or she is not overly concerned 
    that executives somehow want a change now). This discussion can be an opportunity 
    to hear about the employee&#8217;s career plans and desires, too. </li>
</ul>
