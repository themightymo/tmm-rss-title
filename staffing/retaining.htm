<h2><a name="10" id="10"></a>10 Ways to Encourage Your High Performer to Leave</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>A recent survey, Mercer&#8217;s 2010 Attraction and Retention Survey (as cited 
  on clomedia.com) indicates that 27% of companies are planning to expand their 
  workforce, which is up from 12% in 2009. As more and more companies begin hiring 
  in higher numbers, the fear of losing high performing talent increases for many. 
  If you have that fear, please see the below list of things that will drive your 
  high performing employees to seek other opportunities.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Fail to provide them with development opportunities</li>
  <li>Question everything they do</li>
  <li>Micro manage their work</li>
  <li>Fail to let them take ownership of their work</li>
  <li>Fail to provide challenging work</li>
  <li>Fail to address performance issues of others</li>
  <li>Fail to provide them with performance feedback</li>
  <li>Fail to consider their insight or fail to even ask</li>
  <li>Ignore their suggestions</li>
  <li>Fail to discuss their goals</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="are" id="are"></a>Are You Concerned With Employee Retention?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>How concerned are you about employee retention? If you are a HR pro, you should 
  always be concerned about the retention of your high performing employees. And 
  if you have allowed the job market of the past two years to sway your focus 
  on this, then you might expect some trouble ahead. According to a recent survey 
  conducted by Kelton Research, The Cornerstone OnDemand &#8220;Employee Attitude 
  Survey&#8221;, you may not be alone. </p>
<p>The survey reveals a look at the perceptions employees currently have about 
  their workplace. If we were to use the survey as a scorecard, then we would 
  see that many organizations are failing in some very critical retention areas. 
  Using the familiar grading scale of where a 70% get you a C, let&#8217;s take 
  a look at the areas with a failing grade.<br />
  GRADE</p>
<h3>Surveys Says About Showing Appreciation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 54% say their colleagues show them appreciation</li>
  <li>Only 30% say their managers; 16% say executives</li>
  <li>Grade F</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Feedback on Performance?</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 58% say NO </li>
  <li>71% say &#8220;they haven&#8217;t gotten any reaction from their supervisors 
    in the last six months.&#8221; </li>
  <li>F</li>
</ul>
<h3>Establish Career Goals with Employees? </h3>
<ul>
  <li>82% say during the past six months that they haven&#8217;t</li>
  <li>F</li>
</ul>
<h3>Show alignment with company goals and objectives?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>53% say they don&#8217;t have a clear understanding of how their role fits 
    within the organization</li>
  <li>F</li>
</ul>
