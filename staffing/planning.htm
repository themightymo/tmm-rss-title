<h3>First, Some General Principles About Staffing Planning</h3>
<p>The staffing plan specifies what positions, jobs and/or roles will be needed 
  by the organization, usually over the next year, along with how they will be 
  organized into the organization, including who they will report to and how they 
  will work together. </p>
<p>When developing a plan, whether it's a staffing plan or a strategic plan or 
  a business plan, the process of the planning is as important -- if not more 
  important -- than the plan (document) itself. So don't undervalue the process 
  to develop the plan. You will likely learn as lot as you develop it. </p>
<p>If yours is a new or small company and you don't have much experience in workforce 
  planning, then consider getting help from experts in human resources. You might 
  need only a few hours of consultation. </p>
<p>But before you get help, realize that you probably already know a lot that 
  could be put in the first draft of the plan. You -- or with a small team -- 
  write down what you think for the first draft of the plan, consider getting 
  input from others with credible feedback, adjust the drafted plan, start to 
  implement it -- and then change it as you go along. Don't worry about getting 
  it perfect. </p>
<p>Finally, don't go into great detail about each of the positions, jobs and/or 
  roles for now. You can go into more detail in the next step of staffing, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/job-descriptions.htm">How 
  to Design a New Job -- a New Position or Role</a>.</p>
<h3>Formal Means to Identify Staffing Needs and a Staffing Plan</h3>
<p>Personnel planning (also referred to as workforce planning or human resources 
  planning) is made much easier if the organization has been conducting some form 
  of strategic or business planning about the overall organization. Good plans 
  should result in action plans that specify who will be doing what and by when 
  in order to achieve the overall goals in the plans. </p>
<p>The nature of those actions often suggests the types of expertise (or personnel) 
  needed to do the actions in a timely manner. Those needs in personnel usually 
  result in staffing plans that specify what jobs or roles are needed and by when. 
</p>
<p>Do not be discouraged if your organization does not have a formal, written 
  strategic or business plan (although if you don't, you should aim to do written 
  plans soon) It's very likely that much of the information, that would be in 
  those plans, is already in the minds of the leaders in the organization. In 
  that case, use that information to begin to draft a staffing plan. </p>
<p>The process is usually in the following order. (The extent to which the steps 
  are done depends on how many resources the organization has for extensive, formal 
  planning. For example, large, well-established organizations would integrate 
  other activities than those listed below, such as analysis of demographic trends, 
  forecasts of retirements of current personnel, and succession planning.) The 
  following steps are to help the reader begin to think strategically about staffing 
  needs. </p>
<p>1. The<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm"> strategic 
  plan</a> specifies strategic goals and strategies or objectives to achieve each 
  goal. (Smaller organizations often do not include strategies, and focus instead 
  on objectives for each goal.)</p>
<p>2. The strategic plan produces an <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm#anchor1946072">action 
  plan</a> (or operational plan) that specifies actions or tasks must be done 
  in order to implement each strategy and/or achieve each objective. Ideally, 
  the action plan list the resources needed to address the strategy or objective. 
  These resources include, for example, funding, facilities and expertise (people).</p>
<p>3. A staffing plan is created by grouping similar types of expertise and tasks. 
  Those similarities often are grouped into various jobs or positions. This phase 
  is sometimes referred to as the job analysis. (Note that anyone who's ever worked 
  in an established organization already has some sense of various different types 
  of activities, or jobs, and how they might be grouped together -- so they probably 
  already know more than they realize about this stage of workforce planning.)</p>

  in the section <a href="#addl">Additional Perspectives on Personnel Planning</a> 
  below.</p>
<h3>Informal Means to Identify Staffing Needs </h3>
<p>Frankly, most personnel planning, especially in small- to medium-sized organizations, 
  is probably done on an informal basis. Often, managers realize the need for 
  a new organizational role when employees continue to report being short-handed 
  and mention that the certain tasks are not being done. This issue can point 
  to the need for new positions. (This issue can also point to other causes, for 
  example, inadequate supervision or training.)</p>
<p>Below, are some sample staffing plans. You'll see that there are a variety 
  of formats.</p>
