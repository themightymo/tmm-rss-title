<p>Ultimately, you're aiming to develop a job description for the new role. However, 
  rather than looking at a variety of sample job descriptions now, it's much more 
  useful to carefully think about what you want in the role, rather than what 
  others suggest in their job descriptions. </p>
<p>1. First, try think of the knowledge, skills and/or abilities (competencies) 
  that might be useful for someone to have in the job. Think about the results 
  of your previous <a href="planning.htm">staffing planning</a>. </p>
<p>2. Consider interviewing someone -- in or outside of your company -- who already 
  has some of those competencies. Share your staffing plan. Ask them to suggest 
  competencies. </p>
<p>3. Observe an employee or employees in similar jobs as they as the perform 
  a task or conduct the role. What areas of knowledge do you see the employees 
  using? What skills do you see the employees performing?</p>
<p>4. Consider administering a questionnaire to the employee or employees. On 
  the questionnaire, ask them to describe certain practices and procedures to 
  carry out the task or perform the role in the best way possible. Explain that 
  the questionnaire is to help the trainer help the employees to perform a task 
  or conduct a role better.</p>
<p>5. Ideally, get advice from customers about what knowledge and skills are useful 
  in delivering the best quality products or services to them.</p>
<p>6. A generic list of competencies may already exist for a role. For example, 
  professional associations sometimes provide generic lists. </p>
<p>(As with job descriptions, there are those who have strong cautions about the 
  use of competencies. Some experts assert that competencies should define the 
  abilities for someone to excel in a certain role, that is, meet high performance 
  standards, whereas other experts assert that competencies should define the 
  abilities to adequately perform in the role.)</p>
<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Develop Useful Job Descriptions</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>(Be sure to see all the steps in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/index.htm">Staffing</a> 
  process and where this step fits in the process)</p>
<h3>1. Draft a preliminary job description.</h3>
<p>Draft a job description which specifies the general responsibilities of the 
  new position along with some of the specific duties to be conducted by the role, 
  the title for the position, and any special skills, training or credentials 
  required.</p>
<p>Do not merely seek job descriptions from other organizations and adopt those 
  as is. Your open position is unique and job descriptions are very important 
  so you should develop your own &#8211; the process of completing the job description 
  is usually quite enlightening.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Note which job activities are essential and which are non-essential. </li>
  <li>Add whom the position reports to and whether the position is full-time or 
    part-time.</li>
  <li>Consider if the position requires any special physical skills. This may 
    be important when considering accommodations to candidates with physical disabilities 
    and effects. Various government agencies have employment laws in this regard, 
    for example, in the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act. </li>
  <li>If the position must be filled by a paid employee (see the next paragraph 
    to consider if a consultant is more appropriate), consider if the position 
    is salaried or hourly. Usually, highly skilled and/or professional roles are 
    salaried, while entry-level positions are hourly. </li>
  <li>Invite employees to review and edit the drafted job description. </li>
  <li>Consider including a six-month probationary period for the new position 
    and if you do so, be sure to update your personnel policies to describe your 
    organization's use of the probationary conditions. A probationary period allows 
    you to fire an employee during the six months if you have concerns and greatly 
    decreases the chances you will be sued for wrongful termination. </li>
</ol>
<h3>2. For nonprofits: Would a volunteer be most appropriate to fill the role?</h3>
<p>Consider filling the position with a volunteer if the job involves activities 
  that are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Fairly routine</li>
  <li> Unskilled</li>
  <li> Not necessarily time-critical (that is, must be done by a certain deadline) 
  </li>
  <li>Volunteers are also useful when there simply is no money to pay someone 
    to do the job. </li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Would a consultant (independent contractor) be most appropriate? </h3>
<p>At this point, consider if a consultant might fill the new position. For example, 
  it is common for small- to medium-sized organizations to hire accountants as 
  consultants. Generally, if the activities associated with your new role require 
  any of the following, then consider hiring a consultant:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Highly skilled personnel for a fixed and limited duration</li>
  <li> Unskilled personnel for a fixed and limited duration, but it is not likely 
    that you can find a volunteer to fill the role</li>
  <li> A unique set of resources or tools that are not commonly available and 
    would come with a professional (for example, a graphics designer)</li>
  <li>Note that the consideration whether to hire an employee or an independent 
    contractor is a very serious one. If the wrong choice is made, then you may 
    be assessed strong fees and penalties by the Internal Revenue Service in the 
    USA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Determine the approximate cost of the new role. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Estimate the salary range for the new position. Set this range by talking 
    to other organizations with similar product or services, or by scanning classified 
    sections of newspapers with ads for similar roles. You can also reference 
    various salary surveys. </li>
  <li>Finalize how much the position will cost the organization by adding &quot;fringe&quot; 
    to the salary. Fringe includes costs of benefits planned for the new role, 
    including health and dental and life insurance, and retirement benefits, along 
    with Workers Compensation and any pension plans. Note that, depending on the 
    state in which you live, you may be required to pay certain employment taxes 
    for part-time people, often if they are at or over half-time. For planning 
    purposes, fringe might be estimated at 40% of the salary.</li>
  <li>Additional costs of the position result from training, equipment, rental 
    of space, postage, copying, etc. You should develop a compensation program, 
    with policies that outline the procedure for determination of salary and benefits. 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Get feedback and authorization from the Board, in the case of corporations.</h3>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer may want to work with the Board Chair to prepare 
  for communication of the new job to the Board. Propose the new position to the 
  Board by attaching a proposal letter to the drafted job description along with 
  description of how the position will be funded and sending it to all Board members 
  for their review before the next Board meeting. At the next Board meeting, invite 
  open discussion and questions about the new role. Seek their authorization for 
  the new position. </p>
<h3>6. Finalize the job description. </h3>
<p>Update the job description with relevant feedback from others. It is important 
  that the job description be as accurate as possible because it is the basis 
  for determining compensation, conveying the role to the new employee and conducting 
  regular performance appraisals. Be sure to note the version of the job description 
  by including the date on the bottom. The job description should be reviewed 
  and updated annually, usually by the employee and supervisor during the performance 
  review cycle.</p>
