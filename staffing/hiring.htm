<h2><a name="choose" id="choose"></a>How to Choose the Best Candidate</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>At this point, there usually is one or two candidates who clearly stand out 
  as the most qualified for the job. However, it is surprising how much interviewers&#8217; 
  impressions can change once they all have an opportunity to carefully discuss 
  and consider all of the candidates. Be sure your approach to selecting the best 
  candidate is a comprehensive and consistent approach. </p>
<h3>Soon after interviews are completed, interviewers together select the best 
  candidate.</h3>
<p>Within one or at most two weeks after all interviews have been completed, convene 
  the interviewers. Consider a consistent method to select the best candidate 
  from among the interviewers. For example, mention the name of a candidate, and 
  allow 15 minutes total for all interviewers to share their impressions of that 
  candidate. Also share results of any comments from references and/or background 
  checks. Repeat the process for each candidate. After all candidates have been 
  discussed, then list the candidates again, this time having interviewers vote 
  for the best candidate from the list. </p>
<h3>If there does not seem to be suitable candidate, then consider the following:</h3>
<p>Are the job requirements too stringent or an odd mix? For example, the job 
  might require someone with strong technical skills and also someone with strong 
  clerical skills. Those two types of skills are sometimes unusual to expect to 
  mix together. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Reconfigure the job so that the nature of the required skills and training 
    are somewhat similar and so that the overall nature of the job becomes more 
    common. </li>
  <li>Hire the candidate who most closely matched the requirements of the job 
    and then plan for dedicated training to bring that person&#8217;s skills up 
    to needed levels. </li>
  <li>Re-advertise the position. </li>
  <li>Get advice from a human resources professional. At this point, your need 
    for their advice is probably quite specific, so they might provide services 
    on a pro bono basis. </li>
  <li>Hire a consultant for the position on a short-term basis, but only as a 
    last resort as this may be quite expensive. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="hire" id="hire"></a>How to Hire the New Employee</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>You send a strong message to the candidate in the way that you provide the 
  job offer to them. It is best to be both business-like and personal in your 
  approach. </p>
<h3>1. Provide a written job offer to the most qualified candidate.</h3>
<p>The letter should come from the person who will be supervising the new employee. 
  In the letter:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Convey that you are pleased to offer the job to the candidate.</li>
  <li> Specify the exact amount of compensation offered to him/her.</li>
  <li> Specify the benefits offered to him/her.</li>
  <li> Specify the date on which to start the job.</li>
  <li> Include a signature line that the candidate can sign.</li>
  <li> Ask him/her to sign a copy of the offer letter and return it to you by 
    a certain date. Give them at least one week to consider the job offer. </li>
  <li>Mention if there is a probationary period and the length of the period.</li>
  <li> Mention who he/she can contact if there are any questions. </li>
  <li>Attach a copy of the job description to be sure that the offer is associated 
    with the correct job. </li>
</ol>
<h3>2. If everyone declines the job offer, then consider the following:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ask the best candidates why they declined the offer. Usually, you will hear 
    the same concerns, for example, the pay is too low, the benefits incomplete, 
    the organization seems confused about what it wants from the role, or the 
    interview process seemed hostile or contentious.</li>
  <li> Reconvene the interviewers and consider what you heard from the candidates. 
    Recognize what went wrong and correct the problem. Contact your favorite candidate, 
    admit the mistake and what you did to correct it, and why you would like to 
    make an offer to him/her again. </li>
  <li>Go to the second choice. Sometimes the process of re-examining the candidates 
    can bring a second-choice candidate to the front. </li>
  <li>Re-advertise the position.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Otherwise, start a personnel file for the new employee.</h3>
<p>The personnel file with contain all of the job-related information and material, 
  for example, the employee&#8217;s resume, job description, job offer, signed 
  offer letter, completed tax withholding forms, signed forms for benefits, etc.</p>
<h3>4. Do not forget to send letters to the candidates who did not get the job.</h3>
<p>They deserve a sincere letter from you that thanks them for their consideration 
  and for interviewing for the job. Clearly explain that another candidate most 
  closely matched the qualifications specified in the job description. If you 
  plan to retain their job applications, then mention that to them so they are 
  aware that they still might be considered for other jobs that arise in the organization.
