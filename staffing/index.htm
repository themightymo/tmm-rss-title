<h2>First, a Description and Some Definitions About Staffing</h2>
<p>Before reviewing the many guidelines throughout this Library topic and its 
  various subtopics, it might be useful to understand the most common terms used 
  in staffing and, thus, included in many of the subtopics. The terms might become 
  more clear as you progress through the guidelines in this overall topic of staffing 
  in the Library. For now, try get a basic sense of what each means. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Staffing</strong> includes a broad scope of activities -- the activities 
    are best depicted by glancing at the links listed below. </li>
  <li>The word <strong>hiring</strong> is sometimes used interchangeably with 
    staffing, which does an injustice to the broad scope of activities involved 
    in staffing. Hiring might be thought more specifically as screening the best 
    job candidates, but especially making a formal job offer to the best candidate.</li>
  <li>Even before a new employee is hired to do a job, the job should be clearly 
    designed or defined. A <strong>job</strong> is a collection of tasks and responsibilities 
    that an employee is responsible to conduct. Jobs have titles. </li>
  <li>Job are usually designed by conducting a <strong>job analysis</strong>, 
    which includes examining the tasks and sequences of tasks necessary to perform 
    the job. </li>
  <li>A <strong>task</strong> is a typically defined as a unit of work, that is, 
    a set of activities needed to produce some result, e.g., vacuuming a carpet, 
    writing a memo, sorting the mail, etc. Complex positions in the organization 
    may include a large number of tasks, which are sometimes referred to as <strong>functions</strong>. 
  </li>
  <li>Note that a <strong>role</strong> is the set of responsibilities or expected 
    results associated with a job. A job usually includes several roles.</li>
  <li>The job analysis also looks at the areas of knowledge, skills and abilities 
    (the <strong>competencies</strong>) needed by the job. Typically, competencies 
    are general descriptions of the abilities needed to perform a role in the 
    organization. Ideally, competencies are even described in terms such that 
    they can be measured.</li>
  <li><strong>Job descriptions</strong> are often used to describe a job and include 
    lists of the general tasks, functions and/or responsibilities of a position, 
    whereas competencies list the abilities needed to conduct those tasks, functions 
    and/or responsibilities. Typically, the descriptions also specify to whom 
    the position reports, qualifications needed by the person in the job and salary 
    range for the position. </li>
  <li>Staffing is sometimes considered to be a subset of the activities in <strong>Human 
    Resource Management</strong>. To further confuse things, many people refer 
    to <strong>Talent Management</strong> as the activities of Human Resource 
    Management. Each of these phrases has its own topic in the Library and the 
    introductory sections of each topic explain the use of that particular term.</li>
