</p>

<p>Here is a sample of a case study report.
Evaluation included focus on the
program's process, outcomes and facilitation. The following case
study was used to convey the funder, a holistic depiction of the
experience and outcomes from the program. &quot;Jack&quot; is
a fictional name in this sample.
</p>

<p><b>&quot;Jack&quot;</b><br />
Jack is a chief executive of an organization with a small budget
and staff. Jack's overall goal in his circle was to communicate
with other executives about projects and challenges they face,
including brainstorming solutions together. He mentioned numerous
challenges that he faced in running his organization, some of
which needed specific, technical information to address.</p>

<p>In the first meeting, he mentioned
other issues that he wanted to address. In comparison to other
members in his circle, he had the most issues. He also wanted
help managing his time more effectively and he wanted to improve
the effectiveness of his board. He stated, &quot;They don't even
know what we're about. They just sit there when we meet.&quot;
And he wanted to improve his understanding of his role as a chief
executive. He asked, &quot;How do I know what I can ask the board
to do?&quot; &quot;What is my role with them?&quot; In another
area, he said he wanted some ideas about how to expand his organization's
revenue.
</p>

<p>In the first meeting, members asked
him many questions, mostly to obtain additional information about
his issues. Jack responded that his most pressing project was
time management. Another member responded, &quot;I'd challenge
you on that,&quot; and asked Jack if he would have more time if
he got more support from his board. Jack laughed and answered,
&quot;I suppose so.&quot; Other group members concurred. From
his first meeting, he took away actions including listing and
ranking his issues, scheduling a time management course, and identifying
a course that would provide an overview of the chief executive's
role. One member asked him to also list and rank his issues for
the next meeting.
</p>

<p>In the second meeting, Jack produced
the following list: improving his understanding of the chief executive
and board roles, developing/energizing the board, and conducting
strategic planning with the board that would include expanding
the revenue in his organization. Other group members agreed with
Jack's list.
</p>

<p>In discussion in the second meeting,
Jack acknowledged that he was doing more as an chief executive
than is usually expected from that role. He also realized that
he was overloaded because he got little or no support from his
board. He indicated that he did not feel confident, though, approaching
his board members for more support. As a result of other circle
members' support and coaching, he resolved to approach the board
-- and a month later, he had. He and the board members committed
to complete board training. He arranged training to include strong
focus on strategic planning, which included expanding revenue.
To further build rapport, he elected to have lunch with one board
member a month, including giving them a tour of the organization.
</p>

<p>Jack noted on his evaluation questionnaire:
&quot;[The process had!!] just the right amount of structure. The
conversation is pretty free-flowing, but there's enough attention
paid to time so that everyone gets a fair chance.&quot; His top
reported outcomes were in the categories of access to a network,
professional development, and effectiveness. &quot;[The program
provided me!!] an opportunity to meet other chief executives and
hear about projects that they faced and how they handled those
projects.&quot; He stated, &quot;The program has restored some
order to my job,&quot; and &quot;A lot has happened with my job.&quot;</p>
