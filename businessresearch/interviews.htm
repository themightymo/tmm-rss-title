<h2>Introduction</h2>

Interviews are particularly useful for getting the
story behind a participant's experiences. The interviewer can
pursue in-depth information around a topic. Interviews may be
useful as follow-up to certain respondents to questionnaires,
e.g., to further investigate their responses. Usually open-ended
questions are asked during interviews.</p>

<p>Before you start to design your interview questions and process,
clearly articulate to yourself what problem or need is to be addressed
using the information to be gathered by the interviews. This helps
you keep clear focus on the intent of each question.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor667314"></a>
<h2>Preparation for Interview</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Choose a setting with little distraction.</b>
Avoid loud lights or noises, ensure the interviewee is
comfortable (you might ask them if they are), etc. Often, they
may feel more comfortable at their own places of work or homes.</li>
<li><b>Explain the purpose of the interview.</b></li>
<li><b>Address terms of confidentiality.</b> Note any terms
of confidentiality. (Be careful here. Rarely can you absolutely
promise anything. Courts may get access to information, in certain
circumstances.) Explain who will get access to their answers and
how their answers will be analyzed. If their comments are to be
used as quotes, get their written permission to do so. <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm#anchor958083">See
getting informed consent.</a></li>
<li><b>Explain the format of the interview.</b>
Explain the type of interview you are conducting
and its nature. If you want them to ask questions, specify if
they're to do so as they have them or wait until the end of the
interview.</li>
<li><b>Indicate how long the interview usually takes.</b></li>
<li><b>Tell them how to get in touch with you later if they
want to.</b></li>
<li><b>Ask them if they have any questions</b> before you
both get started with the interview.</li>
<li><b>Don't count on your memory to recall their answers.</b> 
Ask for permission to record the interview or bring along someone
to take notes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="anchor566521"></a>
<h2>Types of Interviews</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Informal, conversational interview</b> - no predetermined questions are 
    asked, in order to remain as open and adaptable as possible to the interviewee's 
    nature and priorities; during the interview, the interviewer &quot;goes with 
    the flow&quot;. </li>
  <li><b>General interview guide approach -</b> the guide approach is intended 
    to ensure that the same general areas of information are collected from each 
    interviewee; this provides more focus than the conversational approach, but 
    still allows a degree of freedom and adaptability in getting information from 
    the interviewee.</li>
  <li><b>Standardized, open-ended interview -</b> here, the same open-ended questions 
    are asked to all interviewees (an open-ended question is where respondents 
    are free to choose how to answer the question, i.e., they don't select &quot;yes&quot; 
    or &quot;no&quot; or provide a numeric rating, etc.); this approach facilitates 
    faster interviews that can be more easily analyzed and compared.</li>
  <li><b>Closed, fixed-response interview -</b> where all interviewees are asked 
    the same questions and asked to choose answers from among the same set of 
    alternatives. This format is useful for those not practiced in interviewing.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="anchor567684"></a>
<h2>Types of Topics in Questions</h2>
Patton notes six kinds of questions. One can ask questions
about:<br />
<ol>
<li><b>Behaviors -</b>
about what a person has done or is doing</li>
<li><b>Opinions/values -</b>
about what a person thinks about a topic</li>
<li><b>Feelings -</b>
note that respondents sometimes respond
with &quot;I think ...&quot; so be careful to note that you're
looking for feelings</li>
<li><b>Knowledge -</b>
to get facts about a topic</li>
<li><b>Sensory -</b>
about what people have seen, touched, heard, tasted or smelled</li>
<li><b>Background/demographics -</b>
standard background questions, such as age, education, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the above questions can be asked in terms of past,
present or future.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor615874"></a>
<h2>Sequence of Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Get the respondents involved in the interview as soon
as possible.</b></li>
<li><b>Before asking about controversial matters (such as feelings
and conclusions), first ask about some facts.</b> With this
approach, respondents can more easily engage in the interview
before warming up to more personal matters.</li>
<li><b>Intersperse fact-based questions throughout the interview</b>
to avoid long lists of fact-based questions, which tends to leave
respondents disengaged.</li>
<li><b>Ask questions about the present before questions about
the past or future.</b> It's usually easier for them to talk
about the present and then work into the past or future.</li>
<li><b>The last questions might be to allow respondents to provide
any other information they prefer to add and their impressions
of the interview.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="anchor642707"></a>
<h2>Wording of Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Wording should be open-ended.</b>
Respondents should
be able to choose their own terms when answering questions.</li>
<li><b>Questions should be as neutral as possible.</b> 
Avoid wording that might influence answers, e.g., evocative, judgmental
wording. </li>
<li><b>Questions should be asked one at a time.</b> </li>
<li><b>Questions should be worded clearly.</b> This includes
knowing any terms particular to the program or the respondents'
culture.</li>
<li><b>Be careful asking &quot;why&quot; questions.</b> This
type of question infers a cause-effect relationship that may not
truly exist. These questions may also cause respondents to feel
defensive, e.g., that they have to justify their response, which
may inhibit their responses to this and future questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="anchor743425"></a>
<h2>Conducting Interview</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Occasionally verify the tape recorder (if
used) is working.</b></li>
<li><b>Ask one question at a time.</b></li>
<li><b>Attempt to remain as neutral as possible.</b> That
is, don't show strong emotional reactions to their responses.
Patton suggests to act as if &quot;you've heard it all before.&quot;</li>
<li><b>Encourage responses</b> with occasional nods of the
head, &quot;uh huh&quot;s, etc.</li>
<li><b>Be careful about the appearance when note taking.</b> That
is, if you jump to take a note, it may appear as if you're surprised
or very pleased about an answer, which may influence answers to
future questions.</li>
<li><b>Provide transition between major topics</b>, e.g.,
&quot;we've been talking about (some topic) and now I'd like to
move on to (another topic).&quot;</li>
<li><b>Don't lose control of the interview.</b> This can
occur when respondents stray to another topic, take so long to
answer a question that times begins to run out, or even begin
asking questions to the interviewer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="anchor784269"></a>
<h2>Immediately After Interview</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Verify if the tape recorder, if used, worked throughout
the interview.</b></li>
<li><b>Make any notes on your written notes,</b>
e.g., to clarify any scratchings, ensure pages are numbered, fill
out any notes that don't make senses, etc.</li>
<li><b>Write down any observations made during the interview.</b>
For example, where did the interview occur and when, was the respondent
particularly nervous at any time? Were there any surprises during
the interview? Did the tape recorder break?</li>
</ol>
</p>
