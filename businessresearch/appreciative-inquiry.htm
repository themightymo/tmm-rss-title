<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is Appreciative Inquiry?</h2>

<p>Appreciative inquiry (AI) is a major breakthrough in organization
development, training and development and in &quot;problem solving,&quot;
in general. AI is based on the assertion that &quot;problems&quot;
are often the result of our own perspectives and perceptions of
phenomena, eg, if we look at a certain priority as a &quot;problem,&quot;
then we tend to constrain our ability to effectively address the
priority and to continue to develop in our lives and work.</p>

<p>AI is a philosophy so a variety of models, tools and techniques
can be derived from that philosophy. For example, one AI-based
approach to strategic planning includes identification of our
best times during the best situations in the past in an organization,
wishing and thinking about what worked best then, visioning what
we want in the future, and building from what worked best in order
to work toward our vision. The approach has revolutionized many
practices, including strategic planning and organization development.</p>
