<h2>Four Levels
of Research Results</h2>

There are four levels of information that can be gathered
from customers or clients, including getting their:<br />
1. reactions and feelings (feelings are often poor indicators
that your service made lasting impact)<br />
2. learning (enhanced attitudes, perceptions or knowledge)<br />
3. changes in skills (applied the learning to enhance behaviors)<br />
4. effectiveness (improved performance because of enhanced behaviors)</p>

<p>Usually, the farther your research results get down the list,
the more useful is your research results. Unfortunately, it is
quite difficult to reliably get information about effectiveness.
Still, information about learning and skills is quite useful.</p>
