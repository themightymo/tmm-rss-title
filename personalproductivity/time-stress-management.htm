<p>One of the most frequent concerns and complaints of people today is that they 
  don't have enough time to do what they -- or especially their bosses -- want 
  them to do. Consequently, there are many resources with guidelines and tips 
  to manage time more effectively. Time management and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/time-stress-management.htm">stress 
  management</a> often are closely related and discussed together. </p>

<h2><a name="myths" id="myths"></a>Myths About Stress and Time Management</h2>
<p>Myth #1: All stress is bad. No, there's good and bad stress. Good stress is 
  excitement, thrills, etc. The goal is to recognize personal signs of bad stress 
  and deal with them.</p>
<p>Myth #2: Planning my time just takes more time. Actually, research shows the 
  opposite.</p>
<p>Myth #3: I get more done in more time when I wisely use caffeine, sugar, alcohol 
  or nicotine. Wrong! Research shows that the body always has to &quot;come down&quot; 
  and when it does, you can't always be very effective then after the boost.</p>
<p>Myth #4: A time management problem means that there's not enough time to get 
  done what needs to get done. No, a time management problem is not using your 
  time to your fullest advantage, to get done what you want done.</p>
<p>Myth #5: The busier I am, the better I'm using my time. Look out! You may only 
  be doing what's urgent, and not what's important.</p>
<p>Myth #6: I feel very harried, busy, so I must have a time management problem. 
  Not necessarily. You should verify that you have a time management problem. 
  This requires knowing what you really want to get done and if it is getting 
  done or not.</p>
<p>Myth #7: I feel OK, so I must not be stressed. In reality, many adults don't 
  even know when they're really stressed out until their bodies tell them so. 
  They miss the early warning signs from their body, for example, headaches, still 
  backs, twitches, etc.</p>
<h2><a name="causes" id="causes"></a>Major Causes of Workplace Stress</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Not knowing what you want or if you're getting it - poor planning.</li>
  <li>The feeling that there's too much to do. One can have this feeling even 
    if there's hardly anything to do at all.</li>
  <li>Not enjoying your job. This can be caused by lots of things, for example, 
    not knowing what you want, not eating well, etc. However, most people always 
    blame their jobs.</li>
  <li>Conflicting demands on the job.</li>
  <li>Insufficient resources to do the job.6. Not feeling appreciated.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="biggest" id="biggest"></a>Biggest Time Wasters</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Interruptions. There will always be interruptions. It's how they're handled 
    that wastes time.</li>
  <li> Hopelessness. People &quot;give in&quot;, &quot;numb out&quot; and &quot;march 
    through the day&quot;.</li>
  <li> Poor delegation skills. This involves not sharing work with others.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="common" id="common"></a>Common Symptoms of Poor Stress and Time Management</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Irritability. Fellow workers notice this first.</li>
  <li> Fatigue. How many adults even notice this?</li>
  <li> Difficulty concentrating. You often don't need to just to get through the 
    day!</li>
  <li> Forgetfulness. You can't remember what you did all day, what you ate yesterday.</li>
  <li> Loss of sleep. This affects everything else!</li>
  <li> Physical disorders, for example, headaches, rashes, tics, cramps, etc.</li>
  <li> At worst, withdrawal and depression.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="wise" id="wise"></a>Wise Principles of Good Stress and Time Management</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Learn your signs for being overstressed or having a time management problem. 
    Ask your friends about you. Perhaps they can tell you what they see from you 
    when you're overstressed.</li>
  <li> Most people feel that they are stressed and/or have a time management problem. 
    Verify that you really have a problem. What do you see, hear or feel that 
    leads you to conclude that you have a time or stress problem?</li>
  <li> Don't have the illusion that doing more will make you happier. Is it quantity 
    of time that you want, or quality?</li>
  <li> Stress and time management problems have many causes and usually require 
    more than one technique to fix. You don't need a lot of techniques, usually 
    more than one, but not a lot.</li>
  <li> One of the major benefits of doing time planning is feeling that you're 
    in control.</li>
  <li> Focus on results, not on busyness.</li>
  <li> It's the trying that counts - at least as much as doing the perfect technique.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="simple" id="simple"></a>Simple Techniques to Manage Stress</h2>
<p>There are lots of things people can do to cut down on stress. Most people probably 
  even know what they could do. It's not the lack of knowing what to do in order 
  to cut down stress; it is doing what you know you have to do. The following 
  techniques are geared to help you do what you know you have to do.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Talk to someone. You don't have to fix the problem, just report it.</li>
  <li> Notice if any of the muscles in your body are tense. Just noticing that 
    will often relax the muscle.</li>
  <li> Ask your boss if you're doing OK. This simple question can make a lot of 
    difference and verify wrong impressions.</li>
  <li> Delegate.</li>
  <li> If you take on a technique to manage stress, tell someone else. They can 
    help you be accountable to them and yourself.</li>
  <li> Cut down on caffeine and sweets. Take a walk instead. Tell someone that 
    you're going to do that.</li>
  <li> Use basic techniques of planning, problem solving and decision making.</li>
  <li>Concise guidelines are included in this guidebook. Tell someone that you're 
    going to use these techniques.</li>
  <li> Monitor the number of hours that you work in a week. Tell your boss, family 
    and/or friends how many hours that you are working.</li>
  <li> Write weekly status reports. Include what you've accomplished last week 
    and plan to do next week. Include any current issues or recommendations that 
    you must report to your boss. Give the written status report to your boss 
    on a weekly basis.</li>
  <li>&quot;Wash the dishes&quot;. Do something you can feel good about.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="techs" id="techs"></a>Simple Techniques to Manage Time</h2>
<p>There never seems to be enough time in the roles of management and supervision. 
  Therefore, the goal of time management should not be to find more time. The 
  goal is set a reasonable amount of time to spend on these roles and then use 
  that time wisely.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Start with the simple techniques of stress management above.</li>
  <li> Managing time takes practice. Practice asking yourself this question throughout 
    the day: &quot;Is this what I want or need to be doing right now?&quot; If 
    yes, then keep doing it.</li>
  <li> Find some way to realistically and practically analyze your time. Logging 
    your time for a week in 15-minute intervals is not that hard and does not 
    take up that much time. Do it for a week and review your results.</li>
  <li> Do a &quot;todo&quot; list for your day. Do it at the end of the previous 
    day. Mark items as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in priority. Set aside 
    two hours right away each day to do the important &quot;A&quot; items and 
    then do the &quot;B&quot; items in the afternoon. Let your answering machine 
    take your calls during your &quot;A&quot; time.</li>
  <li> At the end of your day, spend five minutes cleaning up your space. Use 
    this time, too, to organize your space, including your desktop. That'll give 
    you a clean start for the next day.</li>
  <li> Learn the difference between &quot;Where can I help?&quot; and &quot;Where 
    am I really needed?&quot; Experienced leaders learn that the last question 
    is much more important than the former.</li>
  <li> Learn the difference between &quot;Do I need to do this now?&quot; and 
    &quot;Do I need to do this at all?&quot; Experienced leaders learn how to 
    quickly answer this question when faced with a new task.</li>
  <li> Delegate. Delegation shows up as a frequent suggestion in this guide because 
    it is one of the most important skills for a leader to have. Effective delegation 
    will free up a great deal of time for you.</li>
  <li> If you are CEO in a corporation, then ask your Board for help. They are 
    responsible to supervise you, as a CEO. Although the Board should not be micro-managing 
    you, that is, involved in the day-to-day activities of the corporation, they 
    still might have some ideas to help you with your time management. Remember, 
    too, that good time management comes from good planning, and the Board is 
    responsible to oversee development of major plans. Thus, the Board may be 
    able to help you by doing a better themselves in their responsibilities as 
    planners for the organization.</li>
  <li> Use a &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign! During the early part of the day, 
    when you're attending to your important items (your &quot;A&quot; list), hang 
    this sign on the doorknob outside your door.</li>
  <li> Sort your mail into categories including &quot;read now&quot;, &quot;handle 
    now&quot; and &quot;read later&quot;. You'll quickly get a knack for sorting 
    through your mail. You'll also notice that much of what you think you need 
    to read later wasn't really all that important anyway.</li>
  <li> Read your mail at the same time each day. That way, you'll likely get to 
    your mail on a regular basis and won't become distracted into any certain 
    piece of mail that ends up taking too much of your time.</li>
  <li> Have a place for everything and put everything in its place. That way, 
    you'll know where to find it when you need it. Another important outcome is 
    that your people will see that you are somewhat organized, rather than out 
    of control.</li>
  <li> Best suggestion for saving time - schedule 10 minutes to do nothing. That 
    time can be used to just sit and clear your mind. You'll end up thinking more 
    clearly, resulting in more time in your day. The best outcome of this practice 
    is that it reminds you that you're not a slave to a clock - and that if you 
    take 10 minutes out of your day, you and your organization won't fall apart.</li>
  <li> Learn good meeting management skills. Meetings can become a terrible waste 
    of time. Guidelines for good meeting management are included later in this 
    section.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="role" id="role"></a>Role of &quot;Gumption&quot;</h2>
<p>Everything good usually starts with gumption. It's picking yourself up, deciding 
  that you could be happier, that you want to be happier - and then doing one 
  small thing to get you started and keep you going. Boredom and blaming are the 
  opposite of gumption. Stress and time management start with gumption. It's the 
  trying that counts. Poor time and stress management often comes from doing the 
  same thing harder, rather than smarter.</p>
