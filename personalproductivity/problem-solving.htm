<h2><a name="guide" id="guide"></a>Guidelines to Problem Solving and Decision 
  Making</h2>
<p> Much of what people do is solve problems and make decisions. Often, they are 
  &quot;under the gun&quot;, stressed and very short for time. Consequently, when 
  they encounter a new problem or decision they must make, they react with a decision 
  that seemed to work before. It's easy with this approach to get stuck in a circle 
  of solving the same problem over and over again. Therefore, it's often useful 
  to get used to an organized approach to problem solving and decision making. 
  Not all problems can be solved and decisions made by the following, rather rational 
  approach. However, the following basic guidelines will get you started. Don't 
  be intimidated by the length of the list of guidelines. After you've practiced 
  them a few times, they'll become second nature to you -- enough that you can 
  deepen and enrich them to suit your own needs and nature.</p>
<p>(Note that it might be more your nature to view a &quot;problem&quot; as an 
  &quot;opportunity&quot;. Therefore, you might substitute &quot;problem&quot; 
  for &quot;opportunity&quot; in the following guidelines.)</p>
<h3>1. Define the problem</h3>
<p>This is often where people struggle. They react to what they think the problem 
  is. Instead, seek to understand more about why you think there's a problem. 
</p>
<h4>Define the problem: (with input from yourself and others). Ask yourself and 
  others, the following questions:</h4>
<ol>
  <li> What can you see that causes you to think there's a problem?</li>
  <li> Where is it happening?</li>
  <li> How is it happening?</li>
  <li> When is it happening?</li>
  <li> With whom is it happening? (HINT: Don't jump to &quot;Who is causing the 
    problem?&quot; When we're stressed, blaming is often one of our first reactions. 
    To be an effective manager, you need to address issues more than people.)</li>
  <li> Why is it happening?</li>
  <li> Write down a five-sentence description of the problem in terms of &quot;The 
    following should be happening, but isn't ...&quot; or &quot;The following 
    is happening and should be: ...&quot; As much as possible, be specific in 
    your description, including what is happening, where, how, with whom and why. 
    (It may be helpful at this point to use a variety of research methods. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Defining complex problems:</h4>
<p>If the problem still seems overwhelming, break it down by repeating steps 1-7 
  until you have descriptions of several related problems.</p>
<h4>Verifying your understanding of the problems:</h4>
<p>It helps a great deal to verify your problem analysis for conferring with a 
  peer or someone else.</p>
<h4>Prioritize the problems:</h4>
<p> If you discover that you are looking at several related problems, then prioritize 
  which ones you should address first.</p>
<p> Note the difference between &quot;important&quot; and &quot;urgent&quot; problems. 
  Often, what we consider to be important problems to consider are really just 
  urgent problems. Important problems deserve more attention. For example, if 
  you're continually answering &quot;urgent&quot; phone calls, then you've probably 
  got a more &quot;important&quot; problem and that's to design a system that 
  screens and prioritizes your phone calls.</p>
<h4>Understand your role in the problem:</h4>
<p>Your role in the problem can greatly influence how you perceive the role of 
  others. For example, if you're very stressed out, it'll probably look like others 
  are, too, or, you may resort too quickly to blaming and reprimanding others. 
  Or, you are feel very guilty about your role in the problem, you may ignore 
  the accountabilities of others.</p>
<h3>2. Look at potential causes for the problem</h3>
<ul>
  <li> It's amazing how much you don't know about what you don't know. Therefore, 
    in this phase, it's critical to get input from other people who notice the 
    problem and who are effected by it.</li>
  <li> It's often useful to collect input from other individuals one at a time 
    (at least at first). Otherwise, people tend to be inhibited about offering 
    their impressions of the real causes of problems.</li>
  <li> Write down what your opinions and what you've heard from others.</li>
  <li> Regarding what you think might be performance problems associated with 
    an employee, it's often useful to seek advice from a peer or your supervisor 
    in order to verify your impression of the problem.</li>
  <li> Write down a description of the cause of the problem and in terms of what 
    is happening, where, when, how, with whom and why.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Identify alternatives for approaches to resolve the problem</h3>
<p>At this point, it's useful to keep others involved (unless you're facing a 
  personal and/or employee performance problem). Brainstorm for solutions to the 
  problem. Very simply put, brainstorming is collecting as many ideas as possible, 
  then screening them to find the best idea. It's critical when collecting the 
  ideas to not pass any judgment on the ideas -- just write them down as you hear 
  them. (A wonderful set of skills used to identify the underlying cause of issues 
  is Systems Thinking.)</p>
<h3>4. Select an approach to resolve the problem</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When selecting the best approach, consider:</li>
  <li> Which approach is the most likely to solve the problem for the long term?</li>
  <li> Which approach is the most realistic to accomplish for now? Do you have 
    the resources? Are they affordable? Do you have enough time to implement the 
    approach?</li>
  <li> What is the extent of risk associated with each alternative?</li>
</ul>
<p>(The nature of this step, in particular, in the problem solving process is 
  why problem solving and decision making are highly integrated.)</p>
<h3>5. Plan the implementation of the best alternative (this is your action plan)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Carefully consider &quot;What will the situation look like when the problem 
    is solved?&quot;</li>
  <li> What steps should be taken to implement the best alternative to solving 
    the problem? What systems or processes should be changed in your organization, 
    for example, a new policy or procedure? Don't resort to solutions where someone 
    is &quot;just going to try harder&quot;.</li>
  <li> How will you know if the steps are being followed or not? (these are your 
    indicators of the success of your plan)</li>
  <li> What resources will you need in terms of people, money and facilities?</li>
  <li> How much time will you need to implement the solution? Write a schedule 
    that includes the start and stop times, and when you expect to see certain 
    indicators of success.</li>
  <li> Who will primarily be responsible for ensuring implementation of the plan?</li>
  <li> Write down the answers to the above questions and consider this as your 
    action plan.</li>
  <li> Communicate the plan to those who will involved in implementing it and, 
    at least, to your immediate supervisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>(An important aspect of this step in the problem-solving process is continually 
  observation and feedback.)</p>
<h3>6. Monitor implementation of the plan</h3>
<p>Monitor the indicators of success:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Are you seeing what you would expect from the indicators?</li>
  <li> Will the plan be done according to schedule?</li>
  <li> If the plan is not being followed as expected, then consider: Was the plan 
    realistic? Are there sufficient resources to accomplish the plan on schedule? 
    Should more priority be placed on various aspects of the plan? Should the 
    plan be changed?</li>
</ol>
<h3>7. Verify if the problem has been resolved or not</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to verify if a problem has been solved or not is to resume 
  normal operations in the organization. Still, you should consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li> What changes should be made to avoid this type of problem in the future? 
    Consider changes to policies and procedures, training, etc.</li>
  <li> Lastly, consider &quot;What did you learn from this problem solving?&quot; 
    Consider new knowledge, understanding and/or skills.</li>
  <li> Consider writing a brief memo that highlights the success of the problem 
    solving effort, and what you learned as a result. Share it with your supervisor, 
    peers and subordinates.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="rational" id="rational"></a>Rational Versus Organic Approach to Problem 
  Solving</h2>
<h3>Rational</h3>
<p>A person with this preference often prefers using a comprehensive and logical 
  approach similar to the guidelines in the above section. For example, the rational 
  approach, described below, is often used when addressing large, complex matters 
  in strategic planning.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define the problem.</li>
  <li> Examine all potential causes for the problem.</li>
  <li> Identify all alternatives to resolve the problem.</li>
  <li> Carefully select an alternative.</li>
  <li> Develop an orderly implementation plan to implement that best alternative.</li>
  <li> Carefully monitor implementation of the plan.</li>
  <li> Verify if the problem has been resolved or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>A major advantage of this approach is that it gives a strong sense of order 
  in an otherwise chaotic situation and provides a common frame of reference from 
  which people can communicate in the situation. A major disadvantage of this 
  approach is that it can take a long time to finish. Some people might argue, 
  too, that the world is much too chaotic for the rational approach to be useful. 
</p>
<h3>Organic</h3>
<p>Some people assert that the dynamics of organizations and people are not nearly 
  so mechanistic as to be improved by solving one problem after another. Often, 
  the quality of an organization or life comes from how one handles being &#8220;on 
  the road&#8221; itself, rather than the &#8220;arriving at the destination.&#8221; 
  The quality comes from the ongoing process of trying, rather than from having 
  fixed a lot of problems. For many people it is an approach to organizational 
  consulting. The following quote is often used when explaining the organic (or 
  holistic) approach to problem solving. </p>
<p><em>&#8220;All the greatest and most important problems in life are fundamentally 
  insoluble &#8230; They can never be solved, but only outgrown. This &#8220;outgrowing&#8221; 
  proves on further investigation to require a new level of consciousness. Some 
  higher or wider interest appeared on the horizon and through this broadening 
  of outlook, the insoluble lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its 
  own terms, but faded when confronted with a new and stronger life urge.&#8221; 
  </em><br />
  From Jung, Carl, Psychological Types (Pantheon Books, 1923)</p>
<p>A major advantage of the organic approach is that it is highly adaptable to 
  understanding and explaining the chaotic changes that occur in projects and 
  everyday life. It also suits the nature of people who shun linear and mechanistic 
  approaches to projects. The major disadvantage is that the approach often provides 
  no clear frame of reference around which people can communicate, feel comfortable 
  and measure progress toward solutions to problems. </p>
