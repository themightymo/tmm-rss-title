<p>The chief executive officer is the most important role in the
management of an organization. This topic in the library does
not go into great detail about each of the particular systems
and practices managed by the chief executive officer because those
systems and practices are explained in depth across many of the
other topics in this library. This library topic provides sufficient
overview for the reader to gain basic perspective on the typical
roles and responsibilities of the chief executive officer and
how those responsibilities are typically met.</p>

<p>This syndrome occurs when the organization operates according
to the personality of someone in the organization (usually the
founder) rather than according to the mission of the organization.
The Chief Executive Officer can make a big difference in helping
an organization to detect Founder's Syndrome and recover from
the Syndrome.<br />

<h2>What is the &quot;Chief Executive Officer&quot;?</h2>

<h3>A &quot;Definition&quot;</h3>

<p>The definition of &quot;chief executive officer&quot; (almost
always) depends on whether a business is a corporation or not,
that is, whether it (usually) has a board of directors or not.
In an organization that has a board of directors, the &quot;chief
executive officer&quot; is (usually) the singular organizational
position that is primarily responsible to carry out the strategic
plans and policies as established by the board of directors. In
this case, the chief executive reports to the board of directors.
In a form of business that is usually without a board of directors
(sole proprietorship, partnership, etc.), the &quot;chief executive
officer&quot; is (usually) the singular organizational position
(other than partnerships, etc.) that sets the direction and oversees
the operations of an organization.</p>

<p>The chief executive officer is the overall, primary management
and leadership role in the organization. Therefore, it's critical
that chief executive officers have strong knowledge and skills
in a wide variety of areas. However, there are certain basic areas
of knowledge and skills which provide the foundation from which
chief executive officers can add knowledge and skills customized
to the particular nature of their organization, its industry (service,
manufacturing, wholesale, etc.) and the current environment (political,
social, economic and technological).</p>
