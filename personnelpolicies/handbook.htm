<h2><a name="books" id="books"></a>Purpose of Employee Handbooks</h2>
<p>Document all intended employment policies and procedures and collect them in 
  a policies and procedures manual. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personnelpolicies/policies.htm">Personnel 
  Policies</a>.) Having all policies and procedures in a manual facilitates training 
  about them to all employees. All employees should have read the manual to understand 
  and accept its contents. They should sign a form indicating so, and provide 
  the signed form to the organization's administrator. </p>
<p>All supervisors should be trained about the policies and procedures. A large 
  number of suits brought against organizations is because, although the organizations 
  had clear policies, supervisors did not enact the policies because they did 
  not understand them. Note that courts may consider policies and procedures as 
  superseded by the actual behaviors displayed by supervisors. </p>
<p>The Board of Directors (in the case of corporations) should authorize all policies 
  in the manual and every employee should receive a copy of the manual. </p>
<p>Each policy should include wording to the effect that the policies are for 
  general guidance in the relationships between staff and the agency, the board 
  has authorized the policy, that policies can be changed at any time and that 
  the policies do not constitute a contract between the organization and the employee. 
  Consider the following wording on the cover of your policies manual: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Nothing contained in or implied by this manual creates or shall be 
    deemed to create or constitute a contractual obligation to employees on the 
    part (of the organization). The policies, procedures and guidelines contained 
    in this manual are subject to change at any time, do not confer any obligation 
    (on the part of the organization) and do not create any right to employment 
    on the part (of the organization).&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="update" id="update"></a>The Employee Handbook- Is There an Update 
  Needed?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.sherimazurek.com/" target="_blank">Sheri Mazurek</a></p>
<p>So what do you say when an employee asks, &#8220;What&#8217;s the policy regarding 
  [insert any random employee concern here]? If the answer starts with, &#8220;Well, 
  the handbook says [&#8230;], but we usually we just do it this way. Then you 
  may be in trouble. Or, have you ever given the answer that you believed to be 
  correct just to have the employee state, &#8220;well, the handbook says I am 
  entitled to [&#8230;].&#8221; And as soon as it is out of their mouth, you say, 
  &#8220;well, that is not how we do things.&#8221; Or, instead of saying a word, 
  you pull out the handbook and frantically search to find the source of their 
  comment certain that you are going to prove them wrong. If any of the above 
  scenarios sound familiar to you, your handbook or your handbook compliance may 
  need a tune-up.</p>
<p>Having an accurate, up to date handbook has many advantages in the workplace. 
  It provides employees and supervisors with guidance on how to handle situations 
  as they arise. However, compliance with the policies contained within consistently 
  across the organization can be even more important to mitigate risk to the organization. 
  And while mitigation of risk shouldn&#8217;t be the only priority of HR professionals, 
  it is a necessary part of the job. And even if you are not concerned with risk 
  mitigation, just having the consistent compliance with policies provides a better 
  workplace for employees. They like knowing what is expected and what consequences 
  will occur for not meeting those expectations.</p>
<p>Below is a list of things to consider when creating, updating and communicating 
  your employee handbook or Standard Operating Procedures. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Have it reviewed by an attorney.</li>
  <li>Review it at regular intervals to ensure policies are current and up to 
    date.</li>
  <li>Have a plan in place to address updates to policies. How will the updates 
    be communicated to the organization?</li>
  <li>Ensure the communication of all policies to everyone in the organization.</li>
  <li>Provide training to supervisors and company leaders on the importance of 
    consistently following all policies.</li>
  <li>Keep a log of all updates and changes to all policies.Don&#8217;t lock yourself 
    into consequences you don&#8217;t want to enforce. Doing so, will encourage 
    non-compliance and get you into trouble.</li>
</ul>
