<h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About Personnel Policies</h2>
<h3>Role of Personnel Policies</h3>
<p>There are numerous laws and regulations which regulate the nature of the relationship 
  between an employee (and volunteer, in the case of nonprofits) and his or her 
  organization. They are intended primarily to ensure that everyone is treated 
  fairly and equitably regardless of their race, creed, color or sexual orientation. 
  They are intended to ensure that the treatment of employees and volunteers is 
  based primarily on their job performance. Common types of activities guided 
  by the laws and regulations are, for example, hiring and firing, benefits and 
  compensation, affirmative action, rights of privacy, discrimination and harassment, 
  and wrongful termination. </p>
<p>One of the fastest growing types of lawsuits brought by employees against their 
  organizations is wrongful termination of employment. Other common types of lawsuits 
  are in regard to allegations of discrimination and harassment. It is far better 
  for organizations first to ensure that these types of improper types of behaviors 
  do not occur, than to have to defend themselves in courts of law. The best way 
  to ensure occurrence of proper behaviors is to enact comprehensive guidelines 
  regarding how employees and volunteers are treated in the workplace. These general 
  guidelines are called personnel policies. Specific sequences of activities resulting 
  from the guidelines are often called procedures. </p>
<p>Note the difference between operational policies and personnel policies. Operational 
  policies are to guide how employees conduct the activities of the organization, 
  ranging from how a client joins a program to making sure the coffee maker is 
  unplugged at the end of the day. Operational policies are not about the nature 
  of the relationship between the employee or volunteer and the organization.</p>
<h3>Developing Personnel Policies</h3>
<p>Each organization should carefully consider what policies it requires and how 
  they should be worded. When developing policies, always consult an expert who 
  is very knowledgeable about federal, state/provincial and local laws regarding 
  employment practices. For example, in the USA, consider the Civil Rights Act 
  of 1964, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992, and Occupational Safety and 
  Health Acts. In Canada, some major employment laws are Employment Insurance 
  Act, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security Act, Canada Labour Code, etc. Personnel 
  policies might also be governed by union rules or other contractual agreements. 
</p>
<p>Many organizations develop their policies first by closely reviewing policies 
  of organizations with similar programs and services. While that practice is 
  a good start, you still should have an authority on employment practices review 
  your policies. Finally, in the case of corporations, the Board should formally 
  approve the policies and the approval should be documented in Board meeting 
  minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="train" id="train"></a>Training on Policies</h2>
<p>If employees&#8217; or volunteers&#8217; (in the case of nonprofits) behaviors 
  do not conform to the written personnel policies for your organization, and 
  if an employee or volunteer sues your organization, then courts will consider 
  your written policies to be superseded (or replaced) by your employees&#8217; 
  or volunteers&#8217; actual behaviors that you appeared to be permitting to 
  occur.</p>
<p>For example, if policies specified that employees should not discriminate on 
  the basis of race, creed or color, yet there was a history of your employees 
  clearly discriminating against other employees on that basis, then courts will 
  conclude that your policies are to permit discrimination. Therefore, it is critical 
  that employees and volunteers have clear understanding of each personnel policy 
  and that their behaviors conform to those policies. The best way to accomplish 
  that understanding if for employees and volunteers to be trained on the policies 
  and for their supervisors to always be sure that policies are followed. Training 
  about policies can be carried out by ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> All employees and volunteers receive an orientation that includes overview 
    of the policies and procedures. </li>
  <li>All employees and volunteers sign a document that indicates that they have 
    reviewed the policies and will act in accordance with them. </li>
  <li>Supervisors regularly issue reminders to employees and volunteers about 
    key policies.</li>
  <li> All supervisors themselves act in accordance with the policies.</li>
  <li> Any violation of terms of the policies is immediately addressed with reprimand 
    or termination of the employee or volunteer, depending on the nature of the 
    violation. </li>
</ul>
