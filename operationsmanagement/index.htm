<h1>Operations Management</h1>

<!--[index|Operations Management]-->
<p>Assembled by <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>

<p>Operations management focuses on carefully managing the processes
to produce and distribute products and services. Major, overall
activities often include product creation, development, production
and distribution. (These activities are also associated with <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/index.htm" class="textlink">Product
and Service Management.</a>) Related activities include managing
purchases, inventory control, quality control, storage, logistics
and evaluations of processes. A great deal of focus is on efficiency
and effectiveness of processes. Therefore, operations management
often includes substantial measurement and analysis of internal
processes. Ultimately, the nature of how operations management
is carried out in an organization depends very much on the nature
of the products or services in the organization, for example,
on retail, manufacturing or wholesale.</p>

<h2>Product and Service Management</h2>

<p>As noted above, the major activities involved in product and
service management are similar to those in operations management.
However, operations management is focused on the operations of
the entire organization, rather than managing a product or service.

<h2>Quality Management</h2>

<p>Quality management is crucial to effective operations management,
particularly continuous improvement. More recent advancements
in quality, such as benchmarking and Total Quality Management,
have resulted in advancements to operations management as well.
