<h2>&quot;Should I Really Start a New Business?&quot;</h2>

<p>If you're the type of person that conventional wisdom calls
the &quot;entrepreneur&quot;, then you might be very eager to
&quot;roll up your sleeves and just get started&quot;. However,
conventional wisdom also suggests that most new businesses fail
within the first five years. If you truly want to start a business
that will succeed for the long term, then there really is some
preliminary thinking that you really should do. If you have not
read the following document, then do so now. The following will
help you think about:<br />
- Whether you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur<br />
- What alternatives exist to starting a new business<br />
- If your finances are ready for starting a new business<br />
- Whether there is really a need for your new service/product<br />
- What type of business are you starting?<br />
- What skills and resources do you need?</p>

<p>You <i>don't</i> have to decide these matters in detail at
this time. But you should be aware of them and &quot;plant them
in your head&quot; to think on as you have time. <br />

<h2>Laws and Regulations Regarding Your Business</h2>

<p>The laws and regulations that your business must follow depend
very much on what state you live, the legal form of your business
and the nature of your product or service. Consequently, there
is no comprehensive, up-to-date checklist of laws and regulations
that you can &quot;walk through&quot;. However, the following
links will give you a good sense of what laws and regulations
to find out more about. To identify the laws and regulations your
business will have to follow, contact your state's Attorney General's
office.</p>
