<h2>STARTING YOUR NONPROFIT</h2>

<p><a name="anchor123456"></a></p>

<h3>Should You Really Start a New Nonprofit?</h3>

<p>There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the benefits
of starting a nonprofit. Particularly in times of a poor or rough
economy, people think they can start a nonprofit to quickly generate
income. Or, when people see a strong, unmet need in the community,
they often focus only on the singular solution to start a new
nonprofit. The following article gives a very useful description
of the realities of starting yet another new nonprofit. <br />
<a href="http://dongriesmannsnonprofitblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/2010-new-years-resolution-no-new.html" target="_blank">New
Year's Resolution -- No New Nonprofits Unless ...</a><br />

a Nonprofit</a><br />

<p>Also see the article:<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-forprofit-or-nonprofit.pdf">Should
I Start a For-Profit or a Nonprofit?</a></p>

<p>Before starting a nonprofit business, there is some preliminary
&quot;business&quot; thinking that you really should do. Doing
this thinking now can save you -- and maybe your employees and
clients -- a great deal of anguish.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm">Entrepreneurs
-- Are You Really Ready to Start a New Organization?</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1465078"></a></p>

<h3>What Do You Mean by &quot;Starting a Nonprofit&quot;?</h3>

<h4>Get Clear About the Purpose (the Mission) for Your New Organization</h4>

<p>Perhaps the best way to really clarify to yourself what you
intend to accomplish by starting a new nonprofit is to write a
basic mission statement for your organization. You'll soon need
this mission statement anyway if you plan to incorporate your
nonprofit (more about incorporation a little later on). The following
guidelines may be helpful to you when writing your first, basic
mission statement.</p>

<p>1. At is most basic, the mission statement describes the overall
purpose of the organization. It addresses the question &quot;Why
does the organization exist?&quot;</p>

<p>2. The statement can be in a wide variety of formats and lengths,
ranging from a few sentences to a few pages. At this stage in
the development of your nonprofit, it might be best to keep your
mission statement to at most about half a page.</p>

<p>3. When writing the mission statement, try include description
of what you think will be the new nonprofit's <br />
a) primary benefits and services to clients<br />
b) groups of clients who will benefit from those services<br />
c) values that will guide how your nonprofit will operate<br />
d) how you'd like others to view your nonprofit</p>

<p>4. It's often useful to refine the first, basic mission statement
by adding or deleting a sentence or a word from the mission statement
until you feel the remaining wording accurately describes the
purpose of the new nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>(You may want to read more about <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm#anchor323314">Developing/Updating
Mission Statements</a>.)</p>

<h4>Now Think About What Kind of Nonprofit You Want to Start</h4>

<p>The phrase &quot;starting a nonprofit&quot; can mean several
things. Read the following very basic information to begin thinking
about what you mean when you set out to &quot;start a nonprofit&quot;.
Keep your mission statement in mind when thinking about each of
the following. (There will be more specific guidance later on
when you read the next subsection <a class="textlink" href="#anchor4293394539">Variety
of Checklists to Reference When Formalizing Your New Nonprofit</a>.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can be a nonprofit organization just by getting together
  with some friends, eg, to form a self-help group. In this case,
  you&#146;re an informal nonprofit organization.</li>
  <li>You can incorporate your nonprofit so it exists as a separate
  legal organization in order to a) own its own property and its
  own bank account; b) ensure that the nonprofit can continue on
  its own (even after you&#146;re gone); and c) protect yourself
  personally from liability from operations of the nonprofit. You
  incorporate your nonprofit by filing articles of incorporation
  (or other charter documents) with the appropriate local state
  office. (An incorporated nonprofit requires a board of directors.)
  In Canada, you can file for incorporation at the provincial or
  Federal levels.</li>
  <li>If you want your nonprofit (and if you think your nonprofit
  deserves) to be exempt from federal taxes (and maybe some other
  taxes, too), you should file with the IRS to be a &quot;tax-exempt&quot;
  organization. (The IRS states that you must be a corporation,
  community chest, fund, or foundation to receive tax-exempt status.
  Articles of association may also be used in place of incorporation.)
  (Probably the most well known type of nonprofit is a the IRS
  classification of 501(c)(3), a &#147;charitable nonprofit&#146;.)
  (Being tax-exempt is not the same as being tax-deductible.) In
  Canada, you can file for tax-exemption at the provincial and
  Federal levels.</li>
  <li>Depending on the nature of your organization, you may also
  granted tax-deductible status from the IRS. Publication 526 lists
  the types of organizations to which donations are deductible.
  In Canada, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) grants
  charitable status, and you must be incorporated to achieve charitable
  status.</li>
  <li>So, for example, you could start a nonprofit that is incorporated,
  tax-exempt and eligible to receive tax deductible donations.</li>
  <li>The particular steps you take when starting your nonprofit
  depend on your plans for your organization, including the nature
  of its services. They also depend on how the IRS interprets the
  nature of your organization, including its services. Again, in
  Canada, you can file for incorporation and tax-exempt status
  at the provincial or Federal levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consider Fiscal Sponsorship to Jump Start Your Organization</h3>

<p>In some cases, you might find and work with another nonprofit
organization that will act as your fiscal sponsor. A fiscal sponsor
might be useful to you if your nonprofit:<br />
1) Does not have sufficient resources to handle startup costs
and fees<br />
2) Does not have sufficient skills initially to manage your finances<br />
3) Will address a community need and then no longer need to exist.

Sponsorship -- Help You Get Started?</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor677527"></a></p>

<h3>Do You Need a Lawyer to Start Your Nonprofit?</h3>

<h4>You Can Do Much of the Work Yourself -- But Get Legal Advice
and Guidance</h4>

<p>You can do much of the work yourself to get incorporated and/or
tax-exemption and/or tax-deductibility, but you should have some
basic guidance and advice from a lawyer who understands nonprofit
matters. For example, in the USA, it's very important how you
characterize your plans when filing for incorporation with your
state and/or for tax-exemption and/or tax-deductibility with the
IRS -- otherwise, your new organization may be deemed a for-profit
or you may have to pay federal taxes (among other taxes) on your
income. In addition, there are various reports and filings you
may have to submit. A nonprofit-knowledgeable lawyer can help
you a great deal. Ask other nonprofits for references to good
lawyers. Ask a local funder. Call the local bar association.The
following link might also help you. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/working-with-lawyers.htm">Getting
and Using a Lawyer</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor797218"></a></p>

<h3>Nonprofit Incubators</h3>

<p>Business incubators are usually facilities that help businesses
share resources as low-cost means to getting started. You may
have a nonprofit incubator in your community. Contact the local
office of the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.ncna.org/" target="_blank">National
Council of Nonprofit Associations</a> to find out. The following
links will give you an overview of business incubators. <br />

<h3>Something to Avoid: Founder's Syndrome</h3>

<p>Founder's Syndrome occurs when an organization operates according
to the personality of someone in the organization (usually the
founder) more than it operates according to the mission of the
organization. The Syndrome is not uncommon. To learn how to &quot;diagnose&quot;
and recover from the syndrome, including to just stay away from
it in the first place, read:<br />
