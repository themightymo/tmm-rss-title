<h2>How to Use This &quot;Manual&quot;</h2>

<p>Far too often, people are so eager to start a new organization,
product, service or program that they end up skipping some very
important considerations. This is very likely one of the major
reasons that so many new organizations fail within the first five
years. This manual will help you ensure that you're really ready
to start your new venture.</p>

<p>The first section of this manual is &quot;Considerations About
You&quot;. Carefully answer each of the questions in this section.
The second section is &quot;Considerations to Address About Your
Idea for a New Organization&quot;. In this section, you don't
need to answer the questions in detail -- but you should be aware
of how you plan to answer the questions once you've started your
new venture.</p>

<p>Near the end of the manual, you're referred to other sites
that can help you officially register your new organization once
you've considered the questions -- and resources to help you answer
them -- in this manual.</p>

<h2>Are You Really an Entrepreneur?</h2>

<h3>What is an Entrepreneur?</h3>

<p>It often takes a certain kind of person to be an entrepreneur.
The following articles might help to give you some sense of the
typical nature of an entrepreneur, that is, someone who starts
a new venture (organization, program, product line, etc.). <br />

<p>Another approach to understanding the nature of entrepreneurs
is to interview entrepreneurs in your community. The links <a

<h3>Are You an Entrepreneur? (articles to help you reflect about
this question)</h3>

<p>The following article &quot;Are You An Entrepreneur?&quot;
helps you to get started thinking about your own nature as an
entrepreneur. The article references the notion of starting a
home business, but applies even if you're planning start another
kind of organization. If you're planning to start a nonprofit,
then you might substitute the focus on money in the following
article for a focus on community service -- otherwise, the article
is still relevant to your situation. <br />

<h2>Have You Considered Alternatives to Starting an Organization,
Product or Service?</h2>

<p>Sometimes people try start their own organization (for-profit
or nonprofit) because they're frustrated with their lives or current
jobs. These are valid reasons. But starting an organization can
cause even more frustration! There are alternatives that should
be considered before you start a new organization.</p>

<p>NOTE: In the next section, titled &quot;Resources to Help You
Explore Alternatives Other Than Starting an Organization or Product&quot;,
there are resources that can help you answer each of the following
questions.)</p>

<p>1. <b>How about working to improve your attitude toward your
life or work?</b> 
<br />The frustrations of starting a new organization might make
your attitude even worse for you -- and those around you.</p>

<p>2. <b>How about working to get promoted in your current job?</b>
<br />
This option lets you work from current strengths to shore up areas
where you might need growth, and you can usually keep your current
benefits and level of income, as well.</p>

<p>3. <b>How about finding a new job?</b> 
<br />This can be much easier than starting a new organization.
You might even consider getting a part-time job to phase yourself
into the full-time role of running your new organization. Sometimes
just the activity of interviewing with other companies can remind
you of your value, and improve your attitude in your current job.</p>

<p>4. <b>(For those of you who are thinking about starting a new
for-profit organization) How about buying an existing organization?</b>

<br />An existing organization already has products/services, customers
and a financial track record.</p>

<h2>Are Your Personal Finances in Shape?</h2>

<p>It's likely that your personal income will be affected if you
start a new organization, particularly if you have to invest any
of your personal finances in your new organization. You should
consider where your money will come from while you're getting
your new organization off the ground. Where will you get benefits,
such as health insurance, auto insurance, life insurance, etc?</p>

<p>You should take stock of your finances. Potential funders may
want to understand your personal financial situation -- and will
be impressed if you've done thorough planning and documentation.</p>

<h2>How Will You Manage the Stresses Involved?</h2>

<p>Most people assume that there are many stresses involved in
getting a new venture off the ground. Few people really prepare
for them. They're too eager to get the new organization going.
You very likely won't be able successfully to manage the new organization
for the long term if you can't successfully manage yourself as
well.</p>

<h3>What Are Your Stress Levels Now?</h3>

<p>Take the following tests to discern how stressed you might
be now.<br />

<h3>Basics for New Managers and Supervisors to Manage Themselves</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/stresses.htm">Basics
for New Managers and Supervisors to Manage Themselves</a><br />
At this point, you need not have detailed answers to the following
questions. But you should be thinking about how you will get answers
to them.</p>


<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor1793499"></a>

<h2>Is There Really a Need for the Product or Service in Your
Organization?</h2>

<p>Whether you're starting a new product, service or organization,
there needs to be a strong market for it -- whether it's for a
nonprofit or for-profit. If you're starting a new organization,
then you are also thinking about the new product or service that
the new organization will be providing. Sometimes people get so
excited about their idea for a new product or service, that they
almost become obsessed with the idea of starting their own new
organization -- without really verifying if there really is a
market for their new product or service in the first place!</p>

<p>Some basic planning can go a long way toward verifying if there's
a market for a product or service, and whether you're really committed
to starting it. If you don't have the commitment to do some basic
planning, then you might be fooling yourself about whether you
have the commitment to start and run an organization. Do some
up-front, basic planning! The following basic questions address
many of the critical considerations when starting a new organization.
Next to each question is a recommended topic from the Free Management
Library.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you'll need funding to start your new for-profit or
nonprofit organization, investors or funders are much more likely
to provide money to you if they see that you've done some planning.</p>

<p>NOTE: In each topic are links to related topics as well.</p>

<p>1. <b>What is the nature of your new product or service?</b>
<br />
Is it retail? Manufacturing? Service? Wholesaling? The answer
to this question will guide you to a wide variety of helpful resources
by contacting trade associations for retail, manufacturing, services
or wholesaling. If your product is primarily a service to the
community, then you may want to consider starting a nonprofit
organization. The topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/types.htm"
class="textlink">Two Basic Types of Business Organizations: For-Profit
and Nonprofit</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-forprofit-or-nonprofit.pdf"
class="textlink">Should I Start a Nonprofit or For-Profit</a>?
will help you answer this question. (Nonprofit entrepreneurs may
also benefit from the topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/socialenterprise/index.htm"
class="textlink">Social Entrepreneurship</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/index.htm"
class="textlink">The Unique Needs and Nature of Nonprofits</a>.)</p>

<p>2. <b>How do you know there is a need for your new product
or service?</b> 
<br />You'll have to do more than &quot;sense that there is a need&quot;
or claim that &quot;it's common sense that there is a need&quot;.
You'll have to have enough evidence to convince an investor or
funder -- and yourself. Read information at a few of the links
in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm"
class="textlink">Marketing Research</a> to help you. (Nonprofit
entrepreneurs should strongly consider collaborating with an existing
nonprofit, rather than starting a new nonprofit that might end
up competing for the same funds. To see if a relevant nonprofit
already exists, you might contact your local office of the <a
href="http://www.ncna.org/" target="_blank" class="textlink">National
Council of Nonprofit Associations</a> or use the <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/"
