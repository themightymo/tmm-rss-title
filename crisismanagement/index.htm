<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What Really Constitutes a Business Crisis?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-nayor/a/861/17/" target="_blank">Michael 
  Nayor</a></p>
<p>There are many types of issues facing businesses, but what counts as a true 
  crisis?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always immediately apparent when your organization is in the 
  initial stages of a crisis. To this effect, I am pleased to bring you a guest 
  blog submission by Michael Nayor, founder and CEO of crisis consulting firm 
  The Rhodell Group, that investigates &#8220;What Really Constitutes a Business 
  Crisis.&#8221;</p>
<h3>What is a Business Crisis?</h3>
<p>A business crisis can be anything that can negatively effect a company&#8217;s 
  reputation or bottom line. Many events at first blush may not appear to be serious. 
  HP&#8217;s firing of Mark Hurd and the subsequent entanglement with Oracle was 
  not a big deal in the scheme of things, even though internally it must have 
  been a shocker. However, the death or resignation of a key person in any organization 
  could very well be serious for any company depending on just how key that person 
  really was. Natural catastrophes, product recalls, labor disputes, computer 
  data losses. The list is endless. Some are temporary. Some can cause the demise 
  of a company. Most can be handled with honesty and the realization that it may 
  be necessary to absorb losses over the short haul in order to achieve a long 
  and healthy business life.</p>
<h3>Two Categories of Business Crises</h3>
<p>Two distinct categories of crisis need to be recognized. In one we lump all 
  those events over which we have no control, such as product tampering by outside 
  forces or natural disasters. Even in these situations there are always some 
  actions we can take: tamper-proof packaging, liability insurance, proper protocols. 
  But generally these events can blind-side us.</p>
<p>The second category contains all those events that might have been avoided 
  had we chosen to take the actions necessary to protect ourselves and the public. 
  Some are obvious. We look at the BP oil spill and see things that surely could 
  have been done. Other events are not so obvious and these are the ones that 
  can be insidious. When a management believes it is doing the right thing but 
  in fact is fueling a potential crisis we have the makings of a catastrophe. 
  A couple of examples will make this abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Market share is usually very important to a company, oddly sometimes more important 
  than the bottom line. There is always great competition for new customers. Many 
  times the efforts and resources devoted to advertising, marketing and selling 
  to new customers are at the expense of a company&#8217;s loyal customer base. 
  This can even be seen at the local level. Where I live heating oil companies 
  consistently offer new customers a deal for the first year in order to lure 
  them in. This, of course, is done at the expense of old, loyal customers who 
  have to make up the slack. The result is that many savvy oil customers these 
  days do a lot of shopping each year to find the best deal. Loyalty is a thing 
  of the past. On a national level the problem has gotten even more serious. A 
  recent financial story in The New Yorker last month observed that there is almost 
  universal recognition that customer service in this country has deteriorated. 
  Such service is considered a &#8220;cost&#8221;. Companies are looking for the 
  customers they don&#8217;t have so they are willing to spend on marketing and 
  advertising but are not as interested in adding to their costs of service. The 
  article made it sound a little like cynical dating. Companies are interested 
  in luring you in but then once they have you, they don&#8217;t quite value you 
  as much as the next potential customer they want to corral.</p>
<p>Lack of service is not just a pain for helpless consumers. In this internet 
  age they can do something about it. This is how a company can sow the seeds 
  of its own destruction, and inexorably create its own crisis. Companies and 
  their products and services are being rated on the internet and consumers don&#8217;t 
  hold back. They tell it like it is. Granted, competitors may be planting some 
  of these negative comments but for the most part product and service evaluations 
  are being taken at face value. The moral of the story: be faithful to those 
  who brought you to the dance, or the consequences could be severe.</p>
<h3>Another form of self-inflicted crisis involves weathering the storm</h3>
<p>Whether in politics, professional sports, or in business, &#8220;players&#8221; 
  still believe that because of their importance they can ride out any issue or 
  problem. They can&#8217;t. We can all easily tick off a dozen or so examples, 
  but the latest is surprising. Johnson &amp; Johnson has recently gone through 
  a spate of recalls of tainted children&#8217;s Tylenol and Motrin. The Company 
  has generally kept a low profile and even contracted with a third party to buy 
  up Motrin off retail shelves rather than announce an actual recall. And for 
  the last decade it has been settling with claimants for a variety of injuries 
  and death allegedly due from Ortho Evra, a contraceptive patch made by its subsidiary, 
  Ortho McNeil. It appears clear that the current management of J&amp;J has not 
  followed in the footsteps of the management that handled the Tylenol crisis 
  of 1982 which is often cited as the quintessential example of crisis management 
  in modern corporate history. Back then cyanide had been found in bottles of 
  Tylenol in the Chicago area. J&amp;J immediately issued public warnings, issued 
  a product recall, created tamper-proof packaging, and before long was back in 
  business. The Company was up-front and willing to bite the bullet in the best 
  interests of the public. Unfortunately that does not appear to be the philosophy 
  today. There is clearly a danger in believing one&#8217;s invincibility. The 
  trust and respect of the public is at stake, and once lost, is very difficult 
  to retrieve.</p>
<p>A crisis is not just the obvious explosion at a plant or a mine. Companies 
  can and do create their own crises. Companies must evaluate their philosophy, 
  their strategy and their honesty. They must take action to minimize their vulnerabilities 
  but at the same time be prepared to take action in the best interests of the 
  public if they value company longevity.</p>

<h2>What is Crisis Management?</h2>
<p>Crisis management is the nature of activities to respond to a major threat 
  to a person, group or organization. Crisis management is a relatively new field 
  of management. Typically, proactive crisis management activities include forecasting 
  potential crises and planning how to deal with them, for example, how to recover 
  if your computer system completely fails. Many people would refer to this, instead, 
  as risk management and not crisis management. </p>
<p>Hopefully, organizations have time and resources to complete a crisis management 
  plan before they experience a crisis. Crisis management in the face of a current, 
  real crisis includes identifying the real nature of a current crisis, intervening 
  to minimize damage and recovering from the crisis. Crisis management often includes 
  strong focus on public relations to recover any damage to public image and assure 
  stakeholders that recovery is underway. (The library includes a variety of related 
  topics.)</p>

<h2><a name="social" id="social"></a>Guidelines for Successful Social Crisis Planning</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.bernsteincrisismanagement.com/bios.html" target="_blank">Jonathan 
  L. Bernstein</a></p>
<p>As it stands today, crisis management is very much entwined with social media. 
  Whether you like it or not, when trouble hits you&#8217;ve got to quickly meet 
  your stakeholders in the places they frequent in order to maintain control of 
  your story, and that means being ready. In an article for <a href="http://www.business2community.com/social-media/reporting-back-from-sxsw-how-social-media-impacts-crisis-communications-019077/" target="_blank">business2community.com</a>, 
  David Vap provided some solid tips for getting your organization in position 
  to handle social crises:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong> Understand your organization. </strong>Review external communication 
    processes, social capabilities, and corporate culture. This is where we recommend 
    scenario planning. Key questions could include: how would we respond if a 
    vocal customer complaint suddenly went viral? How would we respond to a brandjacking 
    attack?</li>
  <li><strong>Create a new social mindset in your organization</strong>. The social 
    shift calls for a mindset characterized by transparency, accountability, employee 
    empowerment, and planned spontaneity. Technology is certainly a crucial component 
    of dealing with crisis communication, but preparing processes and practices 
    must come first.</li>
  <li><strong>Know your consumers. </strong>Listen to conversations unfolding 
    on the social web about your brand, and respond/employ proactive social support. 
    Also identify your customer advocates on the social web &#8211; they will 
    be invaluable in the event of a crisis.</li>
  <li><strong>Form a social crisis team. </strong>A successful social strategy 
    must cross the boundaries of department and hierarchy because consumers expect 
    a seamless experience. Build a cross-functional team, including a social media 
    manager, a product owner, and at least one executive sponsor. Draw up a social 
    team charter to clarify roles and responsibilities and create an internal 
    collaboration space for this team. </li>
  <li><strong>Roll out a social crisis communications plan. </strong>Develop a 
    playbook with guidelines for the social crisis team. Define an escalation 
    process for potential PR issues. Build feedback into every step so you can 
    adapt. Your plan needs to think through three areas &#8211; process and culture 
    (what / who needs to change), technologies and tools (what to use to get there), 
    and key metrics (what to track).</li>
</ol>
<p>I especially like this list because of step two, &#8220;create a new social 
  mindset in your organization.&#8221; Far too many businesses create social media 
  accounts and install fancy managing programs but neglect proper training and 
  education, not only stifling possible gains but also creating the risk of improper 
  use, which raises the chance of crisis even further.</p>
