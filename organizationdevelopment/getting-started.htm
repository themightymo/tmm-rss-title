<h1>Organization Development (OD) -- 
Getting Started and Remaining Up-to-Date</h1>

<!--[index|Organizational Development]-->

<p>Assembled by <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD</a></p>

<p>There are a wide variety of business-, management- and organization-related
practices in the field of organization development. Consequently,
there may be a wide variety of perspectives about the knowledge
and skills needed by a practitioner in organization development.</p>

<p>However, a highly skilled OD practitioner should have a wide
set of competencies if he or she is to be effective in addressing
organization-wide problems and goals. Information on this page
is geared to help you develop your knowledge and skills to be
-- and remain -- an effective practitioner in organization development.</p>

<p>The following advice is from one perspective offered by Carter
McNamara, MBA, PhD. Those seeking to expand and evolve their knowledge
and skills in OD certainly should seek as many perspectives as
possible on how to get started in OD and how to remain effective
as an OD practitioner.</p>

<h2>First, Get a Basic Impression of OD and
Competencies Needed by OD Practitioners</h2>
<p>

The field of organization development encompasses a
wide set of practices. However, all of these practices contribute
towards increasing the effectiveness of organizations and their
members. Get an impression of what OD is by reading<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationdevelopment/od-defined.htm">What is Organization Development?</a>
</p>

<p>You might glance at the list of topics throughout <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalchange/index.htm">Organization
Development and Change (includes field of OD)</a>
to get a sense for some of the knowledge and skills involved in
OD practices. Note that the organization and listing of the topics
in the Library are not meant to represent a complete and &quot;official&quot;
list of standardized competencies needed by an OD practitioner.</p>

<p>When trying to understand the competencies needed by OD practitioners,
you'll benefit from reviewing the report presented to the ODC
Division of the Academy of Management:<br />
<a href="http://division.aomonline.org/odc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66:odc-competencies-report&amp;catid=47:odc-competencies&amp;Itemid=70" target="_blank">ODC Competencies Report</a><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Next, Round Out Your Understanding of OD
-- Learn the Basic &quot;Territory&quot; of OD</h2>
<p>

There is a rich history of research, theories, models and practices
in the field of OD. It would be highly questionable to call oneself
an &quot;OD professional&quot; without having studied at least
some of the key works that focus on the field of OD. See the "Recommended Books" referenced from the bottom of this page.</a>
</p>

<h2>Next, Strongly Consider Enrolling In an
OD-Training Program</h2>
<p>

There are a number of very fine education institutions
that provide solid programs in organization development. The following
link references many of the major programs. See<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationdevelopment/competencies.htm">Educational Programs in Organization Development (OD)</a>
</p>

<h2>Understand the Role of Consultant</h2>
<p>

OD practitioners are often consultants to organizations,
whether &quot;internal&quot; (that is, hired as employees to the
organization) or &quot;external&quot; (hired as independent contractors
by the organization). Therefore, it's important to have a good
understanding of the role of a consultant, including how they
are sought and used by clients. The following link might be useful:<br />

and Working with Consultants</a><br />
</p>

<h2>Realize That Without Practice There is No
Knowledge</h2>
<p>

Similar to skills in management, skills in organization
development may be as much art as science. There are many rapidly
changing dynamics in the systems of organizations and human systems.
Without practice, it can be very difficult to evolve a head full
of information to a heart full of skills. Therefore, seek opportunities
to apply new information and materials from OD books and educational
programs. Consider:<br />
1) Joining a network of OD professionals -- here's a <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationdevelopment/index.htm#anchor318803">list</a>
of some other OD organizations<br />
2) <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/mentoring.htm#anchor4294745062">Getting
a mentor</a><br />
3) Volunteer to provide OD services to nonprofits in your
community<br />
4) Seek to &quot;ride the coattails&quot; of an experienced OD
practitioner as she/he completes various projects to improve organization-wide
performance.</p>

<h2>Network, Network and Network!</h2>
<p>You can learn a great deal by interacting and working
with other OD practitioners. Here are some suggestions for networking:<br />
1) Join an <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalchange/index.htm#anchor321927">OD-Related Organization.</a><br />
2) Join one or more discussion groups (see those listed from the right-hand side of this page.</p>

<h2>Commit to Continuous Learning</h2>
<p>

Today's organizations are changing rapidly as a result
of increasing globalization, diversity and public consciousness.
Therefore, the key to success in any organization is the ability
to manage change -- thus, the increasing priority on continuous
learning.</p>

<p>As organizations must change, so must we professionals in organization
development. We must continually be open to -- and be able to
manage -- our own learning. We can't change organizations if we
can't change ourselves.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
