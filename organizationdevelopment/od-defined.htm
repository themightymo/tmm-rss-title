<h3>Definitions and Descriptions of the Field of Organization Development</h3>

<p>Simply put, an Organization Development practitioner is to an organization 
  as a physician is to a human body. The practitioner &quot;diagnoses&quot; (or 
  discovers) the most important priorities to address in the organization, suggests 
  a change-management plan, and then guides the organization through the necessary 
  change. There are different definitions and views on how the change should occur.</p>
<p>NOTE: This site distinguishes the difference between &quot;organizational development&quot; 
  and &quot;Organization Development.&quot; The former phrase refers to the nature 
  and scope of change in organizations, i.e., the change is to the entire organization 
  or to a significant portion of the organization. The latter phrase refers to 
  a field of well-trained people with expertise in guiding successful organizational 
  development. </p>

<h2>An Old Standard Definition of OD</h2>

<p>The nature and needs of organizations are changing dramatically.
Correspondingly, the profession of organization development (OD)
has been changing to meet the changing needs of organizations.
Therefore, it may be most useful to consider several definitions
of organization development. Here's a standard definition. The
next section gives some contrasting definitions.</p>

<p>For many years, the following definition was perhaps the standard
definition for OD. The following definition was developed in 1969
at a time when an organization was considered to be much like
a stable machine comprised of interlocking parts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#147;Organization Development is an effort planned, organization-wide,
  and managed from the top, to increase organization effectiveness
  and health through planned interventions in the organization's
  'processes,' using behavioral-science knowledge.&#148; <br />
  -- Beckhard, &#147;Organization development: Strategies and Models&#148;,
  Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1969, p. 9.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>New Definitions of OD</h2>

<p>Today's organizations operate in a rapidly changing environment.
Consequently, one of the most important assets for an organization
is the ability to manage change -- and for people to remain healthy
and authentic. Consider the following definition of OD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#147;Organization Development is the attempt to influence
  the members of an organization to expand their candidness with
  each other about their views of the organization and their experience
  in it, and to take greater responsibility for their own actions
  as organization members. The assumption behind OD is that when
  people pursue both of these objectives simultaneously, they are
  likely to discover new ways of working together that they experience
  as more effective for achieving their own and their shared (organizational)
  goals. And that when this does not happen, such activity helps
  them to understand why and to make meaningful choices about what
  to do in light of this understanding.&#148; <br />
  -- Neilsen, &#147;Becoming an OD Practitioner&#148;, Englewood
  Cliffs, CA: Prentice-Hall, 1984, pp. 2-3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experts might agree that the following definitions of OD represent
the major focus and thrust of many of today's OD practitioners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Organization development is a system-wide application
  of behavioral science knowledge to the planned development and
  reinforcement of organizational strategies, structures, and processes
  for improving an organization's effectiveness.&quot;<br />
  -- Cummings and Worley, &quot;Organization Development and Change&quot;,
  Sixth Edition, South-Western Publishing, 1997, p.2.</p>
  <p>&quot;Organization Development is a body of knowledge and
  practice that enhances organizational performance and individual
  development, viewing the organization as a complex system of
  systems that exist within a larger system, each of which has
  its own attributes and degrees of alignment. OD interventions
  in these systems are inclusive methodologies and approaches to
  strategic planning, organization design, leadership development,
  change management, performance management, coaching, diversity,
  and work/life balance.&quot;<br />
  -- Matt Minahan, MM &amp; Associates, Silver Spring, Maryland</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>OD Practitioners: &quot;Organizational Physicians&quot;?</h2>

<p>The system of organizations is very similar, if not the same
as, the system of human beings -- after all, organizations are
made up of humans! Therefore, when trying to understand the field
of organization development, it might be useful to compare aspects
of the field of organization development to aspects of the field
of medicine.</p>

<p>For example, the study of the theories and structures of organizations
(often in courses called &quot;organizational theory&quot;) is
similar to the study of anatomy and physiology of human systems.
Similarly, the study of organizational behavior is similar to
the study of psychology and sociology in human systems. Finally,
the study and field of organization development compares to the
study and field of medicine regarding human systems.</p>

<p>That is, in OD, practitioners might work in a manner similar
to &quot;organizational physicians&quot; intending to improve
the effectiveness of people and organizations by:</p>

<p>1) Establishing relationships with key personnel in the organization
(often called &quot;entering&quot; and &quot;contracting&quot;
with the organization);</p>

<p>2) Researching and evaluating systems in the organization to
understand dysfunctions and/or goals of the systems in the organization
(&quot;diagnosing&quot; the systems in the organization);</p>

<p>3) Identifying approaches (or &quot;interventions&quot;) to
improve effectiveness of the organization and its people;</p>

<p>4) Applying approaches to improve effectiveness (methods of
&quot;planned change&quot; in the organization),</p>

<p>5) Evaluating the ongoing effectiveness of the approaches and
their results.</p>

<h2>From &quot;Linear&quot; to &quot;Holistic&quot; OD?</h2>

<p>Note that the above-mentioned, &quot;linear&quot; approach
to organization development is coming under fire. Not all organization
development practitioners appreciate terms such as &quot;diagnosing&quot;
an organization, &quot;interventions&quot; to improve effectiveness,
etc.</p>

<h2>Maturation of the Field</h2>

<p>OD has a rich field of research, theory, models and practice,
with roots in community and management development. eNotes provides a <a href="http://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/organizational-development"
target="_blank" class="textlink">history of organization
development</a>.</p>

<p>The topic of organizational change has received a great deal
of attention over the past several decades, as organizations face
new and complex challenges like never before. Correspondingly,
the field of Organization Development is receiving a great deal
of attention now, too. As the field has grown, so has the diversity
of perspectives on the field. The question &quot;What is OD?&quot;
is now quite common in discussions among those interested in the
field.</p>

<p>OD does not have a standard code of ethics or universal accrediting
body. Thus, many assert that OD is a field, rather than a profession.
The OD Institute admirably does suggest levels of certification
for OD practitioners, (see the next section, Suggested Competencies
for OD Practitioners), but these do not appear to have become
standard for practitioners who consider themselves to be OD professionals.
The OD Institute has also suggested an <a href="http://www.theodinstitute.org/od-library/code_of_ethics.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">International Organization Development
Code of Ethics</a>. The <a href="http://www.odnetwork.org/" class="textlink">Organization
Development Network</a> is a large organization that also focuses
on developing the field and serving its members, many of whom
are OD practitioners.</p>

<p>Many people assert that OD is a field that works from a systems
perspective and according to humanistic values to help people
change. Other people respond that other fields or professions,
such as trainers and community organizers, also work from a systems
perspective and according to humanistic values and, thus, that
description is not unique to OD. They assert that OD must proclaim
a scope for their field and suggest that a more apt description
of OD is that it is a field that works from a systems perspective
and according to humanistic values to enhance the performance
of organizations.</p>

<p>Another area of diversity about perspectives on Organization
Development is in regard to how people view organizations. Some
focus on the structures, operations, positions, procedures, etc.,
while others focus on the human relations and interactions. Still
others focus on the politics and power, while others focus on
the cultures and values of the organization. The following article
gives more information about these perspectives: <a href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/lens-on-orgs.pdf"
class="textlink">Understand the Preferred Lens Through Which You
View Organizations</a></p>

<p>Concurrently, there seems to be strong focus on &quot;soft&quot;
skills in OD, for example, coaching, leadership development, facilitation,
conflict management, process consulting, etc. However, many would
assert that the &quot;hard&quot; skills, such as Balanced Scorecard,
quality management initiatives (TQM, Six Sigma, etc.), strategic
analysis, etc., should also be a focus in OD. The following article
gives more information about these perspectives: <a href="http://www.nickols.us/ODTypology.pdf"
class="textlink">What Type of OD Practitioner Are You?</a></p>

<p>Concurrent to these diverse views, there seems to be strong
agreement that the phrase &quot;organizational change and development&quot;
describes the core purpose and practice of what OD practitioners
do -- so much that the phrase &quot;organizational development&quot;
is often used interchangeably to refer to the field itself.</p>

<p>There are a wide range of knowledge, skills and abilities that
one might consider when learning about OD. The following links
are to guidelines and suggestions from a variety of OD experts.<br />

target="_blank">Scoring a Place in OD: Skills for the Transition</a></p>

<h3>Learn Business Skills, Too</h3>

<p>Efforts at organizational change can fail, not only because
of people's beliefs and feelings and perceptions (which seems
to be the primary focus of many OD training programs today), but
also because of business goals and structures and operations.
In this case, it might even be damaging to focus only on OD models
that get peoples' buy-in to the change, help people overcome resistance
to the change, etc., but don't really consider the &quot;business&quot;
side of things. Therefore, it would be wise for the OD practitioners
to get at least some basic understanding of certain business topics.
The following links are to online programs to start and development
organizations, and include focus on the business aspects, as well.
