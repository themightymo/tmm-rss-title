<h2>Competencies to Learn in OD</h2>

<p>There are a wide range of knowledge, skills and abilities that one might consider 
  when learning about OD. The following links are to guidelines and suggestions 
  from a variety of OD experts.</p>
<p>NOTE: This site distinguishes the difference between &quot;organizational development&quot; 
  and &quot;Organization Development.&quot; The former phrase refers to the nature 
  and scope of change in organizations, i.e., the change is to the entire organization 
  or to a significant portion of the organization. The latter phrase refers to 
  a field of well-trained people with expertise in guiding successful organizational 
  development. </p>

<h2>Learn Business Skills, Too</h2>

<p>Efforts at organizational change can fail, not only because
of people's beliefs and feelings and perceptions (which are the
focus of many OD training programs today), but also because of
business goals and structures and operations. In this case, it
might even be damaging to focus only on OD models that get peoples'
buy-in to the change, help people overcome resistance to the change,
etc.</p>

<p>Therefore, it would be wise for the OD practitioners to get
at least some basic understanding of certain business topics.
If your OD school and training does not include some basic skills
in business, then see</p>
