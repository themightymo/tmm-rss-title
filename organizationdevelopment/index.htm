<p>NOTE: This site distinguishes the difference between &quot;organizational development&quot; 
  and &quot;Organization Development.&quot; The former phrase refers to the nature 
  and scope of change in organizations, i.e., the change is to the entire organization 
  or to a significant portion of the organization. The latter phrase refers to 
  a field of well-trained people with expertise in guiding successful organizational 
  development. (For training about consulting to organizations, see the <a href="http://www.consultantsdevelopmentinstitute.org/">Consultants 
  Development Institute</a>.)</p>

<h2>About the Field of Organization Development</h2>

<p>The field of Organization Development (OD) is focused on improving the effectiveness 
  of organizations and the people in those organizations. The nature of organizational 
  change is very much at the core of working in the field of OD. Organizational 
  change and Organization Development are often referenced together. Therefore, 
  the reader might be served by reviewing information in the topic, which includes 
  description of the field, various educational programs in OD, and books to read 
  about OD.</p>

<h2>Understanding Yourself as an Instrument of Change</h2>

<p>Your nature and the way you choose to work has significant
impact on your client's organization. You cannot separate yourself
from your client's organization, as if you are some kind of detached
observer. You become part of your client's system. Thus, it is
critical that you have a good understanding of yourself, including
your biases (we all have them), how you manage feedback and conflict,
how you like to make decisions and solve problems, how you naturally
view organizations, your skills as a consultant, etc. The following
document explains each of these considerations in more detail
and ends with a quick self-assessment.<br />

Yourself as Instrument of Change</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor315783"></a></p>

<h2>Understanding Organizations, Leadership and Management</h2>

<p>A highly effective OD practitioner has strong understanding
of the systems, structures and processes in an organization --
and how those systems, structures and processes are managed. The
following links (reviewed in the following order) might be helpful
to establish some sense about organizations and their management.

<p><a name="anchor316012"></a></p>

<h2>Understanding Community Organizing</h2>

<p>We OD practitioners sometimes forget that OD has its roots
in community development (through works of Benne, Lewin, etc.).
Community organizers are often deep in the &quot;trenches&quot;
working challenges such as organizational design, organizational
transformation, leadership development, conflict management, etc.<br />

<p><a name="anchor316323"></a></p>

<h2>Understanding Performance Management</h2>

<p>Organizational change should not be conducted for the sake
of change. Organizational change efforts should be geared to improve
performance of organizations and people in those organizations.
Therefore, it's useful for OD practitioners to have an understanding
of what is meant by &quot;performance&quot; and methods to manage
performance in organizations. <br />

<h2>Stages of Organization Development Process</h2>

<p>The typical OD process and the consulting process often follow
an action research approach. Consequently, there is often an overlap
between materials that are useful to both processes. Also, there
are many variations of the process, including by combining various
phases and/or splitting some into more phases.</p>
