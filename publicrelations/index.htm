<p>Public relations activities aim to cultivate a strong, positive
image of the organization among its stakeholders. Similar to effective
advertising and promotions, effective public relations often depends
on designing and implementing a well-designed public relations
plan. The plan often includes description of what you want to
convey to whom, how you plan to convey it, who is responsible
to convey it and by when, and how much money is budgeted to fund
these activities. Similar to advertising and promotions, a media
plan and calendar can be very useful, which specifies what media
methods to be used and when. One of the more recent, important
public relations activities is maintaining -- and sometimes restoring
-- a strong public image on the Web.</p>
