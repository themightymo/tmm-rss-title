<h2><a name="help" id="help"></a>Look Out, It's the Media! Run! Basic Mistakes/Assumptions 
  People Make 1.0</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.mediasavantcom.com/" target="_blank">Martin Keller</a></p>
<p>In my PR career, I've heard some unbelievable things people have said about 
  &quot;The Media.&quot; Things that made &quot;The Media&quot; out to be some 
  kind of monolithic machine, the political equivalent of the Teabagger viewpoint 
  about &quot;The Government&quot; (as if &quot;The Government&quot; were one 
  entity. Seriously, are they mad at the Department of Agriculture, or The Business 
  Transformation Office over at the Department of Defense?!)</p>
<p>Still, the big bad &quot;Media&quot; is there to report news and if you have 
  bad news, it generally will be reported in some fashion. There are ways, however, 
  to diffuse the fear or anxiety of dealing with &quot;The Media.&quot; Some of 
  these true examples hopefully underscore my point:</p>
<h3>1) &quot;Are they going to look for skeletons?&quot;</h3>
<p>This was asked by one worried small business owner who was going to be profiled. 
  If the business desk is assigning an Investigative Reporter to your story, yes. 
  However General Assignment reporters are not there to dig up the dirt and look 
  for bones, they simply want your story. They don’t have another agenda. Having 
  a good media kit and key messages in place to hand off to someone in the media 
  puts up guardrails to help focus your business or issues on what’s important 
  and positive.</p>
<h3>2) &quot;Can I review the story before it’s written?&quot;</h3>
<p>Hardly ever, although sometimes the rare reporter who gets really want to get 
  it right, or is challenged by a complex issue about something your company does, 
  or something you did, will let you review for accuracy but not content changes. 
  That’s why media training in advance of interviews with &quot;The Media&quot; 
  to stay on message is a good thing to do.</p>
<h3>3) &quot;I have an event on Friday night that I would love to get some coverage 
  of before that, can it happen?&quot;</h3>
<p>This was asked by someone once in a cold call two days before the event. Unless 
  you've got the president of the US or Leonardo DiCaprio at your shindig — or 
  have truly invented a whizbang device that no one has ever seen before — chances 
  are almost nil.</p>
<p>Even with a news cycle that turns over 10 times a day or more on the internet, 
  sufficient lead times are important to adhere to. Give yourself — or your PR 
  person a few weeks in advance of when you want your story &quot;out there&quot; 
  to contact the right person in &quot;The Media&quot; (Note: Magazines are often 
  working 4-6 months ahead of real time.) Breaking News is one thing that gets 
  instant coverage, but that is usually a tragedy of some sort unfolding or a 
  national or international incident (although these days, a celebrity marriage 
  break up or drug bust, or even a car chase in Oklahoma, unfortunately qualify). 
  Investor Relations is a whole other universe, and we won't go there today.</p>
<h3>4) &quot;The Media&quot; will make my company famous. </h3>
<p>Well, it could. Overall, a few stories well placed will increase your visibility, 
  hopefully help drive sales and/or achieve some of the objectives you set forth 
  once you engaged a PR company or put your PR strategy into motion.</p>
<p>But let's be realistic. Most overnight success stories I know of took 10 years 
  of hard work. PR — as a wise friend once described it — is like drip irrigation 
  in the desert: Droplets of water falling on the plant eventually produce a bloom, 
  and if you're lucky, fruit.</p>
<h3>5) &quot;Can I get the photo/video/radio interview The Media?&quot;</h3>
<p>Generally no. It becomes the intellectual property of the paper, television 
  or radio station. You can get back copies or links of the paper you need for 
  a price. And there are services to obtain DVD copies or links to something that 
  ran on TV, or a radio interview. Usually all such copies come with legal guidelines 
  about how the material may or may not be used. Always have your own photos on 
  hand (sometimes &quot;The Media&quot; will request it — and maybe even your 
  own b-roll — footage that tells your story in images as background, if appropriate).</p>
<p>Remember, dealing with &quot;The Media&quot; is like dealing with other human 
  beings. Sure, people working in the profession hold a power to magnify what 
  you do. But the last time I checked, those doing it were like you and me, 90% 
  water.</p>

<h2>Release Yourself from the Press Release</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.StorytellerToTheMedia.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Tennant Nicholson</a></p>
<h3>Press Releases or Not?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this as gently as I can: Press releases don&#8217;t always 
  work. So don&#8217;t send them out thinking they&#8217;re going to get you on 
  Oprah, The Today Show, Good Morning America or CBS Early Show. A lot of people 
  still think press releases are the best way to get the media to notice them, 
  but to the busy media professional, press releases say: &#8220;Here&#8217;s 
  something everyone is going to get at the same time as you. No scoop for you!&#8221;</p>
<h3>When Press Releases Work</h3>
<p>Now I'm not saying they don't work for search engine optimization purposes. 
  Press releases are great for that. They:</p>
<ul>
  <li> build links back to your site</li>
  <li>build your branding and messaging online and</li>
  <li>increase your credibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to send out press releases if you're a corporate entity and need 
  the message to be searchable on news wire services in the future. And reporters 
  are not likely to ignore your press release if you have true breaking news, 
  such as a plant expansion that will add hundreds of jobs in a local coverage 
  area.</p>
<h3>Relationship Building</h3>
<p>But sending out press releases is not the most effective way to score the coveted 
  news features that you'll want. That is done with relationship building. Nothing 
  beats &#8220;dial and smile&#8221; phone calls, personalized emails and perfect 
  pitches.</p>
<p>Organizing an online press kit with ready-to-use story ideas, quotes and background 
  will help you get your message out and make it easier for the media to cover 
  you. And making it easy for the media will definitely boost your odds of being 
  chosen as a source in articles, TV segments and radio broadcasts.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>Also, with social networking sites, it&#8217;s easier than ever to build a 
  buzz about your product or service. You can take your message direct to the 
  audience you seek with a great website, some search engine optimization or a 
  Facebook friends link.</p>
<p>To score media coverage and build credibility though, there&#8217;s still no 
  substitute for personal contact with your target media. Get to know them and 
  make them feel special. Read their articles and tune in to their shows. Educate 
  yourself on the different specialty or niche areas they cover.</p>
<h3>Your Story</h3>
<p>Dig in. Most businesses have untold stories that are interesting. It may be 
  something about how they got started or how they developed a new product or 
  service. So find the compelling story about your business or product.</p>
<p>Then make a list of those media people you would like to cover your story and 
  begin building relationships with them &#8212; send them the press release before 
  everyone else gets it. Give them the scoop before you announce it to the world. 
  Making the media feel special is a sure-fire way to have them come back and 
  ask for more scoops from you.</p>
