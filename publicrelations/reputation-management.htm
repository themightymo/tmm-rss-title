  <li> Focus on Google for search results; the other search engines will follow 
    suit over time.</li>
  <li>Review your website for keyword placement and density (keyword/total word 
    ratio); you won&#8217;t be found if the keywords are not present in the proper 
    configuration (i.e. there are requirements for the number of keywords used 
    in different parts of the code that creates the page).</li>
  <li>Update your website frequently; stale sites drop fast and fresh information 
    keeps your site sticky (viewers stay and return).</li>
  <li>Present clear calls-to-action; give your visitor a reason to respond.</li>
  <li>Validate your web pages for error-free code; Google will downgrade poorly 
    constructed websites.</li>
  <li>Content must be relevant to both the website and the web page.</li>
  <li>Avoid Flash content and frames pages; these websites cannot be reliably 
    indexed.</li>
  <li>Obtain inbound links from relevant, high-profile websites with good PageRank.</li>
  <li>Create multiple points-of-presence (e.g., blogs, article publication, activity 
    at forums, social media), where you can get as many positive messages out 
    as possible, pushing the negative messages down on a search engine results 
    page.</li>
  <li>Monitor your results constantly and adapt quickly based on the results.</li>

<h2><a name="online" id="online"></a>Online Reputation Management - Monitor Your 
  Web Presence</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/" target="_blank">Robert Stretch</a></p>
<p>Since anybody can publish anything online, protecting your brand is more critical 
  than ever. One or two bad reviews wield more power than ever by influencing 
  potential customers and colleagues.</p>
<p>Damage control in the form of (ORM) needs to be one of your top priorities. 
  Online reputation management is monitoring your company&#8217;s web presence 
  across the internet. It means watching competitors&#8217; websites, keeping 
  up to date on social media mentions, and monitoring what is said about you through 
  the search engines.</p>
<h3>What is ORM?</h3>
<p>The gist of ORM is to keep negative content about you, your company and/or 
  brand from popping up on the World Wide Web. Though it sounds tasking, ORM requires 
  little time as long as it&#8217;s conducted routinely. To get started, follow 
  a few easy steps to keep your online rep clean.</p>
<h3>Think Like the Slanderers</h3>
<p>People who want to ruin your reputation&#8212;such as disgruntled ex-employees 
  or angry customers &#8212; may go to unthinkable lengths to do so. However, 
  if you try to anticipate their moves, you give yourself an advantage. For example, 
  it&#8217;s a good idea to buy domains similar to your primary one. But your 
  slanderers might buy domains that defame you, such as johndoefails.com. Of course, 
  if you buy these first, no one else can claim them.</p>
<h3>Defend Yourself</h3>
<p>ORM is just as much about creating new content as it is countering existing 
  content. First, you need to discover complaints before you post a rebuttal. 
  Start by creating a Google alert. An example for our company would be VA Mortgage 
  Center.com complaint, and variations of that. Once you know where the content 
  is, you may appropriately defend yourself. Getting loyal customers to write 
  testimonials is a great strategy. There&#8217;s no harm in asking customers 
  for their support via positive reviews on websites such as Yelp.</p>
<h3>Stay Up To Date</h3>
<p>Though that Google alert will help, it&#8217;s a search confined only to Google&#8217;s 
  servers. Scavenging the rest of the information superhighway means manually 
  searching certain terms on Yahoo!, Bing, AltaVista and Dogpile. Branch out, 
  and try different phrases that include your name/brand/company.</p>
<h3>Produce and Publish</h3>
<p>Now that you know what you&#8217;re up against, it&#8217;s time to produce 
  content. Blogs are a great, inexpensive method of publishing content. From there, 
  you can share what you&#8217;ve done on social networking sites. Don&#8217;t 
  get too carried away in your work by boasting excessively, but highlight some 
  recent accomplishments. </p>
<p>Consider making your work a weekly or bi-monthly piece that covers everything 
  you or your company has done. Remember, ORM is about proving that you&#8217;re 
  a professional in your field and keeping that image squeaky clean.</p>
