<h2><a name="pr" id="pr"></a>What is Public Relations?</h2>
<p>Public relations activities aim to cultivate a strong, positive image of the 
  organization among its stakeholders. Similar to effective advertising and promotions, 
  effective public relations often depends on designing and implementing a well-designed 
  public relations plan. The plan often includes description of what you want 
  to convey to whom, how you plan to convey it, who is responsible to convey it 
  and by when, and how much money is budgeted to fund these activities. Similar 
  to advertising and promotions, a media plan and calendar can be very useful, 
  which specifies what media methods to be used and when. One of the more recent, 
  important public relations activities is maintaining -- and sometimes restoring 
  -- a strong public image on the Web.</p>

<h2><a name="why" id="why"></a>Why Do Public Relations?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.mediasavantcom.com/" target="_blank">Martin Keller</a></p>
<p>Do you have a new business, or a business that&#8217;s mature but needs some 
  greater visibility? Are you launching a new product? If you&#8217;re a non-profit, 
  are policy issues or board blow ups finding their way into the community you 
  serve? Are you looking for new employees who understand what you do?</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of why a company or non-profit (new, small or 
  large), or an individual would undertake a public relations campaign. The goal 
  of PR in general is to influence positive activities and outcomes related to 
  what you do. If you&#8217;re a new business, what better way to create visibility 
  than to do publicity. Nearly every city of any size has a business section of 
  the daily paper, and many cities have weekly business publications and at least 
  one monthly business magazine (in the media-rich area like Minneapolis-St. Paul 
  where I&#8217;m based, we have three business magazines and two business weeklies 
  &#8212; plus some specialty publications for banking and financial services!!)</p>
<p>If your company is established but hasn&#8217;t been in the news lately and 
  could use some fresh ink about your growth, new initiatives, innovations or 
  perhaps an acquisition, consider sharing the news. Even new hires will get some 
  notice in the business pubs. And don&#8217;t overlook something interesting 
  one of your employees or your CEO might be doing.</p>
<p>For example, a longtime client who founded an IT company specializing in Business 
  Intelligence (BI), is also an accomplished photographer and has traveled on 
  several trips around the globe to places like India for the annual Camel Fair 
  and Kabul with the world-renowned National Geographic photographer, Steve McCurry 
  (best known for his haunting &#8220;Afghan Girl&#8221; portrait), doing photography 
  seminars in-country. Think that story didn&#8217;t get told here &#8230;..a 
  lot&#8230;? Putting another dimension on business people helps show their human 
  side and helps keep the company name in the public realm.</p>
<p>New product launches scream for a PR campaign, especially if it&#8217;s a consumer 
  product that we all need &#8212; or a new twist on an old one. For people involved 
  in public policy issues, there are many tools in the PR toolbox to help clearly 
  portray your issue or message to constituents, legislators, targeted associations, 
  neighborhood groups or other special interest organizations. We&#8217;ll cover 
  both areas more in separate, future blogs.</p>
<p>Why not just buy and ad? Ideally you would tie a PR campaign to an integrated 
  marketing program &#8212; providing you have the budget and advertising is an 
  appropriate vehicle for what you are trying to accomplish. However &#8212; and 
  I&#8217;m biased, of course &#8212; the return on PR is usually, 95% of time, 
  much better. It has a longer shelf, life, it can be leveraged time and again 
  and best of all, it has a third-party credibility that advertising cannot usually 
  provide. Unless you have landed somebody like Michael Jordan, or the celebrity 
  du jour, to appear in your ad campaign. Good luck with that.</p>

<h3>How to get Your Name in the News</h3>
<p>Do you think Lady Gaga, marketing genius, achieved the distinction of being 
  the most-searched woman on Google without a PR plan? According to ReadWriteWeb.com, 
  &#8220;Lady Gaga was ranked 3rd overall in news coverage, in magazine websites 
  and music blogs, with 4,326 articles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most businesses barely have a marketing plan, much less a written, strategically 
  developed PR Plan. Yet it could be the very thing that helps you save advertising 
  dollars AND gain an edge over your competition.</p>
<h3>Review Last Year&#8217;s PR</h3>
<p>If you received PR coverage, review it for its content. Compare it to last 
  year&#8217;s plan. What got the media&#8217;s attention and what didn&#8217;t? 
  Which editors gave you positive coverage and which gave you negative coverage? 
  Can you tell why? Consider calling them to discuss it.</p>
<p>Search online for all results that include the name of your business. Now do 
  the same thing for your closest competitors. Why did they get the coverage? 
  Were their stories particularly interesting in some way? Did they target media 
  that you didn&#8217;t target? Make a list of these angles and media targets 
  to add to your list of PR objectives.</p>
<h3>Articulate Your PR Objectives</h3>
<p>When you take a vacation, you choose the destination first, right? So start 
  by putting your PR objectives in writing. It can be simple &#8211; even a bullet-pointed 
  list will suffice. Topics to cover will depend upon the type of business, your 
  customers, your competition, and your target media.</p>
<p>Example objectives might include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> New product or service launch coverage</li>
  <li>Company events announced</li>
  <li>Employee promotions or additions spotlighted</li>
</ul>
<h3>PR Tactics and Tools</h3>
<p>With your written PR objectives in front of you, brainstorm activities that 
  will help you plan and execute effective and consistent PR tactics. Consistency 
  is the key, so get out a calendar or create a timeline as an integral part of 
  your plan.</p>
<p>Try these additional PR tactics:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create a comprehensive PR contact list, with their preferred method of 
    being contacted (ex: email or fax?)</li>
  <li>For each media, list their deadlines. If they come up short for content 
    at the last minute, your press release just might fill that need.</li>
  <li>Schedule time on YOUR calendar for PR activities. Make an appointment with 
    yourself!</li>
  <li>Call the media contacts and introduce yourself. Offer yourself as a subject 
    matter expert. Sooner or later, they&#8217;ll likely call you when they need 
    a quote on a story ion your field.</li>
  <li>Don&#8217;t forget about blogs and social media. These days, PR online might 
    even eclipse PR offline.<a name="anchor1514773"></a> </li>

<h2>How to Interview a Social Media Marketing Firm</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/marketing/contacting-lisa-chapman/" target="_blank">Lisa 
  Chapman</a></p>
<h3> Start With Your Company&#8217;s Goals</h3>
<p>In the last post, we discussed the importance of defining and articulating 
  your company&#8217;s offline marketing goals and your social media marketing 
  goals. Together, they serve as the target by which you measure success.</p>
<p>If a social media marketing firm doesn&#8217;t first seek to understand certain 
  core fundamentals about your business and competitive environment, they are 
  likely not a good fit for you. You&#8217;re looking for a firm that understands 
  savvy, successful business as well as social media technicalities and online 
  campaign execution. That&#8217;s a tall order. So it&#8217;s important to take 
  time, interview several firms, and find the right fit for you. If you don&#8217;t 
  put in this effort upfront, you may waste a lot of time, energy and money.</p>
<h3>Example Interview Questions</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that YOU are the hiring authority. Even though you may not know 
  a lot about how social media campaigns are run, it is still the social media 
  marketing firm that must pass YOUR scrutiny. So drill the questions at them 
  and hold their feet to the fire.</p>
<p>Gather your management team together for each interview session. Many ears 
  with different areas of expertise will hear the firm&#8217;s answers in different 
  ways. Ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How will you incorporate our company goals into online strategies and social 
    media campaigns?</li>
  <li>Do you have actual client campaign examples that got measurable results 
    from your social media campaigns?</li>
  <li>How did you measure results in those campaigns?</li>
  <li>How did you determine success?</li>
  <li>Have you had experiences in which clients did NOT achieve their goals, or 
    were unhappy with their social media campaigns? Why? What would you do differently?</li>
  <li>Do you establish baseline metrics to measure progress? Give me an example 
    from a client campaign.</li>
  <li>What has been your biggest client challenge or problem, and how did you 
    solve it?</li>
  <li>What methods have you used: To identify a niche audience and grow it? To 
    engage that audience? To convert them into customers?</li>
  <li>How will you go about determining the right social media campaign to reach 
    OUR goals?</li>
  <li>How do you price your services?</li>
  <li>What if we&#8217;re not satisfied?</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend interviewing THREE firms. Ask all these questions verbatim. 
  With your management team at each interview, have each person write down all 
  the answers. After all the interviews are over, have your team pow wow to compare 
  notes and discuss preferences. A clear winner will probably emerge during your 
  discussion.</p>
<p>After all this, you will have gone up a very steep learning curve in a relatively 
  short time period. It&#8217;s well worth the investment, because social media 
  will continue to grow in importance for all companies around the globe.</p>
