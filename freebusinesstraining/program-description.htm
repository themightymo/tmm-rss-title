<h2>Results for Learners and Their Organizations</h2>

<h3>Personal and Organizational Outcomes (knowledge, skills and
abilities)</h3>

<p>Basic understanding and skills about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-directed learning and self-management (in preparation
  for completing this program)</li>
  <li>Feasibility analysis during considerations to start a business</li>
  <li>Common structures, systems, cultures and life cycles</li>
  <li>Roles and functions of chief executive officer and board
  of directors</li>
  <li>Building and operating a board of directors (in the case
  of corporations)</li>
  <li>Basic, critical skills in management and leadership in order
  to plan, organize, lead and coordinate activities in an organization</li>
  <li>Strategic analysis, planning and implementation</li>
  <li>Marketing, including market research and analysis, pricing,
  competitive analysis, production, distribution, sales and customer
  service</li>
  <li>Financial management, including basics of bookkeeping, cash
  management, financial reporting and analysis</li>
  <li>Staffing and supervising employees, including job definition,
  recruiting, hiring, performance management and personnel policies</li>
  <li>Business ethics, including practical guidelines for managing
  ethics, roles and responsibilities, codes of ethics, codes of
  conduct, policies, resolving ethical dilemmas and training of
  employees</li>
  <li>(Outcomes from each module are listed near the top of each
  module.)
</ul>

<h3>Program Outputs (tangible results)</h3>

<p>Learners in the program produce the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Job description of chief executive officer</li>
  <li>Management and leadership training plans</li>
  <li>Complete resources to equip board members</li>
  <li>Training plan and materials to train the board</li>
  <li>Strategic plan</li>
  <li>Operating budgets</li>
  <li>Product marketing analysis</li>
  <li>Public and media relations plan</li>
  <li>Sales plan</li>
  <li>Advertising and promotions plan</li>
  <li>Financial reports and analysis</li>
  <li>Customer service plan</li>
  <li>Policies for staffing and supervising employees</li>
  <li>Policies and codes to guide toward highly ethical behavior
  in the workplace</li>
  <li>Substantial cost savings from continued access to free, complete,
  online materials for personal, professional and organizational
  development</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the recurring processes that produce the above items
are at least as important -- if not more important -- than the
items themselves. This program carefully guides the learner through
those processes.</p>


<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor9975"></a>

<h2>Nature of Learners Who Will -- and Won't -- Thrive in this
Program</h2>

<h3>Who Will Thrive</h3>

<p>This highly accessible and practical program is particularly
useful for highly motivated learners who:<br />
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trust their own ability to manage and carry out their own
  learning</li>
  <li>Understand that in learning, you don't always get what you
  pay for -- but you get out what you put in</li>
  <li>Prefer practical results (along with powerful outcomes) from
  a program, e.g., results such as plans, policies and procedures,
  job descriptions, financial statements, etc.</li>
  <li>Who cannot afford to pay the rapidly increasing costs of
  tuition and materials</li>
  <li>Who are geographically remote from educational facilities</li>
  <li>Prefer to schedule and locate their own learning experiences</li>
  <li>Can see the value of self-directed, &#147;homeschooled&#148;
  learning with the support of peers in an atmosphere of trust
  and confidentiality</li>
  <li>Prefer to share ongoing ideas, materials and support among
  peers</li>
  <li>Lastly, learners will thrive in this state-of-the-art program
  if they have a sense of adventure about new experiences and the
  patience for learning new ways of doing things</li>
</ol>

<h3>Who Will Not Thrive</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best way to convey the nature of people who won't
thrive in this program is to point out certain myths about learning
that many of us have come to believe over the years. This program
will not be appealing to people who tend to believe (consciously
or unconsciously) that:<br />
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The prettier the content and materials, the more valid the
  content and materials</li>
  <li>The more expensive the program, the more learning that will
  be accomplished (the fallacy of &quot;executive-level pricing&quot;)</li>
  <li>The more books and binders in the program, the more learning
  in the program</li>
  <li>Program certification and diplomas represent guaranteed learning
  that was accomplished by participants in the program</li>
  <li>Learning occurs primarily in a classroom</li>
  <li>Educators can always manage learners' learning better than
  the learners themselves</li>
</ol>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor1447377"></a>

<h2>Program Design and Format of Learning Modules</h2>

<h3>Arrangement of Modules -- From Building Basics to Organizational
Fitness Test</h3>

<p>The program includes 10, online learning modules. Modules are
&quot;courses&quot; through which learners progress in the program.
Materials and activities for learning are tightly integrated with
each other across various modules in the program. A listing of
the learning modules is included in the section <a href="#anchor704607"
class="textlink">Catalog of Learning Modules</a> below. The section
<a href="#anchor660058" class="textlink">Links to Learning Modules</a>
directs learners through the learning modules in the order depicted
in the catalog. Note that learners can choose to complete modules
according to their own needs, as well.</p>

<h3>Learners Can Start Anywhere in the Program</h3>

<p>The program can be highly useful to learners regardless of
the order in which they go through the modules in the program.
Learning modules are arranged <i>generally</i> in the order needed
to develop an organization from the ground up. Learners who are
going through the program primarily as a form of training and
development can proceed in a sequential fashion through the <a
href="#anchor660058" class="textlink">Links to Learning Modules</a>,
and in each module address the a) topics for discussion and reflection
and the b) activities to build systems and practices.</p>

<p>Note that the activities required to build and manage a healthy
organization are usually very cyclical in nature -- for example,
product planning often produces learning that, in turn, polishes
previous strategic planning activities. Therefore, learners are
guided to revisit certain portions of various learning modules
at various points in the program.</p>

<h3>Format of Each Learning Module</h3>

<p>Learning modules (other than the first and last) have the following
format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Introduction</b> -- explains how the module fits into
  the program and the overall process of business and organization
  development</li>
  <li><b>Outcomes</b> -- lists the new knowledge, skills, practices
  and systems that learns will accomplish from completing that
  module</li>
  <li><b>Specific Materials for Review</b> -- references specific
  and free materials for review and study; these are needed to
  respond to all suggested topics for discussion and reflection
  and to the learning activities required to build basic systems
  and practices</li>
  <li><b>Specific Topics and Questions for Reflection and Discussion</b>
  -- highlights key concepts to understand about the overall topic
  of the learning module</li>
  <li><b>Specific Activities to Build Systems and Practices</b>
  -- guides the learner to develop the basic systems and practices
  to successfully build and manage the organization</li>
  <li><b>Assessments</b> -- helps the learner measure and / or
  evaluate extent of application of that topic to the learner's
  organization</li>
  <li><b>Tracking Open Action Items</b> -- guides the learner throughout
  the program to consistently record and track any incomplete action
  items remaining from the current and previous learning modules</li>
  <li><b>Reminders to Learners</b> -- some modules pose miscellaneous
  reminders for learners to ensure they're using information and
  skills from previous learning modules</li>
</ul>

<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor704607"></a>

<h2>Catalog of Learning Modules</h2>

<p>NOTE: Various modules include optional sections about boards
of directors. This applies primarily to business organizations
that are formed as corporations. These sections can be skipped
by learners who are not interested specifically in boards of directors.</p>

<h2>Cost of Program and Time to Complete It</h2>

<h3>Program Costs</h3>

<p>The cost of the program depends very much on how the learner
chooses to go through the program. If the learner chooses to go
through the program on their own (rather than, for example, as
part of a group of learners sponsored by a local service provider),
the program is entirely free. Otherwise, program costs are determined
by the local service provider who sponsors the program.</p>

<h3>Time to Complete Program</h3>

<p>Learners can go through all of the modules in the program or
they can choose their own set of modules and how those modules
will be completed. Consequently, the amount of time to complete
the program depends very much on how the learner chooses to go
through the program. The more time and energy that learners invest
in the program, the more they will learn and accomplish for their
organizations and careers.</p>

<p>Many of the learning activities in this program are activities
that organizational leaders and managers should do in the workplace
anyway to develop a healthy organization. Consequently, time to
conduct these learning activities in the program should not be
viewed only as &quot;time in the program&quot;; rather, this program
helps learners turn their organizations and careers into &quot;learning
labs&quot; where they get things done -- and learn at the same
time.</p>

<p>As a very rough estimate, learners can spend anywhere from
10-40 hours in each module -- again this amount of time depends
very much on how thorough learners are in reviewing learning materials
and conducting activities to deepen and enrich that learning.</p>

<p>Certain modules include more learning activities than others.
Therefore, the program sponsor and learners may choose to dedicate
more than one meeting for these modules. For more information,

<h2>Program Not to Be Used Primarily to Generate Profits</h2>

<p>This program was developed on a pro bono basis as a service
to the management, training and development communities. The study
materials for the program are contained in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/"
class="textlink">Free Management Library</a>, also developed as
a pro bono service. Because of the pro bono nature of the program
and its resources, the program should <b>not</b> be used primarily
to generate profits. <i>Specifically, any fees to learners to
participate in this program should be no more than the very low
costs incurred to provide and operate the program.</i></p>
