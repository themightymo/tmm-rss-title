<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>This module is useful to entrepreneurs who are thinking about
starting a business, or have already started their business and
what to understand more about what they're really doing. The module
also will be useful to practitioners/consultants who want broader
understanding about business organizations, including how they
are started. This understanding for practitioners/consultants
can help them provide more effective services to clients and establish
stronger credibility with leaders and managers in the workplace.</p>

<p>Starting an organization requires careful thought and planning.
However, you can't effectively manage an organization if you can't
effectively manage yourself. So in this module, you are first
guided through some careful examination about yourself as entrepreneur
(and you are an entrepreneur if you are starting an organization).</p>

<p>Maintaining a healthy organization requires healthy practices
in boards of directors (if applicable, for example, if your organization
is a corporation) and management. To truly understand and be effective
at these practices, it helps greatly if board members, chief executive
and employees have some basic understanding of the overall organizational
&quot;system&quot; of their organization, including its common
traits, dimensions, &quot;personality&quot; and life cycles.</p>

<p>This is not just an academic exercise. Too often, people don't
really understand the overall structures in their organization.
When problems occur, they only see the specific events, and not
the larger structures that cause the behaviors that cause the
events -- this is very important for practitioners, too. To effectively
resolve problems, you have to change the structures -- not just
react to events.</p>

<p>The importance of this understanding of organizations is evident
when you realize that many graduate business training programs
start out with an overview of the organizational system, often
in a course called, for example, &quot;Organizational Theory&quot;.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization</h2>

<p>Now you will benefit from seeing the &quot;big picture&quot;
of your organization, product or service. You need not follow
links out of the following documents, but do read the content
on each of the following pages.</p>

<p>Some readers might question why this section &quot;Understanding
Your Organization&quot; was not included before the above section
&quot;Starting Your Organization.&quot; The reason is that people
often need to start with whatever specifics they already know
about their ideas, such as the markets, customers, competitors,
financing, etc., before they start thinking about the more broad
-- even abstract -- matters in the following links. The following
links help to ground and integrate the more specific information
they generated in the above section.</p>

<h2>SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR REFLECTION
AND DISCUSSION</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to discuss the following
  questions with peers, board members, management and employees,
  as appropriate.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations About You</h2>

<p>1. What are at least 3 characteristics of successful entrepreneurs?
Are you an entrepreneur? How did you conclude that about yourself?
See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor1415624"
class="textlink">Are You Really an Entrepreneur?</a></p>

<p>2. Are your finances in shape to begin planning and starting
a new organization or business? Are you sure? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalwellness/personal-finance.htm#anchor599811"
class="textlink">Are Your Personal Finances in Shape?</a>.</p>

<p>3. How will you manage the stresses involved in planning and
starting a new organization, product or service? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor540562"
class="textlink">How Will You Manage the Stresses Involved?</a></p>

<h2>Considerations About Your Business Idea</h2>

<p>1. Is there really a need for your new organization, product
or service? How do you know? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor1793499"
class="textlink">Is There Really a Need for the Product or Service
in Your Organization?</a></p>

<p>2. What type of organization would you start, if it's a new
organization? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor909504"
class="textlink">What Type of New Organization, Product or Service
Will You Be Starting?</a></p>

<p>3. What are at least 3 of the risk involved for you? See <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor917749"
class="textlink">What Are the Risks Involved?</a></p>

<p>4. What planning and financial skills do you have? Where might
you need to improve? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor914832"
class="textlink">What Planning and Financial Skills Do You Need?</a> (This eMBA has upcoming modules about planning
and finances.)</p>

<p>5. So what is a summary of your plans for your new organization,
product or service? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor884543"
class="textlink">What Are Your Initial Plans?</a></p>

<p>6. What expertise, or human resources, will you need? How might
they be organized? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor964288"
class="textlink">What Human Resources Will Your New Organization,
Product or Service Need?</a></p>

<p>7. How much money might you need for startup? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor1057631"
class="textlink">How Much Money Will You Need?</a></p>

<p>8. Might you draft a first-draft of a basic strategic plan
or business plan now? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm#anchor1062159"
class="textlink">Write a Strategic Plan or Business Plan Document?</a> (This eMBA has upcoming modules about strategic
planning and about product and service planning.) </p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization</h2>

<p>1. What is a basic definition of an organization? What is a
mission? Vision? Values? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/definition.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Definition of Organization (which includes
some optional reading about systems thinking)</a>.</p>

<p>2. It helps a great deal to think of organizations, products
and/or services as systems, for example, when planning products
or managing major changes in your organization. What is a system?
(HINT: Think about inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes.) How
is a system different than a pile of sand? What are some common
characteristics of systems. How is an organization like a system?
(See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/definition.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Definition of Organization (which includes
some optional reading about systems thinking)</a>.</p>

<p>3. What metaphor do you prefer to describe organizations? Machines?
Organisms? Persons? Groups? Families? Others? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/metaphor.htm"
class="textlink">Various Ways to Look at Organizations</a>.</p>

<p>4. Organizations have certain dimensions and concepts in common.
When designing, organizing and/or re-organizing organizations,
it helps to be aware of these dimensions and concepts. Name at
least three of the dimensions of organizations. Name at least
three key concepts to consider when designing organizations. See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/dimensions.htm"
class="textlink">Common Dimensions in Organizations</a> and <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/concepts.htm" class="textlink">Key
Concepts in the Design of an Organization</a>.</p>

<p>5. The concept of culture is VERY important. Each organization
has its own unique culture. When managing an organization, it's
important to acknowledge what values are really important to the
organization, what behaviors typically occur and what behaviors
are really treasured. Lack of understanding about culture is one
of the major reasons that organizational change efforts fail.
Describe the concept of organizational &quot;culture&quot;. See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/culture.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Culture -- the &quot;personality&quot;
of the organization</a>.</p>

<p>6. People -- like most other systems -- go through life cycles.
When trying to understand, manage or help a system, it's very
important to you know what life cycle the system is in. This is
true for organizations as well. Organizations have life cycles.
This is often forgotten when trying to work with organizations.
Describe the concept of organizational life cycle. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/life-cycles.htm"
class="textlink">Life Cycles of Organizations</a>.</p>

<p>7. What is the &quot;new paradigm&quot;? What are several of
the changes that might be expected in this new paradigm? What
major, overall driving forces are causing this new paradigm? What
are some of the characteristics of organizations in the new paradigm?
What are some of the new structures that you might see in the
new paradigm? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/paradigms.htm"
class="textlink">Future of Organizations -- A New Paradigm?</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/new-structures.htm#anchor1279558"

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
  <li><i>The information in the subsections &quot;Understanding
  Your Organization ...&quot; is enough to give you a basic sense
  of your organization, including its structure and basic parts,
  its current (or desired) personality, and feedback among the
  basic parts. You'll soon learn a great deal more about your organization
  as you progress through the remaining modules in this program.</i></li>
  <li><i>If you are planning to start a new organization, it will
  be very helpful to obtain documents relevant to the particular
  rules and regulations to start a business in your state. Contact
  your local Secretary of State and/or Attorney General's office
  and ask what documents you need to start a business. It will
  be very helpful if you have addressed the following activities.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting Your New Organization</h2>

<p>1. Write a five- to ten-sentence description of the purpose
of your organization. This is the mission statement of your new
organization. What is the nature of your organization's products
and industry, e.g., services, manufacturing, wholesale, etc? For
assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm#anchor323314"
class="textlink">Writing/Updating a Mission Statement</a>.</p>

<p>2. If you are forming a corporation, you'll likely need a board
of directors. Find out the minimum number of people required to
be on a corporate board of directors in your state. You might
call, for example, your Attorney General's office, States Attorneys
office, etc. Recruit at least this number of people to join your
board. For assistance, see <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor579041">Overview
of Board Roles and Responsibilities</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/joining-boards.htm"
class="textlink">Joining a Board</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/recruiting-members.htm"
class="textlink">Recruiting Board Members</a>.</p>

<p>3. Recruit expertise to help you get your organization started.
A great place to start is by getting references from other small
organizations. Don't forget about finding an insurance agent.
You'll probably soon need liability and property insurance. For
assistance, see <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/index.htm#anchor3916681">Getting
a Bank and Banker</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/staffing/joining-boards.htm"
class="textlink">Joining a Board</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm#anchor904870"
class="textlink">Hiring Consultants</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/working-with-lawyers.htm"
class="textlink">Getting and Using a Lawyer</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor1442509"
class="textlink">Getting and Using Accounting Services</a>.</p>

<p>4. If you plan to form a corporation, then draft a set of Articles
of Incorporation (or whatever other type of legal charter is required,
for example, a constitution, Articles of Association, etc.). For
assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor133574"
class="textlink">Articles of Incorporation</a>.</p>

<p>5. Your board (if applicable) will probably need a set of bylaws
(bylaws specify how your board will govern the organization and
how it will be configured, for example, with a chief executive,
etc.). For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/documents/bylaws.htm"
class="textlink">Corporate Bylaws</a>.</p>

<p>6. Make a draft (probably a <i>very</i> rough draft at this
point) of a plan that includes the top 5-8 goals for the organization
to accomplish over the next year. Think about what resources are
needed to achieve these goals. (This is a <i>very</i> rough draft
of a strategic plan. We'll refine the plan later in this program.)
Write down the costs for the resources and group them in major
categories including: personnel, computers, office supplies, facilities
(rent, utilities, etc.) and any other major groups of costs. This
is a <i>very</i> rough draft of a yearly budget. You don't have
to go into great detail at this point. For assistance, see <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Guidelines for Successful Planning Process</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Description of Strategic Planning</a> and
<a href="http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/news/record/36.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How Do We Prepare a Budget?)</a></p>

<p>7. Hold a meeting of your board of directors, if applicable.
In the meeting, members should review the drafts of the Articles,
bylaws, strategic plan and budget. Members should vote to approve
the drafted items. Members should also vote to select officers.
Your state may require that boards have certain officer roles,
for example, Chair/President, Secretary and Treasurer. For assistance,
see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/meetings/general-guidlines.htm"
class="textlink">Board Meetings</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/sample-minutes.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Sample Board of Directors Meeting Minutes</a>.</p>

<p>8. Make the necessary filings for incorporation (probably to
your local Secretary of State), if you are planning a corporation.
That office can likely provide you continued guidance for legally
registering your organization.</p>

<p>9. On the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>, make note to follow
up on the following actions. <br />
a) Contact your local city hall to identify if you need permit
or license to makes sales in your locale. <br />
b) It may be useful to obtain a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D98350%2C00.html"
target="_blank" class="textlink">employer identification number</a>
at this time, so you're ready if and when you hire employees. 
You only need an EIN if you are a partnership, corporation, LLC or will be hiring employees. 
You can get this number by calling the Internal Revenue Service at 800-829-4933 or 
contacting the equivalent agency in your country. 

c) Start obtaining facilities in which to operate, whether in
your home, an office, etc. The link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/facilitiesmanagement/index.htm#anchor167419"
class="textlink">Setting Up an Office</a> may help you.<br />
d) Begin looking into computer equipment you may need. The link
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/computers/index.htm"
class="textlink">Computers, Internet &amp; Web</a> may help you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization -- A Systems View</h2>

<p>1. Diagram a logic model of your organization, including its
inputs, processes, outputs (tangible results) and outcomes (impacts
on customers/stakeholders). 
Fill in the table in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/diagramming-your-business.htm"
class="textlink">Guidelines and Framework for Designing Basic
Logic Model</a>. (Note that this systems view is sometimes
called an &quot;outcomes model&quot;, which is very useful when
trying to get a clear perspective and understanding of your organizations.)</p>

<p>2. If possible, diagram a basic systems view of the development
of each of your products in your organization, including inputs,
processes, outputs (tangible results) and optionally outcomes
(impacts/benefits on customers). Fill in the table in the 
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/diagramming-your-business.htm"
class="textlink">Guidelines and Framework for Designing Basic
Logic Model</a>. (Note that we'll soon give more
attention to products, including their design and marketing, in
an upcoming learning module.) </p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization -- Its Culture, or &quot;Personality&quot;</h2>

<p>1. Write a half-page description of the culture of your organization.
Include what values your organizations holds dear and what values
you see reflected by the behaviors in your organization. Note
that if your organization is still fairly new, you can still benefit
from this activity by describing what you'd like to see as the
&quot;personality&quot; of your organization. This activity will
be useful later on during strategic planning when writing values
statements. For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/culture.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Culture -- the &quot;personality&quot;
of the organization</a>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization -- Its Life Cycle</h2>

<p>1. Write a half-page description of the life cycle of your
organization. Is it in Birth? Youth? Midlife? Maturity? Include
what characteristics you observe that lead you to conclude that
your organization is in that life cycle. Note what life cycle
will be next for your organization. Include description of any
challenges that you might expect when you go through the next
life cycle change. For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/life-cycles.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Overview of Organizational Life Cycles</a>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Organization -- Its Communications</h2>

<p>1. In the materials for review, you learned that organizations are systems 
  and that for systems to thrive, their needs to be continued and effective feedback 
  (communications) between its major parts. What can you do to ensure effective 
  communications between the key roles in your organization, including customers, 
  board members, board committees, board chair, chief executive and employees? 
  Effective communications requires more than good intentions. What specific structures 
  can you use, for example, consider reports from management and employees, meeting 
  minutes, staff meetings, etc. For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/guidebook.htm#anchor776411"
class="textlink">Basics of Internal Communications</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/index.htm"
class="textlink">Communications (Writing)</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/index.htm"

<h2>ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<h3>Assessments for Organizations</h3>

<p>1. If you already have started your organization, then perhaps
the following organizational assessments can help you measure
the health of various aspects of your organization. If you have
not started your organization, or if you just want to understand
the nature and systems of organizations better, then the assessments
can be helpful as well -- you might give them a quick scan.<br />

Assessment Tools</a></p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<a name="anchor695302"></a>
<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
