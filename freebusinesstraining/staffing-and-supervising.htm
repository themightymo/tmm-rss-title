<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Staffing and supervision are two of the most critical functions
of a manager. Each of the functions include various other activities,
as well.</p>

<p>Very simply, staffing is:<br />
a) Deciding what human resources are needed, ideally in terms
of knowledge, skills and abilities regarding specified roles,
jobs and tasks (ideally these roles are determined on the basis
of strategic planning and are defined in terms of competencies
and/or on job descriptions)<br />
b) Recruiting the necessary human resources (sourcing, placing
ads, etc.)<br />
c) Considering outsourcing to hire outside expertise<br />
d) Screening job candidates (interviewing, testing, etc.)<br />
e) Selecting candidates (via job offers)<br />
f) Equipping new hires (via orienting, training, facilities, assignments,
etc.)</p>

<p>Very simply, supervising is overseeing the progress and productivity
of direct reports, often by:<br />
a) Mutually setting goals with direct reports<br />
b) Supporting conditions for their motivation<br />
c) Observing performance and giving feedback and other forms of
guidance<br />
d) Conducting regular performance appraisals/reviews<br />
e) Addressing performance problems<br />
f) Ensuring sufficient rewards</p>

<p>Staffing and supervising should be carried out according to
carefully designed and approved personnel policies in the workplace.</p>

<p>This module provides materials and guidelines to understand
staffing and supervision, along with setting up basic systems
and processes in the organization in order to carry out activities
in a legal and effective manner.</p>

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>1. Do you have job descriptions for all employees? Do they
include titles, qualifications, responsibilities and whom the
role reports to? Dates on the forms?</p>

<p>2. Do you have a personnel policies handbook for all employees,
and have all employees reviewed it and signed a form indicating
they'll comply with the policies? Has the board 
approved the handbook with its policies?</p>

<p>3. How do you ensure adequate and fair compensation for each
of the roles in your organization? Are your practices described
in your personnel policies?</p>

<p>4. How do you ensure your employees are oriented to your organization
when they are hired? Are these practices described in your personnel
policies?</p>

<p>5. How do you ensure that you're effectively delegating to
employees?</p>

<p>6. Do you have a written policy about how you conduct regular,
formal performance reviews? Are your practices described in your
personnel policies?</p>

<p>7. How do you ensure all management personnel are completely
familiar with personnel policies? (It's critical that they be
very familiar with the policies -- their behavior can be interpreted
as the de facto policies of the organization.)</p>

<p>8. Do you have a policy about how employees are fired? Are
your practices described in your personnel policies?</p>

<p>9. Update your organization chart with all roles and their
titles in the organization.</p>

<p>10. Make a list of any personnel policies your organization
needs and write down what you'd generally like the policies to
address and how. Discuss this with your board.</p>

<p>11. Provide your personnel handbook (and a list of any new
policies you might need) to a professional (preferably a lawyer
who is well-versed in employee law) for review, and arrange to
have all appropriate changes made as soon as possible. Arrange
board review and approval of the policies, and training to all
employees about any changes to the policies.</p>

<p>12. Draft an action plan with specific goals needed to improve
your supervisory skills. Add how you will accomplish each goal

<a name="anchor695302"></a>
<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>

<br />
<hr align="left" />

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<p>1. Are you exchanging feedback with others about what you're
learning in this program?</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you
working? Are you noticing any signs of stress? If so, what are
you doing about it?</p>

<p>6. One of the ways you might be able to tell if you're stressed
out and/or losing perspective might be whether you're tracking
details or not. Are you using the action item list referenced
above?</p>

<p>7.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Organization?"</p>
