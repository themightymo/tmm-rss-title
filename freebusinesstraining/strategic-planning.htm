<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Very simply put, strategic planning identifies where the organization
wants to be at some point in the future and how it is going to
get there. The &quot;strategic&quot; part of this planning process
is the continual attention to current changes in the organization
and its external environment, and how this affects the future
of the organization. Skills in strategic planning are critical
to the long-term success of your organization. This form of planning
includes: <br />
a) Taking a wide look around at what's going on outside the organization
and how it might affect the organization (an environmental scan),
and identifying opportunities and threats<br />
b) Taking a hard look at what's going on inside the organization,
including its strengths and weaknesses (perhaps doing a SWOT analysis)<br />
c) Establishing statements of mission, vision and values (some
prefer to do that as the first step in planning)<br />
d) Establishing goals to accomplish over the next (usually) three
years or so, as a result of what's going on inside and outside
the organization<br />
e) Identifying how those goals will be reached (strategies, objectives,
responsibilities and timelines)</p>

<p>Strategic planning determines the overall direction and goals
of the organization. Consequently, strategic planning influences
numerous aspects of the organization, including what:<br />
a) Products and services will be provided by the business and
how those products and services will be designed<br />
b) Organizational design and roles will be needed by the organization<br />
c) Performance goals should be established for positions throughout
the business<br />
d) Board committees should be developed (in the case of corporations)<br />
e) Resources will be needed to achieve those goals, and consequently,
how much money is needed to procure those resources -- ultimately,
the goals determine the content of various budgets</p>

<p>Two key points to remember while proceeding through this module
are:<br />
1) The planning process is at least as important as the planning
document itself <br />
2) The planning process is never &quot;done&quot; -- the planning
process is a continuous cycles that's part of the management process
itself</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Planning Committee (in the case of corporations) to review and
help guide implementation the information in this learning module.
The Planning Committee might be comprised of chairs from other
board committees. Major activities and goals from this learning
module could be incorporated in that Committee's <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm"
class="textlink">Committee Work Plan</a>. This module includes
additional recommendations for membership of the group of planners.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT OCCASIONAL REFERENCES TO NONPROFIT MATERIALS: Various
links below refer to nonprofit strategic planning -- there is
little difference between strategic planning in for-profit and
nonprofit organizations. Consequently, all of the materials referenced
below can be useful to understanding strategic planning in for-profit
organizations.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS USED IN THIS MODULE:
There are many different ways to do strategic planning. The process
used depends on the nature and needs of the organization, the
reason for the planning (there are numerous, different reasons
for doing strategic planning), the types of priorities faced by
the organization, the rate of change outside and inside the organization,
the ways that decisions are made in the organization, the expertise
of people to do planning, the extent of external research needed
to do the planning, and the personal preferences of the organization's
leaders and the facilitator(s) of the planning process. Because
this module is aims to explain strategic planning to people who
have no -- or very little -- experience in strategic planning,
some basic approaches are described in this module. Other approaches
are described in the Library's <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm"
class="textlink">Strategic Planning</a> topic.</p>

  <li><b>Address any hesitations that planners might have before
  you start planning.</b> Do you have any reservations or hesitations
  about the value of strategic planning? If you do not want to
  pursue the strategic planning process as it is described in this
  module, then how will you (the board, chief executive and other
  employees) decide what your organization will be doing over the
  next few years and how it will do it? (Many banks/funders, prospective
  board members and chief executives will want to see some form
  of a strategic plan document. Consider this in your decision
  about how your organization will do strategic planning.)</li>

<h3>Developing Your Basic Strategic Plan Document</h3>

<p>The following activities involve completing a Strategic Plan
document. A framework, or template, is provided for you, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>.
However, that document is in HTML, of Web-based format. You might
be better to re-create the framework, using your preferred word
-processing software.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Write Your Mission Statement.</b> In the section labeled
  &quot;Mission Statement&quot; in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write a concise description of the purpose of your organization.
  Answer the question: &quot;Why does our organization exist?&quot;
  When answering this question, include the nature of your products
  and the groups of customer who buy your products. The mission
  statement should provide continued direction and focus to your
  plans and operation in your organization. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/mission-vision-values.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Developing Mission, Vision and Values
  Statements</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Write Your Vision Statement.</b> In the section labeled
  &quot;Vision Statement&quot; in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>
  write your vision statement. Answer the question &quot;What do
  you hope for your organization and customers?&quot; Ideally,
  it should be written in a compelling, inspirational fashion.
  See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/mission-vision-values.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Developing Mission, Vision and Values
  Statements</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Write Your Values Statement.</b> In the section labeled
  &quot;Values Statement&quot; in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down the important values from which you want your organization
  to operate. The values statement depicts the priorities in how
  the organization carries out activities with stakeholders. See
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/mission-vision-values.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Developing Mission, Vision and Values
  Statements</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Conduct an External Analysis. In Appendix C</b> of the
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down your thoughts from an external analysis. An external
  analysis looks at societal, technological, political, and economic
  trends affecting the organization, e.g., trends in the economy,
  recent or pending legislation, demographic trends, rate of access
  to trained labor, and competition. In your external analysis,
  don't forget to look at stakeholders&#146; impressions of the
  organization, including bankers', customers&#146;, community
  leaders&#146;, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Conduct an Internal Analysis. In Appendix C</b> of the
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down your thoughts from your internal analysis. Write down
  the major strengths and weaknesses of your organization. Write
  down the major threats and opportunities regarding your organization.
  Consider trends affecting the organization, e.g., strength of
  sales, reputation of the organization, expertise of employees,
  facilities, strength of finances, strength of administrative
  offices and operations, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Identify Strategic Issues. In Appendix C</b> of the <a
  href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down the major immediate and near-term issues that your
  organization must address. New organizations, in particular,
  are often better off to first look at the major obstacles or
  issues that if faces, and next identify the more forward-looking,
  developmental goals to accomplish over the next few years. For
  example, current issues might be that sales are dropping, there
  is no research and development to generate new products, employee
  turnover rate is too high, etc. Developmental goals for a new
  organization might be, for example, build a board, do a strategic
  plan, do a market analysis to build a new product, hire employees,
  etc. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/issues-goals.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Identifying Strategic Issues and Goals</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Establish Strategic Goals.</b> In the section labeled
  &quot;Goals and Strategies&quot; in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down the strategic goals to address the above-identified
  issues and the more forward-looking, developmental goals. Consider
  goals over the term of your strategic plan, but look very closely
  at the next year especially. Design and word your goals to be
  &quot;SMARTER&quot;, that is, specific, measurable, acceptable
  to the people working to achieve the goals, realistic, timely,
  extending the capabilities of those working to achieve the goals
  and rewarding to them. Don't worry so much about having to specify
  goals to be <i>exactly</i> &quot;correct&quot;. Carefully consider
  whether the goals and strategies are closely aligned with your
  mission, vision and values. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/issues-goals.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Identifying Strategic Issues and Goals</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Develop Staffing Plan.</b> <b>In Appendix E</b> of the
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write a rough draft of a staffing plan. To do this, reference
  each of the strategies to reach the goals and consider what kind
  of capabilities are needed to implement the strategies. This
  might seem like a lot of guesswork, particularly if you don't
  have experience in supervision. However, don't worry so much
  about being <i>exactly</i> correct -- you will likely refine
  your staffing plan later on as you design and plan your products.
  If you are developing a new organization, you might think about
  including the following typical roles in your initial staffing
  plan (but again, consider these roles in terms of implementing
  the strategies in your plan): chief executive, administrative
  assistant and product managers for each of your major product
  goals. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/organizing-staff.htm"
  class="textlink">Organizing Staff</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Conduct Action Planning.</b> <b>In Appendix A</b> of the
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  for each strategy, write down the objectives that must be achieved
  while implementing the strategy, when the objective should be
  completed and by whom -- especially over the next year. As you
  identify who will accomplish each of the objectives, you might
  end up refining your staffing plan. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/actionplanning.htm"
  class="textlink">Basics of Action Planning.</a></li>
  <li><b>Describe the Process Used to Develop the Plan, in Appendix
  B.</b> It helps to describe the process now, so planners can
  refer to it the next time they do planning.</li>
  <li><b>Document Any Strategic Goals Assigned to the Board Committees
  and CEO in Appendix D.</b> One of the best ways to ensure that
  strategic goals are achieved is to assign them to a person or
  group of people.</li>
  <li><b>Develop an Operating Budget for Each Year in the Plan,
  for Appendix F.</b> In the table labeled &quot;Your Budget Planning&quot;
  in Appendix F of the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  list the resources you will need to achieve the goals in the
  strategic plan and what it will cost to obtain and use the resources.
  You don't have to be <i>exactly</i> accurate -- besides, you
  may end up changing your budget as you give more attention to
  product design and planning in the next learning module. You
  should do a budget for each of the years included in the span
  of time covered by your strategic plan -- but give particular
  attention to the first year of the time span.</li>
  <li><b>Specify How Implementation of Plan Will Be Monitored and
  Evaluated.</b> <b>In Appendix G</b> of the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-plan-framework.htm"
  class="textlink">Framework for a Basic Strategic Plan Document</a>,
  write down how the status of implementation will be monitored
  and evaluated. Consider, for example, weekly written status reports

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ONLINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<h3>Reminders About You</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Are you using your skills learned in previous modules? For
  example, as you using methodical approaches to problem solving
  and decision making? Are you using strong practices of meeting
  management? Are you communicating key information to others throughout
  your organization?</li>
  <li>Are you discussing topics and materials with peers, board
  members and others, as appropriate? Discussion and ongoing feedback
  are some of the best methods to really learn new information
  and materials.</li>
  <li>Are you helping others to hold you accountable to your times
  that you committed to reading and study in this program?</li>
<li>Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Organization?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reminders About Your Organization</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The results of your strategic plan should produce updates
  to a variety of aspects in your organization. Consider:<br />
  a) Are your products and services directly aligned with your
  new strategic planning goals and strategies<br />
  b) Should any job descriptions and performance goals be updated
  for personnel in your organization?<br />
  c) Should your board committees be re-organized to be more aligned
  to contribute toward achieving your new strategic goals?</li>
  <li>How are you ensuring that your whole board understands and
  contributes to achieving your strategic goals?</li>
</ol>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"
target="_blank" class="textlink">HRNET</a>, which is attended
by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
