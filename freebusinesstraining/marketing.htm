<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>There is often a great deal of misunderstanding about marketing.
People often consider marketing to be the same as advertising.
It's not. Advertising is only one part of marketing. Very simply
put, marketing is the wide range of activities involved in making
sure that you're continuing to meet the needs of your customers
and getting value in return.</p>

<p>Market analysis includes finding out what groups of customers
(or markets) exist, what their needs are, what groups of customers
you prefer to serve (target markets), what products or services
you might develop to meet their needs, how the customers prefer
to use the products and services, what your competitors are doing,
what pricing you should use and how you should distribute products
and services to customers. Results of this marketing analysis
indicates the position, or market &quot;niche&quot;, for the organization
to work from -- and to be seen as having. Marketing also includes
ongoing promotions, which can include advertising, public relations,
sales and customer service. Various methods of market research
are used to find out information about markets, target markets
and their needs, competitors, market trends, customer satisfaction
with products and services, etc.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT THE LARGE SIZE OF THIS MODULE: This module is one
of the largest in the program. The activity of marketing an organization
and its products and services is critical to the success of the
organization and its products and services -- the marketing process
is broad and sometimes quite detailed. Learners who have very
limited time schedules might proceed through this module primarily
by reviewing the learning materials and then thinking about how
they would carry out (rather than actually carrying out) the various
activities to build structures in their organization.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Marketing
Committee to review and help guide implementation of the information
in this learning module. Major activities and goals from this
learning module could be incorporated in that Committee's <a

Work Plan</a>.</p>

  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing Your Marketing Plan for Each Product/Service</h2>

<p>NOTE: This Plan should be focused on a particular product or
service, because each has its own different description, features
and benefits, customers, competitors and pricing.</p>

<h3>Describe Your Product or Service</h3>

<p>1. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write a description of the product/service. The description
should be written as if your customers are the readers. In the
description, include the specific groups of customers served by
the product/service, nature of the method(s) in the product/service
, outcomes for customers and any other benefits to them, and where
they should go next if they are interested in using the product/service.
Be careful to describe the product/service in terms of benefits
to customers, not to you. For example, address pricing, convenience,
location, quality, service, atmosphere, etc.</p>

<h3>List Your Target Market(s) for the Product/Service</h3>

<p>2. In the table in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write a brief description of the major groups of customers
who will benefit from your product/service and the major benefits
to them. Remember that the overall strategic goals of the organization
very much determine whom you want to serve. For example, strategic
goals might be to expand the overall number of customers or markets
you have now, get new customers, get more revenue from current
customers, etc. You may want to develop new services in a current
or new market, or expand current services in a current or new
market.</p>

<p>Understanding each of your product/service target markets makes
it much easier for you to ensure that your product/service remains
highly useful to each of them -- each target market tends to be
unique. Understanding your target markets helps you to focus on
where to promote your product/service, including advertising,
conducting public relations campaigns and selling your product/service.
If you've done a good job so far of market research, then identifying
the primary targets market should be fairly straightforward. However,
it is very useful to determine several additional target markets.
These additional markets are often where you should focus promotions
and additional sources of assistance and revenue. (If you struggle
to identify your target markets, the following links might help
you, including <a href="http://edwardlowe.org/erc/?ercID=6378"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How to Identify a Target Market
and Prepare a Customer Profile</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm"
class="textlink">Marketing Research</a>.)</p>

<h3>Write a Profile of Each Target Market</h3>

<p>3. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write a description of each of your target markets.
The more you know about your customers, the better you might be
at serving them. Consider, for example, their major needs, how
they prefer to have their needs met, where they are and where
they prefer to have their needs met, and demographics information
(their age ranges, family arrangement, education levels, income
levels, typical occupations, major interested, etc). Also, consider
what methods of communication they might prefer because that's
how you are more likely to be successful to communicate to them,
for example, when advertising your product/service.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Competitors</h3>

<p>4. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write results from your analysis of your competitors.
Consider the following questions: Who are your competitors for
the product/service? What customer needs are you competing to
meet? What are the similarities and differences between their
product/service and yours? What are the strengths and weaknesses
of their product/service? How do their prices compare to yours?
How are they doing overall? How do you plan to compete, for example,
offer better quality services, lower prices, more support, easier
access to services etc? For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/competitors.htm"
class="textlink">Competitive Analysis</a>.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Collaborators</h3>

<p>5. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write results from your analysis of potential collaborators.
Who are potential collaborators with your organization and specific
to the product/service? What customer needs might you collaborate
to meet? What resources might they bring and what could you bring?
What could you do next to cultivate collaboration with other organizations?
For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/alliances/index.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Alliances</a>.</p>

<h3>Pricing Analysis</h3>

<p>6. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, write results from your pricing analysis. Several major
factors influence the pricing for a product/service. Strategic
goals greatly influence pricing. For example, if the organization
really wants to get into a new market, then it might charge lower
than usual prices in order to generate more customers who buy
the service. The organization might consider changing pricing
if the demand for its products/services is very high or low. Competitor
pricing also has a great effect. If competitors are charging much
less, then the organization might do well to lower prices. Similarly,
if the competitor is charging much more, then the organization
might consider increasing its own prices. For assistance, see
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/pricing.htm"
class="textlink">Market Pricing</a>.</p>

<h3>Write Your Sales Plan</h3>

<p>7. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, fill in the sales plan. Regarding your sales planning,
consider: What target markets will be approached? What should
be your sales method for each target market, for example, who
will make initial contacts to generate leads, do follow-ups to
initial contacts, make presentations and close sales? How much
do you expect to accomplish in sales (consider terms of outputs,
such as dollars made, customers recruited, or other units of service).
For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/sales/sales.htm#anchor149040"
class="textlink">Understanding the Sales Process</a>.</p>

<h3>Write Your Advertising and Promotions Plan</h3>

<p>8. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, fill in the advertising and promotions plan. The plan
includes what target markets you want to reach, what features
and benefits you want to convey to each of them, what methods
and media you will use to convey it to them, who is responsible
to implement the methods and how much money is budgeted for this
effort. The plan includes plans for a promotional campaign, including
an advertising calendar and media plan. The goals of the plans
should depend very much on the overall goals and strategies of
the organization, and the results of the marketing analysis, including
the positioning statement.</p>

<p>When selecting methods, consider what communications methods
and media will be most effective in reaching target markets (groups
of customers) and when. What are their preferences for media and
when do they use them? (The link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm#methods"
class="textlink">Basic Methods to Get Customer Feedback</a> might
be helpful now.) Consider, for example, radio, newsletters, classifieds,
displays/signs, posters, word of mouth, press releases, direct
mail, special events, brochures, neighborhood newsletters, etc.
What media is most practical for you to use in terms of access
and affordability? (The link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/methods.htm"
class="textlink">Major Methods of Advertising and Promotion</a>
might be helpful now.)</p>

<p>For additional assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm"
class="textlink">Advertising and Promotions</a>.</p>

<h3>Conduct Your Customer Service Planning</h3>

<p>9. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, fill in the customer service plan. When considering
how you will ensure strong services to customers, consider: Are
customers very satisfied with your services? How do you know?
If not, what can you do to improve customer service? How can you
do that? What policies and procedures are needed to ensure strong
customer service. Include training in your considerations, including
to develop skills in interpersonal relations, such as questioning,
listening, handling difficult people, handling interpersonal conflicts,
negotiating. For assistance, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/customers/service.htm"
class="textlink">Customer Service</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm#methods"
class="textlink">Basic Methods to Get Feedback from Customers</a>,
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/questioning-skills.htm"
class="textlink">Questioning</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/listening-skills.htm"
class="textlink">Listening</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/interpersonal/conflict.htm"
class="textlink">Handling Interpersonal Conflict</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/interpersonal/difficult-people.htm"
class="textlink">Handling Difficult People</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/interpersonal/negotiation-skills.htm"
class="textlink">Negotiating</a>.</p>

<h3>Conduct Your Production Planning</h3>

<p>10. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, fill in section about production planning. Note that
the development and implementation of various production methods
do not have to be addressed in detail in a marketing plan -- these
topics are usually included in the operations or management planning
for the products and services. However, production should be generally
considered during the marketing analysis to ensure the eventual
detailed production planning takes into consideration the needs
of target markets and having their needs met on time. Consider:
What resources do you need to build, reproduce and provide the
product/service? How do you know? Will you have sufficient resources
into the near future? How do you know?</p>

<h3>Conduct Your Distribution Planning</h3>

<p>11. In the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing-plan.htm"
class="textlink">Framework for Basic Marketing and Promotions
Plan</a>, fill in section about distribution planning. Matters
of distribution of products/services can be critical for organizations,
especially if they are providing critically needed products/services
to specific groups of customers.</p>

<p>Carefully consider: What distribution channels should you consider,
for example, should customers come to your facility, you visit
their offices, can you provide products/services over the telephone
or Internet, etc? What resources are needed to bring together
your products/services and your target markets? What major steps
need to occur to accomplish these distribution channels? (The
link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/distribution.htm"
class="textlink">Distribution</a> may help you.)</p>

<p>Note that detailed planning about developing and maintaining
distribution channels is often included in the operations or management
plans, rather than in the marketing plan. However, the marketing
analysis should focus on selecting the methods of distribution
that best meet the needs of target markets and the organization.</p>

<h2>Updating Your Operating Budgets</h2>

<p>In an earlier module about strategic planning, you drafted
a basic operating budget. Now that you have a stronger sense of
what is needed to produce and market your products, you should
update the basic draft that you produced earlier.</p>

<h3>Draft a Budget for Each of Your Major Products/Services</h3>

<p>1. Design a budget for each of your products/services. If you
completed <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-planning.htm"
class="textlink">Module 6: Developing Your Strategic Plan</a>,
then you already have started basic budgets for each of your products/services.
Update those budgets with results from completing this module
on product design and marketing. Consider expenses of advertising
and promotions, production, distribution and customer service.
Also consider any updates to expected revenues as a result of
any changes in your pricing policy and as a result of your sales
goals in your sales plan.</p>

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<h3>Reminders About You</h3>

<p>1. Are you exchanging feedback with others about what you're
learning in this program? If not, you really should be thinking
a lot more seriously about this -- adults learn by doing something
with new information and then exchanging feedback about it.</p>

<p>2. Are you sticking to your study schedule for this program?</p>

<p>3. Are you practicing your basic skills in management and leadership,
including in problem solving and decision making, planning and
meeting management?</p>

<p>4. Are you communicating throughout your organization by using
your skills in internal communications?</p>

<p>5. Are you managing yourself? How many hours a week are you
working? Are you noticing any signs of stress? If so, what are
you doing about it?</p>

<p>6. One of the ways you might be able to tell if you're stressed
out and/or losing perspective might be whether you're tracking
details or not. Are you using the action item list referenced
above?</p>

<p>7.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view, 
as explained in the module "Starting and Understanding Your Organization?"</p>

<h3>Reminders About Your organization</h3>

<p>1. Now that you've given more thought to the design and marketing
of your products and services, go back to your strategic plan
and update the plans about products, services, staffing and action
plans.</p>

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"

by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
