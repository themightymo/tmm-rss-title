<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>New business leaders and managers have to develop at least
basic skills in financial management. Expecting others in the
organization to manage finances is clearly asking for trouble.
Basic skills in financial management start in the critical areas
of cash management and bookkeeping, which should be done according
to certain financial controls to ensure integrity in the bookkeeping
process. New leaders and managers should soon go on to learn how
to generate financial statements (from bookkeeping journals) and
analyze those statements to really understand the financial condition
of the business. Financial analysis shows the &quot;reality&quot;
of the situation of a business -- seen as such, financial management
is one of the most important practices in management. This module
will help you understand basic practices in financial management,
and build the basic systems and practices needed in a healthy
business.</p>

<p>In the case of a corporation, the board has final responsibility
for the overall financial health of the organization. Therefore,
it's critical that new corporations quickly build up the roles
of the board treasurer and board finance committee. The treasurer
and finance committee can be wonderful assets to the chief executive
when managing the finances of the organization -- however, the
chief executive should never completely ignore the finances by
leaving them for the treasurer and other board members to manage.
The board's role in ongoing governance of finances can include
ongoing review of financial reports during board meetings, approving
yearly budgets and financial statements, approving a set of fiscal
policies (guidelines for managing finances), reviewing results
of a yearly audit conducted by an outside auditor, co-signing
checks that are over certain limits and approving contracts, and
ensuring the organization conforms to relevant rules and regulations.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT LEARNING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: At first, when learning
financial management, many people might react that the learning
experience seems mostly like filling one's head with strange concepts
and processes. Typically, the learning process starts with this
experience -- it probably isn't until the learner actually enters
an accounting transaction and analyzes a financial statement that
learning about financial management seems more &quot;real&quot;.
But the learning process almost always starts by reviewing concepts
and processes. Financial management almost always tells the truth
about the situation of a business -- so the learning process is
well worth the effort.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT BOARD COMMITTEES: Consider establishing a Board
Finance Committee to review and
help guide implementation the information in this learning module.
Major activities and goals from this learning module could be
incorporated in that Committee's <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/workplans.htm"

<h2>ACTIVITIES TO BUILD SYSTEMS AND
PRACTICES</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Learners are strongly encouraged to complete the following
  activities, and share and discuss results with peers, board members,
  management and employees, as appropriate.</i></li>
  <li><i>As you proceed through the following activities, be sure
  to note any incomplete actions in the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/action-list.doc"
  class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Role of Treasurer and Board Finance Committee</h2>

<p>1. In the case of corporations, one of the greatest assets
to a chief executive can be the board treasurer and finance committee.
Do you have a board treasurer and a finance committee? If not,
make it a high priority to recruit a treasurer and organize a
board finance committee. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/Board-Finance-Committee.pdf"
class="textlink">Charter and Work Plan for Board Finance Committee</a>.</p>

<h2>Designing Operating (or Annual or Yearly) Budget</h2>

<p>1. Your operating budget depicts the revenue the organization
expects to earn. It also depicts how that revenue will be spent.
Budget development starts from strategic planning. If you completed
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/strategic-planning.htm"
class="textlink">Module 6: Developing Your Strategic Plan</a>.
then you already have designed a basic yearly operating budget.
If you completed <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/marketing.htm"
class="textlink">Module 7: Marketing Your Products</a>, then you've
updated your operating budget to include revenue and costs of
your products and services. If you have not completed these two
modules, you should review information and materials in those
modules to draft and update a basic operating budget.</p>

<p>2. Obtain authorization of the operating budget by the board
(in the case of corporations). Board members should receive copies
of the operating budget for their review and authorization in
a board meeting. The minutes of the board meeting should reflect
member's approval of the budget. Approval indicates that the board
expects the organization to operate over the coming year according
to the expected expenses and revenues depicted in the approved
operating budget. Note that if board members have been involved
in previous strategic and product/program planning, then their
approval of the budgets should be very straightforward at this
point.</p>

<h2>Building Basics of Bookkeeping and Financial Controls</h2>

<p>1. For your business, do you use a cash-basis vs. accrual-basis
accounting system? How do you know? What system should you be
using? What about for generating financial reports? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basics of Financial Management in U.S. Small
For-Profit Businesses</a>.</p>

<p>2. Will you be using a software tool to do your bookkeeping
and accounting? See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor1869247"
class="textlink">Buy Accounting Software to Help You?</a></p>

<p>3. What bookkeeping journals do you use for your business?
If you do not have journals, then start with a simple cash journal.
See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/basics.htm"
class="textlink">Basics of Financial Management in U.S. Small
For-Profit Businesses</a>.</p>

<p>4. Do you have a Chart of Accounts for your business? If you do not have one, 
  then consider an example provided in the following links. If you have selected 
  a software tool to help you manage your finances, then that tool might already 
  have a Chart of Accounts in it. See <a href="http://www.netmba.com/accounting/fin/accounts/chart/"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Chart of Accounts</a>.</p>

<p>5. What financial controls do you have in place? If you have
not yet done so, draft a set of financial controls for your organization.
Think about controls to guide signing checks, handling petty cash,
opening mail, how to verify that account totals are accurate,
etc.) (The concepts in financial controls are essentially the
same between a for-profit and nonprofit organization.) See <a
href="http://www.safe-wise.com/downloads/SampleFinancialProceduresManual-MNNPCouncil.pdf" target="_blank" class="textlink">Sample Financial Procedures Manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Credit and Collections</h2>

<p>1. Imagine that you did not get paid by a client or customer.
What would you do? Write down your answer and consider it to be
a basic draft of a financial procedure to handle collections.
See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor2018673" class="textlink">Credit and Collections</a> and
<a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/bizlettersamples/a/debtcollection.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Collection Letter Secrets to
Getting Paid</a>.</p>

<h2>Budget Deviation Analysis</h2>

<p>1. A few months after implementing your operating budget (that
includes expected expenses and revenues), modify the budget report
to include the column headings listed in your reading in the section
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor562045"
class="textlink">Budget Deviation Analysis</a>. Analyze how closely
actual expenses and revenues are matching planned expenses and
revenues. What is the percentage difference for each item or account
or line item in the report? Is that percentage difference a problem?
What caused the difference? What are you going to do about the
differences in the future? Conduct a budget deviation analysis
each month in your business.</p>

<h2>Financial Statements -- Profit and Loss (Income Statement)</h2>

<p>1. Generate an Income Statement for your business. Generating
an income statement requires that you have been entering business
financial transactions either by hand in a journal(s) or in an
accounting software package. Ideally, you have an accounting software
package that will produce a statement for you merely by entering
a command or clicking on the button on your computer screen. If
you generate a statement by hand, see examples in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor561785"
class="textlink">Profit and Loss (Income) Statements</a> to provide
direction. Do you have an operating profit or loss?</p>

<h2>Financial Statements -- Balance Sheet</h2>

<p>1. Generate a balance sheet for your business. Similar to an
income statement, generating a balance sheet requires that you
have been entering business financial transactions either by hand
in a journal(s) or in an accounting software package. Ideally,
you have an accounting software package that will produce a sheet
for you merely by entering a command or clicking on the button
on your computer screen. If you generate a sheet by hand, see
examples in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor562401"
class="textlink">Balance Sheets</a> to provide direction. Do you
have a positive or negative net worth? Calculate your current
ratio. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor563149"
class="textlink">Ratios</a>. What does your current ratio indicate
about your organization? Calculate your quick ratio. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor563149"
class="textlink">Ratios</a>. What does your quick ratio tell
your about your organization?</p>

<h2>Financial Statements -- Cash Flow</h2>

<p>1. Generate a cash flow statement for your business. A cash
flow statement can be one of the most important statements for
a new business because it can depict whether you can pay your
near-term bills or not. Generating a balance sheet requires that
you have been entering business financial transactions either
by hand in a journal(s) or in an accounting software package.
Ideally, you have an accounting software package that will produce
a sheet for you merely by entering a command or clicking on the
button on your computer screen. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessfinance/index.htm#anchor1917402"
class="textlink">Managing Cash Flow</a>.</p>

<h2>REMINDERS FOR THOSE IN THE ON-LINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</h2>

<h3>Reminders About You</h3>

<p>1. Are you using your skills learned in previous modules? For
example, as you using methodical approaches to problem solving
and decision making? Are you using strong practices of meeting
management? Are you communicating key information to others throughout
your organization?</p>

<p>2. Are you discussing topics and materials with peers, board
members and others, as appropriate? Discussion and ongoing feedback
are some of the best methods to really learn new information and
materials.</p>

<p>3. Are you helping others to hold you accountable to your times
that you committed to reading and study in this program?</p>


<p>4.  Are you reflecting on learnings from past modules and how they build on the learning 
in this module?  For example, are you seeing your organization from a systems view,

<h2>TRACKING OPEN ACTION ITEMS</h2>

<p>1. One of the first indicators that an organization or a person
is struggling is that open action items are not tracked and reviewed.
(Open action items are required actions that have not yet been
completed.) Instead, people only see and react to the latest &quot;fires&quot;
in their workplaces or their lives. Whether open action items
are critical to address now or not, they should not entirely be
forgotten. Therefore, update and regularly review a list of open
action items (identified while proceeding through this program)
that includes listing each open action item, who is responsible
to complete it, when it should be completed and any associated
comments. When updating the list, consider action items as identified
during discussions, learning activities and assessments in this
module. Share and regularly review this action item list with
the appropriate peers, board, management and employees in your
organization. You can use the following <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/action-list.doc"
class="textlink">Action Item Planning List</a>. (At that Web address,
a box might open, asking you which software application to open
the document.)</p>

<p>2. If you have questions, consider posing them in the national,
free, online discussion group <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/HRNET"

by many human resource and organization development experts.</p>
