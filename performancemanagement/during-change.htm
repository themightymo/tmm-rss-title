<p>Organizations try to manage the performance of each employee, team and process 
  and even of the organization itself. The performance management process is very 
  similar, regardless of where it is applied. Information in this topic describes 
  the general performance management process. The information is customized for 
  each application in the topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/index.htm">Employee

<h2>Performance Management During Rapid Change</h2>

<p>Today's organizations seem to change much more rapidly than
in the past. Consequently, many experts have strong reservations
about the numerous measurements that must be taken in performance
management. They assert that no sooner is a measurement identified
than the measurement becomes obsolete because the organization
has changed substantially.</p>

<p>There are numerous measurements to consider when adopting a
performance management system. However, the measurements themselves
are not the major purpose of the performance management process.
The purpose of the process is to provide a consistent frame of
reference during ongoing feedback about performance, whether the
organization is entirely stable or in the midst of rapid change.
Measurements ensure that everyone involved is working and talking
from the same script. The measurements themselves may change.
However, organization members should be able to recognize and
explain the change. This assertion is true whether one is addressing
the performance of an organization, process, subsystem or employee.</p>

<p>Consider the implications of the above assertion. The assertion
is saying, e.g., that when performance management is carried out
with an employee, filling out the performance form and having
the performance discussion is not the highlight of the performance
process -- the highlight has been occurring during the year when
the supervisor and employee exchanged ongoing feedback about performance.
Filling out the form and having the discussion are really measurements,
too. If the performance process is done well, the performance
review discussion should include absolutely no surprises for the
employee. All feedback to him or her already should have occurred.</p>

<p>Frankly, many supervisors dread having to fill out the employee
performance review forms. That is the time means they have to
recount the employee's activities during the year, try translate
the activities to areas of knowledge and skills shown by the employee
-- they have to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; what's been happening,
mostly to fill out a form. They worry that they haven't spent
sufficient time noticing the employee's behavior, that they might
be confronted and proven wrong. They often believe that the employee
has been doing just fine during the year, so why have to quit
work now just to fill out a form. They worry that the employee
may have high expectations that can't be met by the performance
process. That's how many supervisors see the process - because
the form and the various measurements that it recalls, are too
often seen as the end in themselves.</p>

<p><i>The most important part of the performance management process
is the ongoing communication around the measurements.</i></p>
