<p>Organizations try to manage the performance of each employee, team and process 
  and even of the organization itself. The performance management process is very 
  similar, regardless of where it is applied. Information in this topic describes 
  the general performance management process. The information is customized for

<p>Information in this section is generic to performance management, that is, 
  the information generally applies to any performance management effort, e.g., 
  organization, process, subsystem or employee.</p>

<a name="anchor4292910732"></a> 
<h2>Development and Contents of a Performance Plan</h2>

<p>Most of us are used to thinking of performance management focused
on the employee, rather than the organization, groups, etc. Therefore,
when first reviewing the steps to develop a performance plan,
it may be best to use the example of employee performance management
as done below. The reader should keep in mind that these steps
might be followed in performance efforts focused on the entire
organization or some subsystem of the organization.</p>

<p>In the example below, the focus -- or domain -- of the performance
management process is an employee. The employee is a machine operator;
consequently, application of performance management in this example
is rather straightforward for clarity in the example. Most applications
are not this straightforward.</p>

<p>NOTE: As review about key terms in performance management,
key terms are bolded and italicized below.</p>

<p>1. <b>Review organizational goals to associate preferred organizational
results in terms of units of performance, that is, quantity, quality,
cost or timeliness<br />
<i>Organizational goals</i></b> are often established during strategic
planning. Performance management translates these goals to <b><i>results</i></b>,
which typically are described in terms of quantity, quality, timeliness
or cost. Results are the primary products or services desired
from the focus of the performance process. Examples are a percentage
increase in sales, extent of impact on a certain community, etc.
Goals should be &quot;SMART&quot; (an acronym), that is, specific,
measurable, acceptable, realistic to achieve and time-bound with
a deadline. For example, an overall goal may be to increase the
organization's profit by 30% by the end of the next fiscal year.
An associated strategy (or sub-goal), among others, may be to
increase profit of the Catalog Department by 50% over the next
fiscal year.</p>

<p>2. <b>Specify desired results for the domain -- as guidance,
focus on results needed by other domains (e.g., to internal or
external customers)</b><br />
For example, the operator's results are high-quality, printed
images for the internal customer, the Catalog Department. This
aspect of performance management is sometimes called &quot;goal
setting&quot;, particularly when the focus of the performance
process is on employees. Goals should be &quot;SMART&quot; and
challenging.</p>

<p>3. <b>Ensure the domain's desired results directly contribute
to the organization's results<br />
<i>Aligning results with organizational results</i></b> is another
unique aspect of performance management process. Do the employee's
results directly contribute to the results of the organization?
What organizational goals? How? For example, do the prints directly
contribute to the desired profit increase of 50% of the Catalog
Department? How? Is there anything else the operator could be
doing that would be more productive for this goal? Should a job
analysis be done to verify efficiency?</p>

<p>4. <b>Weight, or prioritize, the domain's desired results</b><br />
A <b><i>weight</i></b>, or prioritization, is often in the form
of percentage-time-spent, or a numeric ranking with &quot;1&quot;
as the highest. For example, the employee's results might be weighted
as follows: <br />
a) 80% of his time over an 8-hour period, Monday through Friday
over the next fiscal year, to be spent running the machine<br />
b)10% of this time in training<br />
c)10% of this time in a Quality Circle.</p>

<p>5. <b>Identify first-level measures to evaluate if and how
well the domain's desired results were achieved<br />
<i>Measures</i></b> provide information to evaluate accomplishment
of results. Measures are usually specified in terms of quantity,
quality, timeliness or cost. For example, measures for the operator
might be the number of prints over some time interval, a certain
grade on a test during his training and attendance recorded on
attendance sheets to his Quality Circle. Identifying which measures
to take is often the toughest part of the performance management
process. You have to look at the appropriate level or domain in
the organization, its desired results, and consider what are the
most valid, reliable and practical measurements to use. With complex
and rapidly changing domains, it often helps to identify <b><i>outcome
and driver measures</i></b>, and <b><i>patterns of effects</i></b>.
More about these terms in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/guidelines.htm">Performance
Measurement</a>, which is also referenced back in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/index.htm">Basic
Overview of Performance Management</a>.)</p>

<p>6. <b>Identify more specific measures for each first-level
measure if necessary</b><br />
For example, regarding the operator's measure for operating his
machine, he may have to produce at least 500 high-quality prints
an hour for eight hours, Monday through Friday during the fiscal
year. High-quality means no smears or tears. The Director of the
Catalog Department evaluates whether the operator made this goal
or not. <br />
<br />
7. <b>Identify standards for evaluating how well the domain's
desired results were achieved<br />
<i>Standards</i></b> specify how well a result should be achieved.
For example, the operator &quot;meets expectations&quot; if the
Director of the Catalog Department agrees that the operator produced
500 high-quality prints an hour for eight hours, Monday through
Friday during the fiscal year. If he produces 600, he &quot;exceeds
expectations&quot;, 700 is &quot;superior performance&quot;, 400
is &quot;does not meet expectation&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>8. <b>Document a performance plan -- including desired results,
measures and standards</b><br />
The <b><i>performance plan</i></b> describes the domain's preferred
results, how results tie back to the organization's results, weighting
of results, how results will be measured and what standards are
used to evaluate results. Developing the plan is often the responsibility
of the head of the domain (in this example, the employee's supervisor).
However, the plan should be developed as much as possible with
participants in the domain. (Note that a performance plan is not
the same as a &quot;performance development plan&quot;, which
is mentioned later below.)</p>

<p>NOTE: Now is the best time to take stock of overall performance
plans. Does the domain have the necessary resources to achieve
preferred results, e.g., necessary funding, training, input from
other subsystems, etc? Are the standards realistic? Can the domain
realistically achieve the results within the preferred time frame?
Does everyone involved in the measures really understand how to
recognize the measures? Do they know their role in the performance
management process?</p>
