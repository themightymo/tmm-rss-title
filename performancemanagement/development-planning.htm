<h2>Development and Contents of a Development Plan</h2>

<p>As described in these previous subsections, development of
the Performance Plan typically includes the first eight steps
of the basic 14 steps in performance management. Development of
the Performance Appraisal includes steps nine through 12. Development
of the Development Plan includes steps 13 and 14. We also continue
our example of the machine operator below. At this point in our
example, the Performance Plan and Performance Appraisal have been
developed.</p>

<p>Information in this section is generic to performance management,
that is, the information generally applies to any performance
management effort, e.g., organization, process, subsystem or employee.</p>

<p>NOTE: As review about key terms in performance management,
key terms are bolded and italicized below.</p>

<p>13. <b>If performance does not meet desired performance standards,
develop or update a performance development plan to address the
performance gap*</b> (See Notes 1 and 2 below.)<br />
If performance does not meet standards, implement a <b><i>performance
development plan</i></b>. This plan clearly conveys how the conclusion
was made that there was inadequate performance, what actions are
to be taken and by whom and when, when performance will be reviewed
again and how. In our example, if the operator (or other domain)
was not performing to standards, then some forms of help (or interventions)
should be provided (in this example, coaching, mentoring, training,
more resources, etc).</p>

<p>* Note 1: Inadequate performance does not always indicate a
problem on the part of the domain. Performance standards may be
unrealistic or the domain may have insufficient resources. Similarly,
the overall strategies or the organization, or its means to achieving
its top-level goals, may be unrealistic or without sufficient
resources.</p>

<p>* Note 2: When performance management is applied to an employee
or group of employees, a development plan can be initiated in
a variety of situations, e.g.,:<br />
a.) When a performance appraisal indicates performance improvement
is needed<br />
b.) To &quot;benchmark&quot; the status of improvement so far
in a development effort<br />
c.) As part of a professional development for the employee or
group of employees, in which case there is not a performance gap
as much as an &quot;growth gap&quot;<br />
d.) As part of succession planning to help an employee be eligible
for a planned change in role in the organization, in which case
there also is not a performance gap as much as an &quot;opportunity
gap&quot;<br />
e.) To &quot;pilot&quot;, or test, the operation of a new performance
management system</p>

<p>14. <b>Repeat steps 9 to 13 until performance is acceptable,
standards are changed, the domain is replaced, management decides
to do nothing, etc.</b></p>
