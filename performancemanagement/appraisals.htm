<h2>Basic Steps in a Performance Appraisal</h2>

<p>As described in that last subsection, development of the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/performance-planning.htm">Performance 
  Plan</a> typically includes the first eight steps of the basic 14 steps in performance 
  management. The Performance Appraisal picks up from step nine. We also continue 
  our example of the machine operator. At this point in our example, the Performance 
  Plan has been developed.</p>

<p>Information in this section is generic to performance management,
that is, the information generally applies to any performance
management effort, e.g., organization, process, subsystem or employee.</p>

<p>NOTE: As review about key terms in performance management,
key terms are bolded and italicized below.</p>

<p>9. <b>Conduct ongoing observations and measurements to track
performance</b><br />
The operator's supervisor would observe the number of high-quality
prints, including staying in contact with the Director of the
Catalog Department.</p>

<p>10. <b>Exchange ongoing feedback about performance</b><br />
Feedback is information relevant to how well results are being
achieved. Useful feedback is timely, feasible and understood.
Ideally, feedback address key activities to improve or reinforce
performance. Usually, the larger the number of sources giving
feedback, the more accurate is the depiction of events. In our
example, the employee, supervisor and Director of the Catalog
Department should continue to share impressions of how well results
are being achieved. Any ideas to improve or support performance
should be implemented as appropriate. <i>This ongoing feedback
is often one of the most important aspects of performance management.</i></p>

<p>11. <b>Conduct a performance appraisal (sometimes called performance
review)</b><br />
A <b><i>performance appraisal (or review)</i></b> includes documentation
of expected results, standards of performance, progress toward
achieving of results, how well they were achieved, examples indicating
achievement, suggestions to improve performance and how those
suggestions can be followed. If the above steps in the performance
management process were followed, the performance appraisal is
usually quite straightforward to carry out. In our example, the
appraisal should include input from the employee, supervisor and
Director of the Catalog Department. The performance appraisal
should be carried out at regular intervals as performance tracking
is underway.</p>

<p>12. <b>If performance meets desired performance standards,
reward for performance</b><br />
In our example, the machine operator may be due some form of reward,
that is, recognition or compensation, e.g., letter of recognition,
promotion, letter of commendation, etc. This step in the performance
management process is often overlooked when focusing on organization-wide
performance improvement, or on a major subsystem.</p>
