<h2>On &quot;Performance&quot; in Organizations</h2>

<p>(Performance management is a relatively new concept to the
field of management. Performance management literature typically
starts out with various examinations of the term &quot;performance&quot;.
The following information describes how the term &quot;performance&quot;
in this library is used in this library.)</p>

<p>Supervisors have conducted performance appraisals for years.
Employees have attended training sessions for years. Organization
members have worked long, hard hours for centuries. Processes,
such as planning, budgeting, sales and billings have been carried
out for years in organizations. But all too often, these activities
are done mostly for the sake of doing them, not for contributing
directly to the preferred results of the organization.</p>

<p>Performance management reminds us that being busy is not the
same as producing results. It reminds us that training, strong
commitment and lots of hard work alone are not results. The major
contribution of performance management is its focus on achieving
results -- useful products and services for customers inside and
outside the organization. Performance management redirects our
efforts away from busyness toward effectiveness.</p>

<p>Recently, organizations have been faced with challenges like
never before. Increasing competition from businesses across the
world has meant that all businesses must be much more careful
about the choice of strategies to remain competitive. Everyone
(and everything) in the organization must be doing what they're
supposed to be doing to ensure strategies are implemented effectively.</p>

<p>This situation has put more focus on effectiveness, that systems and processes 
  in the organization be applied in the right way to the right things: to achieve 
  results. All of the results across the organization must continue to be aligned 
  to achieve the overall results desired by the organization for it to survive 
  and thrive. Only then it be said that the organization and its various parts 
  are really performing.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="explained.htm">story</a> that further explains what &quot;performance&quot; 
  really is in organizations. </p>

<h2>Performance Management Applies to More than Employees</h2>

<p>Typically, we think of performance in organizations, we think
on the performance of employees. However, performance management
should also be focused on: <br />
1. the organization<br />
2. departments (computer support, administration, sales, etc.)<br />
3. processes (billing, budgeting, product development, financial
management, etc.)<br />
4. programs (implementing new policies and procedures to ensure
a safe workplace; or, for a nonprofit, ongoing delivery of services
to a community)<br />
5. products or services to internal or external customers<br />
6. projects (automating the billing process, moving to a new building,
etc.)<br />
7. teams or groups organized to accomplish a result for internal
or external customers<br />
