<p>Organizations try to manage the performance of each employee, team and process 
  and even of the organization itself. The performance management process is very 
  similar, regardless of where it is applied. Information in this topic describes 
  the general performance management process. The information is customized for 
  each application in the topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/index.htm">Employee 
  Performance Management</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/index.htm">Group

<p><a name="anchor1685251"></a></p>

<h2>Domain</h2>

<p>The domain is the focus of the performance management effort,
e.g., the entire organization, a process, subsystem or an employee.
A subsystem could be, e.g., departments, programs (implementing
new policies and procedures to ensure a safe workplace; or, for
a nonprofit, ongoing delivery of services to a community), projects
(automating the billing process, moving to a new building, etc.),
or teams or groups organized to accomplish a result for an internal
or external customer. A process produces a product or service
for internal or external customers, and usually cuts across multiple
subsystems. Examples of processes are market research to identify
customer needs, product design, product development, budget development,
customer service, financial planning and management, program development,
etc. The final domain is that of employee performance management.
The term domain is not widespread across performance management
literature.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1809928"></a></p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>These are usually the final and specific outputs desired from
the domain. Results are often expressed as products or services
for an internal or external customers, but not always. They may
be in terms of financial accomplishments, impact on a community,
etc. Results are expressed in terms of cost, quality, quantity
or time.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1787027"></a></p>

<h2>Measures</h2>

<p>Measures provide specific information used to assess the extent
of accomplishment of results. Measurements are typically expressed
in terms of time, quantity, quality or cost. Results are a form
of measure.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1820460"></a></p>

<h2>Indicators</h2>

<p>Indicators are also measures. They indicate progress (or lack
of) toward a result. For example, some indicators of an employee's
progress toward achieving preferred results might be some measure
of an employee's learning (usually expressed in terms of areas
of knowledge or specific skills) and productivity (usually measured
in terms of some number of outputs per time interval). (Note that
learning and productivity alone do not guarantee accomplishment
of performance results.)</p>

<p><a name="anchor1683814"></a></p>

<h2>Organization's Preferred Goals</h2>

<p>These are usually overall accomplishments desired by an organization
and are often established during strategic planning. The level
of specificity of goals depends on the nature and needs of the
organizations. Typically, the more specific the goals, the clearer
the understanding of goals by the members of the organization.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1684381"></a></p>

<h2>Organization's Preferred Results</h2>

<p>The performance management process often includes translating
organizational goals to be in terms of results, which themselves
are described in terms of quantity, quality, timeliness or cost.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1685815"></a></p>

<h2>Aligning Results</h2>

<p>Performance management puts strong focus on ensuring that all
parts of the organization are working as efficiently and effectively
as possible toward achieving organizational results. Therefore,
the results of all parts of the organization should be aligned
with the overall preferred results of the organization. Aligning
results often includes answering questions such as &quot;Does
the domain's preferred results contribute to achieving the organization's
preferred results? How? Is there anything else that the domain
could be doing to contribute more directly to the organization's
goals?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="anchor1686243"></a></p>

<h2>Weighting Results</h2>

<p>Weighting results refers to prioritizing the domain's preferred
results, often expressed in terms of a ranking (such as 1, 2,
3, etc.), percentage-time-spent, etc.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1743309"></a></p>

<h2>Standards</h2>

<p>These specify how well a preferred result should be achieved
by the domain. For example, &quot;meets expectations&quot; or
&quot;exceeds expectations&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1743536"></a></p>

<h2>Performance Plan</h2>

<p>The plan usually includes at least the domain's preferred results,
how the results tie back to the organization's preferred results,
weighting of results, how results will be measured and what standards
are used to evaluate results.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1753683"></a></p>

<h2>Ongoing Observation, Measurements and Feedback</h2>

<p>These activities include observing the domain's activities
in terms of progress toward preferred results, comparing progress
to the preferred performance standards and then providing ongoing
feedback (useful, understood and timely information to improve
performance) to the domain.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1778703"></a></p>

<h2>Performance Appraisal (or Review)</h2>

<p>In its most basic form, performance appraisal (or review) activities
include documenting achieved results (hopefully, by also including
use of examples to clarify documentation) and indicating if standards
were met or not. The appraisal usually includes some form of a
development plan to address insufficient performance. (More about
this plan below.)</p>

<p><a name="anchor1778383"></a></p>

<h2>Rewards</h2>

<p>The performance review process usually adds information about
rewarding the employee(s) if performance met or exceeded standards.
Rewards can take many forms, e.g., merit increases, promotions,
certificates of appreciation, letters of commendation, etc.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1772602"></a></p>

<h2>Performance Gap</h2>

<p>This represents the difference in actual performance shown
as compared to the desired standard of performance. In employee
performance management efforts, this performance gap is often
described in terms of needed knowledge and skills which become
training and development goals for the employee.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1778152"></a></p>

<h2>Performance Development Plan</h2>

<p>Typically, this plan conveys how the conclusion was made that
there was inadequate performance, what actions are to be taken
and by whom and when, when performance will be reviewed again
and how. Note that a development plan for employee performance
management may be initiated for various reasons other than poor
performance. (More on this later in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/development-planning.htm">Development
Plan</a>.)</p>
