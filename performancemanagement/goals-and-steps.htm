<p>Organizations try to manage the performance of each employee, team and process 
  and even of the organization itself. The performance management process is very 
  similar, regardless of where it is applied. Information in this topic describes 
  the general performance management process. The information is customized for 
  each application in the topics <a href="http://managementhelp.org/employeeperformance/index.htm">Employee

<h2>Overall Goal</h2>

<h3>Overall Goal and Focuses of Performance Management</h3>

<p>The overall goal of performance management is to ensure that
the organization and all of its subsystems (processes, departments,
teams, employees, etc.) are working together in an optimum fashion
to achieve the results desired by the organization.</p>

 

<h3>Performance Improvement of the Organization or a Subsystem
is an Integrated Process</h3>

<p>Note that because performance management strives to optimize
results and alignment of all subsystems to achieve the overall
results of the organization, any focus of performance management
within the organization (whether on department, process, employees,
etc.) should ultimately affect overall organizational performance
management as well.</p>

 

<h3>Ongoing Activities of Performance Management</h3>

<p>Achieving the overall goal requires several ongoing activities,
including identification and prioritization of desired results,
establishing means to measure progress toward those results, setting
standards for assessing how well results were achieved, tracking
and measuring progress toward results, exchanging ongoing feedback
among those participants working to achieve results, periodically
reviewing progress, reinforcing activities that achieve results
and intervening to improve progress where needed. Note that results
themselves are also measures.</p>

<p>Note that these general activities are somewhat similar to
several other major approaches in organizations, e.g., strategic
planning, management by objectives, Total Quality Management,
etc. Performance management brings focus on overall results, measuring
results, focused and ongoing feedback about results, and development
plans to improve results. The results measurements themselves
are not the ultimate priority as much as ongoing feedback and
adjustments to meet results.</p>

<p>The steps in performance management are also similar to those
in a well-designed training process, when the process can be integrated
with the overall goals of the organization. Trainers are focusing
much more on results for performance. Many trainers with this
priority now call themselves performance consultants.</p>

<h2>Basic Steps</h2>

<p>Various authors propose various steps for performance management.
The typical performance management process includes some or all
of the following steps, whether in performance management of organizations,
subsystems, processes, etc. Note that how the steps are carried
out can vary widely, depending on the focus of the performance
efforts and who is in charge of carrying it out. For example,
an economist might identify financial results, such as return
on investment, profit rate, etc. An industrial psychologist might
identify more human-based results, such as employee productivity.</p>

<p>The following steps are described more fully in the topics
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/performance-planning.htm">Performance
Plan, </a><br />
<a class="textlink"href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/appraisals.htm">Performance
Appraisal</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/performancemanagement/development-planning.htm">Development
Plan</a>, including through use of an example application. The
steps are generally followed in sequence, but rarely followed
in exact sequence. Results from one step can be used to immediately
update or modify earlier steps. For example, the performance plan
itself may be updated as a result of lessons learned during the
ongoing observation, measurement and feedback step.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following steps occur in a wide context of many activities
geared towards performance improvement in an organization, for
example, activities such as management development, planning,
organizing and coordinating activities.</p>

<p>1. Review organizational goals to associate preferred organizational
results in terms of units of performance, that is, quantity, quality,
cost or timeliness (note that the result itself is therefore a
measure)</p>

<p>2. Specify desired results for the domain -- as guidance, focus
on results needed by other domains (e.g., products or services
need by internal or external customers)</p>

<p>3. Ensure the domain's desired results directly contribute
to the organization's results</p>

<p>4. Weight, or prioritize, the domain's desired results</p>

<p>5. Identify first-level measures to evaluate if and how well
the domain's desired results were achieved</p>

<p>6. Identify more specific measures for each first-level measure
if necessary</p>

<p>7. Identify standards for evaluating how well the desired results
were achieved (e.g., &quot;below expectations&quot;, &quot;meets
expectations&quot; and &quot;exceeds expectations&quot;)</p>

<p>8. Document a performance plan -- including desired results,
measures and standards</p>

<p>9. Conduct ongoing observations and measurements to track performance</p>

<p>10. Exchange ongoing feedback about performance</p>

<p>11. Conduct a performance appraisal (sometimes called performance
review)</p>

<p>12. If performance meets the desired performance standard,
then reward for performance (the nature of the reward depends
on the domain)</p>

<p>13. If performance does not meet the desired performance standards,
then develop or update a performance development plan to address
the performance gap* (See Notes 1 and 2)</p>

<p>14. Repeat steps 9 to 13 until performance is acceptable, standards
are changed, the domain is replaced, management decides to do
nothing, etc.</p>

<p>* Note 1: Inadequate performance does not always indicate a
problem on the part of the domain. Performance standards may be
unrealistic or the domain may have insufficient resources. Similarly,
the overall strategies or the organization, or its means to achieving
its top-level goals, may be unrealistic or without sufficient
resources.</p>

<p>* Note 2: When performance management is applied to an employee
or group of employees, a development plan can be initiated in
a variety of situations, e.g.,:<br />
a.) When a performance appraisal indicates performance improvement
is needed, that is, that there is a &quot;performance gap&quot;<br />
b.) To &quot;benchmark&quot; the status of improvement so far
in a development effort<br />
c.) As part of a professional development for the employee or
group of employees, in which case there is not a performance gap
as much as an &quot;growth gap&quot;<br />
d.) As part of succession planning to help an employee be eligible
for a planned change in role in the organization, in which case
there also is not a performance gap as much as an &quot;opportunity
gap&quot;<br />
e.) To &quot;pilot&quot;, or test, the operation of a new performance
management system</p>
