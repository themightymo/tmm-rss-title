<p>&#8220;When we know the facts about people, we know what they are. When we 
  know their stories, we know who they are.&#8221; John Quincy Adams</p>
<h3>Leadership, Systems, and Stories</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful ways to understand your leadership, and the reasons 
  you behave and lead as you do, is to understand your systemic story.</p>
<p>Out of my work over the past 25 years with individual executives, executive 
  teams, and large organizational change projects&#8211;and from my work with 
  David Kantor, one of the leading family systems therapists and systems consultants 
  in the U.S.&#8211;I have developed a powerful leadership coaching process, Creating 
  your Leadership Story. Story work helps leaders make major improvements in their 
  performance in short periods of time. Clients report that, in 2-3 hours of coaching, 
  they create significant positive changes that stay with them over the long haul.</p>
<p>Leaders who choose to do story work learn to see Events&#8211;how they respond 
  to particularly difficult leadership challenges. They come to recognize their 
  Patterns of behavior and implicit assumptions, both those that have helped them 
  create desired results and those that have gotten in their way. And, they discover 
  Structure&#8211;how Patterns are rooted in their systemic story, the story that 
  reflects how they initially learned to operate in systems.</p>
<p>Many clients describe seeing the connection between their present day leadership 
  and their deep story as transformational. They make a fundamental shift in how 
  they view themselves in the world and as leaders. But the work does not stop 
  there. They then create a new story that is aligned with the results they want 
  to create and the kind of leader they want to be; they identify new behaviors 
  and assumptions; and they practice their new approaches to produce quantum leaps 
  in their leadership effectiveness.</p>
<p>This post is the first of a series in which I will discuss what I mean by &#8220;story&#8221;, 
  why your deep story is central to how you lead, why seeing your deep story is 
  a powerful way to make desired changes in your leadership, and how you can go 
  about doing that. Also, I will review the broader context for our stories&#8212;the 
  theory underlying story work; stories in the context of our life cycle; and 
  our individual and cultural myths, where these mythic stories come from, why 
  we tell them, and what we can learn about ourselves and our world by paying 
  more attention to them.</p>
<h3>Questions to Ponder</h3>
<p>Have you ever been in the middle of a leadership situation and felt, &#8220;I&#8217;ve 
  been here before&#8221;? The content of the situation may be new, but you still 
  have an underlying &#8220;deja vu all over again&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>Have you ever experienced a tough, high-pressure situation that was important 
  for you to deal with effectively, but you felt stuck? You may have experienced 
  yourself trying the same things over and over again, each time trying a little 
  harder, and each time feeling more stuck. As in the proverbial tar baby story, 
  the harder you pushed, the more you got entangled.</p>
<p>Conversely, you have probably experienced leadership situations that came out 
  wonderfully despite huge challenges; you were successful and felt great, you 
  performed to the max, and your energy flowed naturally and organically. You 
  may or may not have known why things went so well, but you knew that they did, 
  and you knew you felt great.</p>
<p>Most often, these kinds of instances reflect your deep systemic story.</p>
<h3>What is a Systemic Story?</h3>
<p>Your systemic story is the story you have told yourself about your experience 
  in systems, particularly the first system of which you were a part. It reflects 
  how you learned to survive and operate in systems; for example, your deep story 
  reflects how you learned to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Relate to key players in your life</li>
  <li>Be successful</li>
  <li>Get noticed, or avoid getting noticed</li>
  <li>Take risks, and protect yourself</li>
  <li>Respond to authority, and exert your own authority</li>
  <li>Give and receive love</li>
</ul>
<p>At its core, your deep story is the internal narrative you have created about 
  your experience of the human condition. As such, it is central to who you are 
  as a human being and as a leader.</p>
<h3>What you can do&#8212;a first step</h3>
<p>If you want to learn to see your story and how it influences your present day 
  leadership behavior, to learn how to keep the parts of your story that serve 
  you well and change the parts that do not, start observing yourself. As a first 
  step, &#8220;stand on your own shoulder&#8221;, or &#8220;on the balcony&#8221; 
  and watch yourself doing what you do. Pay particular attention to how you handle 
  the toughest leadership challenges. Notice your thoughts, your feelings, and 
  your behavior. In our next post, you will start to learn what to do with the 
  things you have observed. Eventually, you will learn how to unleash the power 
  of your story and make your life as a leader more consistent with who you truly 
  want to be and what you deeply yearn to accomplish.</p>
