<h2><a name="really" id="really"></a>How to Really Listen to Others</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara,

<p>Listening is a critical skill for all adults to have, to learn about others. 
  Also, it is one of the most valuable tools for you to establish a strong rapport 
  with employees.<br />
  There are many books about effective listening skills. The following common 
  guidelines can help you to accomplish effective listening in the vast majority 
  of situations. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Be sure you can hear the speaker.</strong> It is surprising how 
    often people do not really listen to other people. It is just as surprising 
    how often people do not realize that they cannot even hear other people. So 
    always make this your first guideline in any situation for effective listening.</li>
  <li> <strong>Overall, attempt to listen 75% of time &#8211; speak 25% of time. 
    </strong>This is one of the most powerful guidelines. Use of the guideline 
    depends on your situation. For example, if you are making a presentation, 
    you will speak more. Otherwise, ensure that the other person speaks more than 
    you do &#8211; and listen to them. </li>
  <li><strong>Adopt a culturally compatible physical posture to show you are interested. 
    </strong>This can be a powerful means to show others that you are interested 
    in hearing them. For example, you might lean forward and maintain eye contact. 
    Whatever physical gestures you make, be sure they are compatible to the culture 
    of the speaker.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not think about what to say while you are also trying to listen 
    to the speaker</strong>. Your brain goes four times faster than a speaker&#8217;s 
    voice. Thus, your brain can easily leave the speaker behind. Instead, trust 
    that you will know how to respond to the speaker when the speaker is done.</li>
  <li><strong> Notice the other&#8217;s speaking style. </strong>Different people 
    have different speaking styles. Do they speak loud or soft? Slow or fast? 
    Are there disconnects between what they say versus what their body language 
    conveys? Some people convey the central idea first and then support it with 
    additional information. Other people provide information to lead the listener 
    to the same conclusion as the speaker. </li>
  <li><strong>Listen for the central ideas, not for all the facts. </strong>Experienced 
    leaders develop a sense for noticing the most important information conveyed 
    by their people. They hear the main themes and ideas from their employees. 
    If you notice the major ideas, then often the facts &#8220;come along&#8221; 
    with those ideas. </li>
  <li><strong>Let the speaker finish each major point that he/she wants to make.</strong> 
    Do not interrupt &#8211; offer your response when the speaker is done. If 
    you do have to interrupt, do so to ensure you are hearing the other person. 
    Interrupt tactfully. For example, put up your hand and say, &#8220;Might I 
    interrupt to ask you to clarify something?&#8221;</li>
  <li><strong> Reflect back and ask if you are hearing accurately. </strong>This 
    is also one of the most powerful guidelines. Start by asking if you can reflect 
    back, or summarize, to the other person after he/she has spoken. Then progress 
    to where you can ask the person to summarize back to you what you have just 
    said to him/her. </li>
  <li><strong>Regularly share indications that you are listening to them. </strong>Those 
    indications can be, for example, nodding your head, saying, &#8220;Yes&#8221; 
    to short points that you agree with.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn the art of supportive questioning. </strong>Coaching involves 
    the use of powerful questions to understand yours and other&#8217;s perceptions, 
    assumptions and conclusions. The coach must practice effective questioning 
    skills to really understand others. </li>
  <li><strong>Ask others to provide you feedback about your communication skills. 
    </strong>Often, people do not know what they do not know about themselves. 
    One example is the leader who prizes him/herself on strong listening skills, 
    yet regularly interrupts others when they are speaking. Another is the leader 
    who speaks only in conclusions, but does not share how he/she came to those 
    conclusions. Thus, others do not understand the leader&#8217;s rationale. 
  </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="your" id="your"></a>How to Make Sure Your Employees Really Listen 
  to You</h2>

<p>Usually, your most frequent form of communication is spoken words. As with 
  non-verbal communication, spoken communication is highly dependent on the particular 
  culture in which you are working. For example, culture can affect how people 
  speak about conflict, use humor, are honest and direct with each other, use 
  silence and use certain wording. Consider the following general guidelines, 
  which might be useful in a wide variety of cultures.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>Know the main point that you want to convey.</strong> Sometimes, 
    people begin speaking with the hope that if they talk long enough, they are 
    bound to say what they want to say. Before you speak, take the time to think 
    about the main points that you want to convey. </li>
  <li><strong>Convey one point at a time.</strong> That approach ensures that 
    the listener is more likely to continue to understand you, rather than being 
    overwhelmed with too many ideas delivered at too fast a rate. You might even 
    find that you understand your own thoughts more completely. </li>
  <li><strong>Speak too slowly, rather than too quickly. </strong>A good way to 
    practice this guideline is to speak along with a news anchor when you are 
    watching television. You will likely find that they speak much more slowly 
    than you realize. They are professionals who have learned an effective rate 
    of speaking. </li>
  <li><strong>Vary your voice</strong>. Always avoid monotone. A monotone voice 
    might convey to the listener that you are bored or controlled. It is likely 
    to lull you and/or the listener into a stupor. Varying your voice takes practice, 
    but it is well worth the effort. </li>
  <li><strong>State your conclusion before describing how you came to that conclusion. 
    </strong>Some speakers convey their recommendations or advice by conveying 
    the necessary information to lead the listener to the same conclusions as 
    the speaker&#8217;s. Instead, it is often more reliable to first state your 
    point and then explain it. </li>
  <li><strong>People speak more frequently and completely when they are comfortable.</strong> 
    Therefore, get comfortable with the person to whom you are speaking. Skills 
    in authentic expression can be useful in these situations. For example, if 
    you are uncomfortable or confused, simply say so. </li>
  <li><strong>Ask the listener to repeat the main points of what you just said 
    to them. </strong>This guideline ensures that the listener is indeed hearing 
    what you wanted to convey. Be tactful when asking the listener to repeat what 
    you said. For example, say &#8220;I want to be sure that I made sense to you 
    just now, so I would appreciate if you could tell me what you heard me say.&#8221;</li>
  <li><strong> Ask others to provide feedback about your spoken communication.</strong> 
    One of the most powerful ways to learn about yourself is to ask others for 
    feedback. Therefore, ask others about how you might improve your speaking 
    skills. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="habits" id="habits"></a>Habits to Differentiate Good From Poor Listening</h2>
<p>This information is from &quot;How to Be a Better Listener&quot; by Sherman 
  K. Okum, <i>Nation's Business</i>, August 1975, and from &quot;Building a Professional 
  Image: Improving Listening Behavior&quot; by Philip Morgan and Kent Baker, <i>Supervisory 
  Management</i>, November 1995. Only about 25 percent of listeners grasp the 
  central ideas in communications. To improve listening skills, consider the following:</p>
