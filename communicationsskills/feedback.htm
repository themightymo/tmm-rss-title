<h2><a name="feed" id="feed"></a>Feedback: Negative, Positive or Just Right? </h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/communications/about-gail-zack-anderson/" target="_blank">Gail 
  Zack Anderson</a></p>
<p>Some of us are really good at giving positive feedback. Others are really good 
  at giving negative feedback. Not many seem skilled in providing both, what I 
  call balanced feedback. Occasionally a client will tell me, &#8220;just tell 
  it like it is. Be brutally honest.&#8221; Or, &#8220;you are just being nice.&#8221; 
  This makes me wonder if my feedback is too polite, or too subtle, even though 
  I try to give it honestly and in a balanced fashion. Why? Let&#8217;s take a 
  look at what can happen when you give feedback, either too positive or too negative.</p>
<h3>Too little positive feedback.</h3>
<p>While working recently with a manager, I noticed that he tended to give mostly 
  negative feedback, and very little positive. This manager stated that he had 
  been taught that giving negative feedback would be more motivational. He also 
  thought positive feedback seemed &#8220;too soft&#8221; and unnecessary. As 
  he added: &#8220;Why should we praise people for just doing their jobs?&#8221;</p>
<p>When most or all feedback is negative, people know what you don&#8217;t like, 
  but they often have to guess at what you do like or want from them. They may 
  feel overwhelmed and discouraged by the criticism, and they may take it personally. 
  They don&#8217;t ready minds, and so are often confused about what you really 
  want. They may lose confidence, since everything they do seems wrong. In addition, 
  if the only time they hear from you is when you have a complaint, they may soon 
  begin to feel defensive, or try to avoid interactions with you.</p>
<p>That said, negative feedback has its place. To be effective it needs to be 
  specific and non-judgmental. Compare these two comments on a written report:</p>
<ol>
  <li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you turned in such shoddy work. Don&#8217;t 
    you know any better?&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;One of your conclusions was faulty and you had 3 typos on the report.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>The first comment is shaming and demotivating. I feel bad, but I don&#8217;t 
  know what I should do differently. The second comment seems deliberately unemotional, 
  so it takes the shame out of it. It also gives me specific information about 
  what I can do to improve.</p>
<h3>Too much positive feedback. </h3>
<p>If you are a big believer in positive feedback, or if you don&#8217;t want 
  to hurt people&#8217;s feelings, you may be relying too much on positive feedback 
  and fail to deliver the bad news. We have all heard about employees who received 
  glowing performance reviews right up to the day they were let go for &#8220;performance 
  issues.&#8221; Obviously, there were problems that should have been addressed. 
  If all you give is positive feedback, people can have an unrealistically high 
  view of their worth and performance levels. Because they receive unbalanced 
  feedback, they can have confidence above and beyond their actual performance 
  levels.</p>
<p>Positive reinforcement certainly has its place, and to be effective it also 
  needs to be specific and clear. Consider these two examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>&#8220;Good job. Keep it up.&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;Your report was clear, your conclusions were on target, and the writing 
    was crisp and accurate.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>The first comment may make me feel good, but I am not really sure what was 
  right about my work. It might make me feel bad because you didn&#8217;t even 
  take time to notice what I did. In other words, the easy compliment seems canned 
  and can come across as insincere. The second comment is all positive, but it 
  tells me what you valued, and clearly shows you read my report.</p>
<h3>Balanced feedback. </h3>
<p>Balanced feedback provides feedback on what is being done well as well as what 
  could be improved. The positive feedback builds confidence and reinforces the 
  &#8220;good&#8221; behavior you want to see more of. It clarifies expectations. 
  It feels good. The negative feedback is given factually and preferably with 
  suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>Consider this example of balanced feedback:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Your report was clear, your conclusions were on target, and the writing 
  was crisp and accurate. There were several typos, and for that I suggest more 
  careful proofing. And one of your conclusions wasn&#8217;t clear to me. Let&#8217;s 
  talk it over this afternoon and compare notes. Overall, great job!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you lead, coach or develop people, I suggest aiming for balanced feedback 
  that builds confidence, shows the direction you want the performance to take, 
  and highlights areas for improvement in a clear, non-punishing way. At the same 
  time, note that people react differently. Some crave the honest feedback, and 
  some crave the &#8220;feel good&#8221; aspects of positive feedback. Some remember 
  and take to heart any criticism, and some live for it. So adjust accordingly, 
  but always strive to be honest, sincere and matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>By being honest and straightforward, and by offering balanced feedback, the 
  people you influence can build skills and confidence at the same time.</p>
<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How to Share Useful &#8211; and Respectful &#8211; 
  Feedback</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Feedback to employees is information regarding their performance and also is 
  information they can act on. Feedback must be shared in a manner that is understandable 
  to them and is perceived by them as being provided in a highly respectful manner. 
  Sharing feedback involves skills in effective listening, verbal and non-verbal 
  communications, and working in multi-cultural environments. Consider the following 
  guidelines, as well. </p>
<h3>1. Be clear about what you want to say before you say it.</h3>
<p>You might have already sensed what feedback you want to convey. However, you 
  should be clear to yourself about what you want to convey and how you want to 
  convey it. </p>
<h3>2. Share your feedback in a concise and specific manner, then you can embellish. 
</h3>
<p>People often lose specificity when they speak because they say far too much, 
  rather than not enough. Or, they speak about general themes and patterns. When 
  giving feedback, first share what you saw or heard, what you want instead, and 
  how the person can achieve it. Then you can add more descriptive information 
  if necessary. </p>
<h3>3. Avoid generalizations. </h3>
<p>Avoid use of the words &#8220;all,&#8221; &#8220;never&#8221; and &#8220;always.&#8221; 
  Those words can seem extreme, lack credibility and place arbitrary limits on 
  behavior. Be more precise about quantity or proportion, if you address terms 
  of quantities, at all.</p>
<h3>4. Be descriptive rather than evaluative. </h3>
<p>Report what you are seeing, hearing or feeling. Attempt to avoid evaluative 
  words, such as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad.&#8221; It may be helpful to 
  quickly share your particular feeling, if appropriate, but do not dwell on it 
  or become emotional. </p>
<h3>5. Own the feedback. </h3>
<p>The information should be about your own perception of information, not about 
  the other&#8217;s perceptions, assumptions and motives. Use &#8216;I&#8217; 
  statements as much as possible to indicate that your impressions are your own. 
</p>
<h3>6. Be careful about giving advice. </h3>
<p>When giving feedback, it is often best to do one thing at a time &#8211; share 
  your feedback, get the person&#8217;s response to your feedback, and then, when 
  he/she is more ready to consider additional information, share your advice with 
  him/her. <br />
