<h2><a name="body" id="body"></a>Non-Verbal Communications -- Interpreting Other&#8217;s 
  Body Language</h2>
<p>Resistance, confusion, distaste and passivity all show up in the body language 
  of others, regardless of what they are saying verbally. Experienced leaders 
  have learned often to trust what they see more than what they hear. Body language 
  is always present. Too many speakers and listeners are unaware of body language. 
</p>
<p>The nature of a person&#8217;s body language is highly dependent on the person&#8217;s 
  nature. For example, some people are intent on sitting or standing upright with 
  their hands at their sides in a stance of attention and respect. Other people 
  might slouch in their chair or extend their legs, in part, to convey that they 
  feel comfortable around others in the room. </p>
<p>It is difficult to make overall conclusions about body language because it 
  is culturally dependent. However, people trust non-verbal communication more 
  than they do verbal (spoken) communication, so learn to notice non-verbal communication, 
  and be aware of your own. </p>
<h3>In general, notice: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Style of voice, for example, loud, soft, frequent, irregular.</li>
  <li> Movement of the body, for example, gestures, face, eyes.</li>
  <li> Distance, space and time between speaker and listener.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Specifically, notice: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Eye contact. In the United States, this often conveys sincerity. In other 
    cultures, though, it might convey aggressiveness or hostility. </li>
  <li>Frequent movements of the body. <br />
    Frequent movements might convey nervousness, poor listening.</li>
  <li> Openness of the body. </li>
  <li>Arms crossed may mean defensiveness, which impedes communication.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Interpreting Your Own Body Language</h3>
<p>Your body language is often the true &#8220;compass&#8221; about your impression 
  of something. For you to remain authentic, you need to be in touch with your 
  own non-verbal communication. Different people have different physical reactions 
  in different situations. Consider the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Are you moving your arms and legs a lot? If so, maybe you are afraid, frustrated 
    or confused about something.</li>
  <li> Is your mouth dry? Then maybe you are afraid of something.</li>
  <li> Is your body position closed? Are your legs and arms crossed? Perhaps you 
    feel attacked somehow?</li>
  <li> Is your brow furled? Perhaps you are confused &#8211; or you are really 
    interested in what the other has to say.</li>
  <li> Are you looking away from the others a lot? Then there is likely something 
    that is bothering you. Or, perhaps your style is to look away so you can think 
    more clearly. If that is the case, realize that others might be seeing you 
    as having poor eye contact. </li>
  <li>Is your heart racing? Perhaps you are afraid of others, or you are excited 
    about a project you are undertaking. </li>
</ol>
