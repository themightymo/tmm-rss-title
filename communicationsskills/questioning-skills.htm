<p>Skills in questioning are very useful in many applications, including interviewing, 
  coaching, designing questionnaires and interpersonal relations. They also are 
  useful in asking oneself and others various questions to help them reflect on 
  their experiences and to learn. </p>
<h2><a name="destructive" id="destructive"></a>Traits of Destructive and Traits 
  of Useful Questions</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, MBA, PhD</a></p>
<h3>Traits of Destructive Questions</h3>
<p>Before suggesting guidelines to conduct supportive questioning, it is important 
  for you to know what types of questions to avoid. Consider these guidelines: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Avoid asking questions that can be answered simply with &#8220;yes&#8221; 
    or &#8220;no.&#8221;You and your employee gain little understanding or direction 
    from such pointed questions that have such short answers. Instead, consider 
    questions that start with &#8220;What,&#8221; &#8220;How,&#8221; &#8220;When&#8221; 
    and &#8220;Where.&#8221;</li>
  <li> Avoid leading questions. Leading questions are questions that are asked 
    to lead another to a certain pre-determined conclusion or insight. Those questions 
    can be perceived by the other as manipulative and dishonest. Leading questions 
    often can be answered with &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no,&#8221; for example, 
    &#8220;You did what I suggested, right?&#8221; </li>
  <li>Avoid frequently asking questions that begin with &#8220;Why.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Those types of questions can leave others feeling defensive, as if they are 
  to be accountable to you to justify their actions. That feeling of defensiveness 
  can damage feelings of trust and openness between you and your employees. </p>
<h3>Traits of Useful Questions</h3>
<p>Consider these guidelines: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Where possible, use open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are those 
    that are not answered with &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; They generate 
    thinking and reflection on the part of the person you are coaching. They also 
    ensure that the person keeps focused in the coaching session. </li>
  <li>Focus questions on the here-and-now.The goal of coaching is to help the 
    person to go forward by changing how he/she looks at the problem, identifying 
    realistic actions to take, and learning from those actions. </li>
  <li>Ask questions to clarify what the other is saying. Clarifying questions 
    help you and the person you are coaching to understand the key point or &#8220;bottom 
    line&#8221; of what he/she is saying. They often lead to discovering the root 
    cause of issues.</li>
  <li> Ask questions about the person&#8217;s perspectives, assumptions and actions 
    . Adults can learn a great deal by closely examining their own thinking. Often, 
    they struggle because of inaccurate perceptions or assumptions. Therefore, 
    ask questions about their thinking, assumptions and beliefs about current 
    priorities. Do not ask lots of questions about other people &#8211; you cannot 
    coach people who are not with you.</li>
  <li>Ask the other person for help.It can be powerful when you show enough trust 
    and confidence in the relationship with your employee that you can ask him/her 
    for help with helping them. For example, you might ask, &#8220;What question 
    should I ask you?&#8221; or &#8220;What additional questions should I be asking 
    now?&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="power" id="power"></a>How Powerful Are Your Questions?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/personal-and-professional-coaching/contacting-pam/" target="_blank">Pam 
  Solberg-Tapper</a></p>
<p>A fundamental skill in the coach&#8217;s toolbox is the ability to ask powerful 
  questions. Powerful questions evoke clarity, introspection, lend to enhanced 
  creativity and help provide solutions. Questions are powerful when they have 
  an impact on the client which causes them to think.</p>
<p>These provocative queries spark &#8220;epiphanies&#8221; or &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; 
  moments within the client which can radically shift their course of action or 
  point of view.</p>
<p>Learning to ask powerful questions will help you augment your personal and 
  business communication. The most effective powerful questions begin with &#8220;What&#8221; 
  or &#8220;How&#8221;, are short and to the point. When questioning, be genuinely 
  curious about the person you are speaking to.</p>
<p>Here are some powerful questions that can help you be more effective in many 
  situations.</p>
<ol>
  <li> What do you want?</li>
  <li>What will that give you?</li>
  <li>What is important about that?</li>
  <li>What is holding you back?</li>
  <li>What if you do nothing?</li>
  <li>What is this costing you?</li>
  <li>How much control do you have in this situation?</li>
  <li>What do you need to say &#8220;no&#8221; to?</li>
  <li>How can you make this easy?</li>
  <li>What options do you have?</li>
  <li>What will you do? By when?</li>
  <li>What support do you need to assure success?</li>
  <li>How will you know you have been successful?</li>
  <li>What are you learning from this?</li>
</ol>

</p><h2>Traits of Strategic Questions</h2>
<p>A strategic question (from &quot;Strategic Questioning&quot; by Peavey, in 
  <i>In Context, No. 40)</i>: <br />
  1. <i>Creates motion --</i> Gears to &quot;How can we move?&quot; <br />
  2. <i>Creates options</i> -- Instead of &quot;Why don't you ..?&quot;, asks 
  &quot;Where would you ...?&quot; <br />
  3. <i>Digs deeper</i> -- &quot;What needs to be changed?&quot; &quot;What is 
  the meaning of this?&quot; <br />
  4. <i>Avoids &quot;why.</i>&quot; <br />
  5. <i>Avoids &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;</i> questions -- These leave 
  the presenter in a passive or uncreative state. <br />
  6. <i>Empowers --</i> &quot;What would you like to do?&quot; <br />
  7. <i>Asks the unaskable questions</i>.</p>
