<h2><a name="iq" id="iq"></a>What's Your Communication IQ?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<p>Communication, which occupies approximately 70% of our waking hours, is what 
  many leaders find the most frustrating.</p>
<p>Many of us were never taught to communicate in ways that lead to positive outcomes. 
  Rather, we tend to experience annoyance, anger or just give up on the person 
  or the situation. Here's how to communicate better to get better outcomes.</p>
<h3>Take a Quick Communication Quiz.</h3>
<p>Think of a recent important conversation How many of these questions can you 
  answer YES to?</p>
<ol>
  <li> Did I prepare ahead of time for this conversation?</li>
  <li>Did I think about what's the best way to approach this person?</li>
  <li>Was I aware of the other person's communication style and spoke to it?</li>
  <li>Did I pay full attention, without multitasking, to what the other person 
    was saying?</li>
  <li>Was the intent of my communication to discuss and understand rather than 
    be right?</li>
  <li>Did I listen, without interruption, to the other person's point of view 
    even if I didn't agree?</li>
  <li>If I was asking the person to take a specific action, did I make my request 
    clear and concise?</li>
  <li>Did I summarize what I thought I heard the other person say before expressing 
    my point of view?</li>
  <li>Did I follow-up to see if the conversation was successful – it led to a 
    positive outcome for the other?</li>
  <li>If the outcome did not meet my expectations, did I reflect on how to better 
    communicate with that particular person?</li>
</ol>
<h3>What’s Your Communication IQ?</h3>
<p><strong>8-10 Yeses</strong> indicate you’re the tops. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong>4-7 Yeses</strong> is OK. Brush up in certain areas.</p>
<p><strong>0-3 Yeses</strong>. You have work to do.</p>
<h3>To Raise Your Communication IQ:</h3>
<h4>1. Talk less, hear more.</h4>
<p>We want to be heard and listened to but we don't always concentrate on listening 
  to others. We focus more on our agenda than on the other person’s concerns or 
  issues.</p>
<h4>2. Don’t shoot the messenger.</h4>
<p>We want to understand but our ability is tainted by our perceptions of the 
  person speaking or the outcome we are looking for. So, we often pass judgment 
  on the speaker and disregard the message. Concentrate on the message not the 
  messenger.</p>
<h4>3. Avoid mind reading.</h4>
<p>We want some kind of action or response from another person. However, we don’t 
  let them know what we really want or how to achieve it. Before assuming the 
  other knows what you want, first inform and then ask for feedback.</p>
<h4>4. Stop pushing.</h4>
<p>We want agreement from others, so much so, that we often become consumed with 
  being right or proving our point. Rather, look for areas of mutual agreement. 
  Then work from there to create a greater outcome.</p>
<h4>Career Success Tip</h4>
<p>Steven Covey, author of Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, says; &quot;Seek 
  first to understand, then to be understood.&quot; Therefore, in your communication, 
  make sure to understand others before you start trying to be understood.</p>
<p>Are there situations in which you need to raise your communication IQ? What 
  do you need to do to get better outcomes? How will you know that you have been 
  successful?</p>
<h2><a name="tools" id="tools"></a>Communications Tools to Use With Employees</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara</a></p>
<p>Effective communication is the “life's blood” of an organization. Organizations 
  that are highly successful have strong systems of communication. One of the 
  first signs that an organization is struggling is that communications have broken 
  down. The following guidelines are basic in nature, but comprise the critical 
  fundamentals for ensuring strong ongoing, internal communications. </p>
<h3>1. Each employee writes a one-page weekly status report to his/her supervisor. 
</h3>
<p>These reports may seem a tedious task, but they are precious in ensuring that 
  the employee and supervisor have mutual understanding of what is going on. The 
  reports also come in very handy for planning purposes. They make otherwise harried 
  employees stand back and reflect on what they are doing. In the dated report, 
  include a description of: </p>
<ol>
  <li>What tasks were done last week.</li>
  <li>What tasks are planned next week.</li>
  <li>Any current highlights, trends or issues regarding your activities. </li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Chief Executive Officer conducts employee-wide meetings.</h3>
<p>Employees greatly appreciate that the CEO finds time to talk to them, and the 
  opportunity to meet their CEO in person.</p>
<ol>
  <li>For clarity, focus and morale, be sure to use agendas and ensure follow-up 
    minutes. </li>
  <li>Mention any significant events for employees, for example, birthdays. </li>
  <li>Review the overall condition of the organization. </li>
  <li>Consider conducting “in service” training about the organization where employees 
    take turns describing their roles to the rest of the employees. </li>
  <li>Consider bringing in a customer to tell his/her story of how the organization 
    helped them. </li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Each supervisor conducts meetings with all employees together. </h3>
<p>Have these meetings even if there is not a specific problem to solve – just 
  make them shorter. Holding meetings only when there are problems to solve cultivates 
  a crisis-oriented environment where managers believe their only job is to solve 
  problems.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare for these meetings by reviewing the employee’s weekly status report.</li>
  <li>For clarity, focus and morale, be sure to use agendas, take minutes and 
    ensure follow-up minutes. </li>
  <li>Facilitate the meetings to support exchange of ideas and questions. </li>
  <li>Use these meetings for each person to briefly give an overview of what they 
    are <br />
    doing that week. If the meeting includes 10 people or less, then have each 
    person<br />
    give a one-minute description of what they did last week and plan to do next 
    week. </li>
  <li>Have each person bring his/her calendar to ensure the scheduling of future 
    meetings accommodates everyone’s calendar. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Each supervisor conducts one-on-one, monthly meetings with each employee. 
</h3>
<p>This ultimately produces more efficient time management and supervision. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Review overall status of work activities.</li>
  <li>Hear status from both the supervisor and the employee.</li>
  <li>Exchange feedback and answer any questions about current products and services.</li>
  <li>Discuss career planning, training plans, performance review plans, etc. 
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Use memos.</h3>
<p>It is much more effective if important day-to-day information is written to 
  people rather than said to people. Use of memos, or even e-mail messages, is 
  ideal in these situations. In your memos or e-mail messages, include: </p>
<ol>
  <li>“Subject” line, with a phrase describing the topic of the memo.</li>
  <li>“To” and “From” lines.</li>
  <li>“Date.”</li>
  <li>“Summary” describing the highlights in a paragraph near the top of the memo.</li>
  <li>“Action” specifying what you want the recipients to do with the information 
    in the memo, for example: to respond, to take note, to starting doing something 
    or to stop doing something. </li>
  <li>“Signature” line, that includes the signature of who wrote the memo.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Every employee gets an Employee Manual.</h3>
<p>The Employee Manual includes all of the up-to-date personnel policies of the 
  organization. </p>
