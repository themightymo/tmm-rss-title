<h1>Organizational Sustainability</h1>

<p>Organizational sustainability is often misunderstood to mean primarily financial 
  sustainability. That misconception occurs because, when an organization becomes 
  unsustainable, the symptoms of that problem show up in the finances. However, 
  organizational sustainability -- or the surviving or even thriving of an organization 
  -- depends on much more than effectively managing the organization's finances. 
  Just like the sustainability of individuals and families, there are many complex 
  and dynamic dimensions that must be sustainable in organizations, as well. However, 
  in an organization, there are some primary dimensions that, if they are managed 
  well, will ensure the sustainability of the organization.</p>

<h2>Primary Dimensions of Organizational
Sustainability</h2>

<h3>1. Strategic Sustainability -- Ensure Realistic Vision and
Goals</h3>

<p>If an organization is trying to do far too much, it will likely
not have enough resources, including not enough money to do what
it wants to do. One of the most important considerations to have
a realistic vision and goals for the organization. If these are
not realistic, then many of the other activities in the organization
will not be realistic, as well. The solution is not to keep trying
to get more money.</p>

<h3>2. Product and Program Sustainability -- Ensure High-Quality
Products, Services and Programs</h3>

<p>If your organization does not have high-quality products, services
and programs, then customers' and clients' participation will
eventually decline as will funding. That's why it's so important
to do a few things very well, rather than a lot of things not
so well. The solution is not to keep trying to get more money
to offset deficits. The solution is to pick which products, services
and programs you can do very well, do them -- and keep proving
your strong results.</p>

<h3>3. Personnel Sustainability -- Ensure Personnel Can Effectively
and Reliably Perform</h3>

<p>If your personnel do not fully understand their jobs or are
not resourced to do their jobs, then your products, services and
programs will be not be as effective as they could be. As a result,
you'll make less money than you expected or the money you do make
will not generate as much profit. Be sure personnel are fully
trained and supervised well. Also be sure that, if a member of
the organization cannot do his/her job, that someone else can
do that job in a timely fashion.</p>

<h3>4. Financial Sustainability -- Conduct Financial Reserve and
Contingency Planning</h3>

<p>If the above 3 dimensions are not effectively addressed, then
symptoms show up in the finances when there's not enough money.
However, there are two financial practices you should be doing
regardless of whether you have enough money or not, and they include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Achieving a financial reserve -- obviously this is done over
  time and before a financial crises occurs.</li>
  <li>Doing contingency planning -- plan for what will happen if
  you get 10% less money than planned for the upcoming year and
  for what will happen if you get 30% less.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following sections and links will help you address the
above dimensions for your for-profit, nonprofit or government
agency.</p>
