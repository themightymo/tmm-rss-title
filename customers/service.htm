<h1>How to Ensure Strong Customer Service and Customer Satisfaction</h1>

<p>(Note that
nonprofits might use the term &quot;clients&quot; rather than
&quot;customers&quot;)</p>

<p>Increasing competition (whether for-profit or nonprofit) is
forcing businesses to pay much more attention to satisfying customers,
including by providing strong customer service. It may help the
reader to notice the role of customer service in the overall context
of product or service development and management. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/index.htm"

<h2>Customer Service Basics</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/customer-service/about-barb-lyon/" target="_blank">Barb 
  Lyon</a></p>
<p>Servicing a customer is a part of every purchase and interaction with internal 
  and external contacts. It can last a few seconds up to hours. So if we all do 
  it and experience it everyday in almost everything we do, why isn&#8217;t good 
  customer service the norm?</p>
<p>We all have stories about when we were treated exceptionally well or extremely 
  poorly. We tend to share these extraordinary stories with others. We all know 
  that word of mouth marketing can be the absolute best advantage, or the worst 
  drawback for a company.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett said it best: &#8220;It takes 20 years to build a reputation 
  and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you&#8217;ll do things 
  differently. &#8220;</p>
<h3>A few basic rules about customer service:</h3>
<p>Honesty is the Best Policy. Integrity &#8211; Be honest and own up to your 
  mistakes. Communicate what you plan to do to change or prevent the same mistake 
  from happening again. Don&#8217;t be fooled into believing that a regular &#8216;mea 
  culpa&#8217; will get you off the hook. At some point the plan to fix the problem 
  must take effect!</p>
<p><strong>Break Glass in Case of Fire. Response Time</strong> &#8211; The best 
  tact is to quickly get on the phone with the customer to explain your company&#8217;s 
  mistake. Don&#8217;t rely on email for this communication if it can be done 
  quickly one on one. If you are communicating to a large customer base then email 
  is certainly the fastest and most effective way to quickly notify your customers 
  that you are aware of the problem. Frequent updates is there is a protracted 
  issue and a brief overview of how you will prevent it from happening in the 
  future will give your customers confidence that you are aware of the customer 
  impact.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping it Real. Set a Realistic Expectation</strong> &#8211; Customers 
  who have been promised something that isn&#8217;t delivered as promised are 
  far more frustrated and disappointed than if they are notified at the outset 
  they won&#8217;t have it sooner than later. In other words, under promise and 
  over deliver is the best policy. This may take some arm wrestling with other 
  departments who want to take a feature or product to market before it is ready. 
  Set the expectations correctly internally as to what the fallout may be so everyone 
  understands the impact to customer satisfaction and ultimately customer retention.</p>
<p><strong>R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</strong> Everyone in your company should love your customers. 
  Without them, you have no company. This doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t have 
  difficult customers who will push the limits and try everyone&#8217;s patience. 
  But if you don&#8217;t have a company philosophy to respect and appreciate your 
  customers, the opposite tone will infect customer interactions from all departments. 
  All departments, customer facing or not, should care about customer satisfaction.</p>
<p> From Gandhi, &#8220;We must become the change we want to see in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Use these 4 tenets as the foundation for your customer service mission. What 
  do you do to ensure your customers are treated as your most important asset?</p>

<h2><a name="feedback" id="feedback"></a>Top Five Customer Service Metrics</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/customer-service/about-barb-lyon/" target="_blank">Barb 
  Lyon</a></p>
<p>First question you should ask yourself&#8230;How do you measure customer satisfaction?</p>
<p>If you are measuring by the # of complaints you are or are not receiving, you 
  are in trouble. Not everybody bothers to take the time to tell you about his/her 
  horrible experience. If you are asking your customers if they are satisfied, 
  you are telling them that their satisfaction matters.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to ask: post-purchase and post-support surveys, 
  enclosures in the monthly invoice, follow-up phone calls and quarterly or annual 
  surveys. The right method depends on your business and your customer base. Try 
  different ways. Just do it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: if you&#8217;re not measuring any part of your service 
  delivery, you are missing a huge opportunity to improve, grow or even save your 
  business during these scrutinizing, tight economic times.</p>
<p>The challenge with specifying key indicators is that not all businesses will 
  use the same metrics. For example, a retail or fulfillment organization will 
  have decidedly different key performance indicators than a software-as-a-service 
  company.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, I have highlighted relatively general 
  metrics and incorporated a few varying perspectives for different use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Service Level </strong>&#8211; For call centers, support, and service 
  desks, first call resolution is the Holy Grail. For a shipping operation, product 
  delivery and project implementation, on-time performance is the measuring stick. 
  In a high transaction business, the first interaction with a customer will be 
  a key determinant of whether the customer will return. Don&#8217;t underestimate 
  the importance of timeliness and thoroughness.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Retention</strong> &#8211; For SaaS businesses, Utilization 
  is the best indicator of a customer&#8217;s dedication to your service. Use 
  this metric to understand who is at risk at contract renewal time. Monitoring 
  Repeat Business is going to help non-SaaS businesses understand how sticky their 
  product or service is for their customer base. You should know which customers 
  are using or buying different parts of your business. These customers who buy 
  throughout your offerings are perhaps your most important customers to focus 
  on for your retention strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Response time</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;d be surprised how many customer 
  surveys come back with comments such as &#8220;your service is great, you got 
  back to me right away&#8230;.&#8221; &#8220;I was surprised with how quickly 
  you responded to my inquiry and it made all the difference even if I didn&#8217;t 
  get the answer I was hoping for&#8230;&#8221; In today&#8217;s world of electronic 
  relationship management, response time is one of the only ways we can communicate 
  our sense of urgency and concern for our customers and their experience with 
  our product or service. What is your Response goal &#8211; within X hours? Set 
  one and achieve it. You should know what your competition is doing and beat 
  their goal.</p>
<p>Want to really blow away a customer and cement your relationship? Pick up the 
  phone and give them a personal call.</p>
<p><strong>Time with the Customer</strong> &#8211; Are your customer-facing employees 
  incentivized to keep calls short or to move too quickly from customer to customer? 
  If so, you are sending the wrong message and subsequently affecting the quality 
  of the customer interaction. There is a definite happy medium between the overly 
  chatty service provider and the thorough and efficient provider. Set your benchmarks 
  for call duration and general time with the customer in relation to the ultimate 
  goal of first call resolution, NOT the other way around.</p>
<p>In other words, a completely satisfied customer not requiring a follow-up call 
  or visit is much preferred over a quick, unresolved interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Churn </strong>&#8211; Cancellations and returns are the equivalent 
  to churn. If you don&#8217;t know how much business you are losing, you won&#8217;t 
  be able to understand how much new business you will require to stay out of 
  the red. As important as knowing how much, is understanding WHY you are losing 
  customers. Take it to the next level and use follow-up surveys, phone calls, 
  personalized &#8216;how can we get you back&#8217; emails. This survey information 
  is the real business insight for understanding your lost business.</p>
<p>By all means this is not a comprehensive list of key performance indicators. 
  To expand further we would need to focus on a particular business model to provide 
  a more granular perspective. Start measuring and start making changes. Continue 
  to evolve your key metrics as your business evolves. Keep this process circular 
  for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Post these key performance indicators in your facility or on your intranet 
  and regularly communicate them to your employee base to give everyone in your 
  Company sensitivity to how you are performing for your most important asset: 
  your Customers.</p>

<h2><a name="know" id="know"></a>Satisfied Customers &#8211; Do You Know if Yours 
  Are?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/customer-service/about-barb-lyon/" target="_blank">Barb 
  Lyon</a></p>
<p>In our world of customer service, it is our mission to keep customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a privilege to serve you&#8221;, that is what the Banker told 
  me today when I called for information regarding refinancing. Do your employees 
  believe that serving your clients is a privilege? Do your clients feel like 
  they are appreciated?</p>
<p>Nowadays a lot of consumer product and service companies are asking for feedback. 
  Some companies incorporate the &#8216;how are we doing&#8217; insight as a deep 
  part of their company culture. Salesforce.com has a place for employees and 
  customers alike to log their feedback. In &#8220;Behind the Cloud&#8221;, http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Cloud-Salesforce-com-, 
  Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff explains how and why they spent money to build 
  their IdeaExchange forum. Many e-commerce sites ask at the end of a sale for 
  feedback about the shopping experience. Brick and Mortar stores are now enticing 
  shoppers to log in and provide feedback on their shopping experience in exchange 
  for a &#8216;prize&#8217;.</p>
<p>What about the business-to-business companies? With customers locked into contracts, 
  the same drive to listen and improve is not always as entrenched into the company 
  culture. We can change that. Start by listening.</p>
<h3>Customer Surveys</h3>
<p>There are several easy-to-use, cost-effective online survey solutions now to 
  help you launch a Listening Campaign. Polaris Marketing provides you with some 
  sample questions if you are new at this. Survey Monkey, Question Pro, and Zoomerang 
  are just a few online resources that will not only help you with the logistics 
  of doing a survey but also help you formulate a strategy so you get the answers 
  you need.</p>
<p>Online Surveys are not the only option. Make calls to a % of your client base 
  every quarter or send out a brief survey with your monthly invoice. Depending 
  on your product or service, this simple effort may be a huge differentiation 
  for you.</p>
<p>Make sure your survey will give you actionable feedback. In other words, ask 
  questions that will give you answers about specific experiences as your customer 
  so you will know what to fix. General questions like &#8220; Are you happy with 
  your experience in working with us&#8221; give you a good indication of how 
  your customers are feeling, but if they answer in a negative way you won&#8217;t 
  know what part of the experience needs fixing.</p>
<h3>Action Plans</h3>
<p>Once you are ready to rollout a survey, you still have much more work to do. 
  The most important element in asking for feedback is deciding what you are going 
  to do about what the surveys say. Don&#8217;t bother asking if you don&#8217;t 
  intend to allocate the time, resources or money to making changes.</p>
<p>Now it is time to put the feedback into actionable &#8211; who, by when and 
  how &#8211; plans to make changes. You won&#8217;t be able to fix everything 
  at once, but it is important for both your employees and your customers to see 
  real change as a result of the surveys. Be realistic about what you can accomplish 
  and set both short-term and long-term goals.</p>
<h3>And Repeat</h3>
<p>Now that you have launched your Listening Campaign, you will have the process 
  for next time all mapped out. Quarterly? Semi-Annually? Annually? Whatever timeline 
  works best for you and your business to ensure the feedback is put to use.</p>
