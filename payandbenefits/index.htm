<h2><a name="benefits" id="benefits"></a>Employee Benefits</h2>
<p>Employee benefits typically refers to retirement plans, health life insurance, 
  life insurance, disability insurance, vacation, employee stock ownership plans, 
  etc. Benefits are increasingly expensive for businesses to provide to employees, 
  so the range and options of benefits are changing rapidly to include, for example, 
  flexible benefit plans.</p>
<p>Benefits are forms of value, other than payment, that are provided to the employee 
  in return for their contribution to the organization, that is, for doing their 
  job. Some benefits, such as unemployment and worker's compensation, are federally 
  required. (Worker's compensation is really a worker's right, rather than a benefit.)</p>
<p>Prominent examples of benefits are insurance (medical, life, dental, disability, 
  unemployment and worker's compensation), vacation pay, holiday pay, and maternity 
  leave, contribution to retirement (pension pay), profit sharing, stock options, 
  and bonuses. (Some people would consider profit sharing, stock options and bonuses 
  as forms of compensation.)</p>
<p>You might think of benefits as being tangible or intangible. The benefits listed 
  previously are tangible benefits. Intangible benefits are less direct, for example, 
  appreciation from a boss, likelihood for promotion, nice office, etc. People 
  sometimes talk of fringe benefits, usually referring to tangible benefits, but 
  sometimes meaning both kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>You might also think of benefits as company-paid and employee-paid. While the 
  company usually pays for most types of benefits (holiday pay, vacation pay, 
  etc.), some benefits, such as medical insurance, are often paid, at least in 
  part, by employees because of the high costs of medical insurance.</p>

<h2><a name="comp" id="comp"></a>Employee Compensation</h2>

<p>Compensation includes topics in regard to wage and/or salary programs and structures, 
  for example, salary ranges for job descriptions, merit-based programs, bonus-based 
  programs, commission-based programs, etc. (Also see the Related Info (including 
  Benefits).)</p>
<p>Compensation is payment to an employee in return for their contribution to 
  the organization, that is, for doing their job. The most common forms of compensation 
  are wages, salaries and tips.</p>
<p>Compensation is usually provided as base pay and/or variable pay. Base pay 
  is based on the role in the organization and the market for the expertise required 
  to conduct that role. Variable pay is based on the performance of the person 
  in that role, for example, for how well that person achieved his or her goals 
  for the year. Incentive plans, for example, bonus plans, are a form of variable 
  pay. (Some people might consider bonuses as a benefit, rather than a form of 
  compensation.) Some programs include a base pay and a variable pay.</p>
<p>Organizations usually associate compensation/pay ranges with job descriptions 
  in the organization. The ranges include the minimum and the maximum amount of 
  money that can be earned per year in that role.</p>
<p>Employees have certain monies withheld from their payroll checks, usually including 
  federal income tax, state income tax, FICA (social security) contributions, 
  and employee contributions to the costs of certain benefits (often medical insurance 
  and retirement).</p>
<h4><b>Exempt and Non-Exempt</b></h4>
<p>Jobs in organizations have two classifications, exempt and non-exempt.</p>
<p>Professional, management and other types of skilled jobs are classified as 
  exempt. Exempt jobs get a salary, that is, a fixed amount of money per time 
  interval, usually a fixed amount per month. It's not uncommon for exempt positions 
  to receive higher compensation and benefits than non-exempt jobs, although non-exempt 
  jobs often can make more money than exempt jobs simply by working more hours.</p>
<p>Unskilled or entry-level jobs are usually classified as non-exempt. Non-exempt 
  jobs usually get a wage, or an amount of money per hour. Non-exempt jobs also 
  get paid over-time, that is, extra pay for hours worked over 40 hours a week 
  or on certain days of the week or on holidays.</p>
<p>Each job must have the same pay range for anyone performing that job, that 
  is, one person can't have a higher maximum pay than someone else doing that 
  same job.</p>

<h2><a name="surveys" id="surveys"></a>Salary Surveys</h2>
<p>It is extremely useful to reference salary surveys when determining salaries. 
  The surveys lend tremendous credibility and fairness to the process of determining 
  compensation. Be sure that surveys are somewhat current. Reference them to find 
  the salaries for the job roles that are the closest match to the roles you are 
  deciding the compensation for. The closer you can match the role to the type 
  of services, locale and job title of the role you are deciding compensation 
  for, the more useful the survey is likely to be to you, especially if the survey 
  was generated in the past five years or less. </p>
