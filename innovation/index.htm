<h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About Innovation</h2>
<p>Creativity is the nature of creating something new, either a new idea, concept 
  or method. Innovation is using creativity to enhance performance of a process, 
  person, team or organization. </p>
<p>Businesses, for-profit and nonprofit, are facing change like never before. 
  Numerous driving forces to this change included a rapidly expanding marketplace 
  (globalization), and increasing competition, diversity among consumers, and 
  availability to new forms of technology. Creativity and innovation are often 
  key to the success of a business, particularly when strategizing during strategic 
  planning, and when designing new products and services. Creative thinking and 
  innovation are particularly useful during <a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm"
class="textlink">Strategic Planning</a> (when strategizing) and in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/productdevelopment/index.htm"
class="textlink">Product and Service Management</a> (when designing new products 
  and services.) (The library includes many areas of information related to creativity. 
  See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/innovation/index.htm"
class="textlink">Creativity</a>.) Also consider numerous creative methods for 
  solving <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/problem-solving.htm">problems and 
  making decisions</a>.)</p>
<h2><a name="lead" id="lead"></a>Leading Innovation</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/leadership/about-carol-muse/" target="_blank">Carol 
  Muse</a></p>
<p>Innovation is a hot topic these days. From what I have seen, organizations 
  have been outsourcing innovation for the last 10-15 years. It began with a reliance 
  on ad agencies and then shifted to &#8220;design&#8221; companies like IDEO 
  and JUMP. Now the business airwaves and media announce the need for more innovation, 
  faster and more radical than ever before, and the literature of full of &#8220;how 
  to innovate&#8221; books and articles.</p>
<p>It seems easy to say we want to innovate, but it feels like going over Niagara 
  Falls in a barrel, you are leaving all you know behind for a visit to Chaos. 
  Confronted by all the mystery and disorder that precedes innovation, our challenge 
  as leaders is to help people make meaning of the journey. As Dee Hock describes, 
  &#8220;Making good judgments and acting wisely when one has complete data, facts, 
  and knowledge [control] is not leadership. It&#8217;s not even management. It&#8217;s 
  bookkeeping. Leadership is the ability to make wise decisions, and act responsibly 
  upon them when one has little more than a clear sense of direction and proper 
  values; that is, a perception of how things ought to be, an understanding how 
  they are, and some indication of the prevalent forces driving change.&#8221; 
  In this sense, innovation is the end product of a disruptive cycle of Adaptive 
  Change.</p>
<p>To innovate is to intentionally let go of the &#8220;way things are&#8221; 
  and welcome &#8220;the way they could be.&#8221; Breakdown is the first step 
  toward innovation, an intentional release of established habits of thought, 
  expectations, assumptions, and beliefs in order to embrace &#8220;not knowing&#8221;. 
  The concept of surfing the &#8220;edge of chaos&#8221; sounds exciting until 
  you get there and leave control at the door. In Adaptive Change we call this 
  the Fall.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Breakdown doesn&#8217;t last. As we confront the mess, we naturally 
  make meaning of it, allowing order and Breakthroughs to emerge &#8211; the &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; 
  moments that we love to experience. The journey from Breakdown to Breakthrough, 
  the Cauldron of Change, is a period of stress (high enough to motivate and mobilize, 
  and potentially immobilize), uncertainty, and unpredictability. There is no 
  clear way forward, we are reduced to trial-and-error experimentation. This is 
  a period that requires a rapid and straightforward learning cycle, one that 
  encourages experimentation and taking smart risks as you learn your way forward. 
  Sense-Test-Adapt, a biomimetic cycle that is just what it says, propels you 
  forward as order emerges from the chaos. The faster you cycle the faster you 
  learn.</p>
<p>Breakthroughs get you out of Chaos and into Complexity &#8211; you are half 
  way home but you are still not &#8220;in control&#8221;. Complexity requires 
  Imagination, which takes you beyond creativity and taps into mystery. Mystery 
  allows us to explore &#8220;things in our environment that excite our curiosity 
  but elude our understanding.[1] In the complex domain hunches and ah-has pull 
  us forward by removing extraneous information and linking up ideas to form a 
  system of inquiry. In this way novelty is morphed into a myriad of possibilities.</p>
<p>With all these possibilities we begin to follow our hunches to their logical 
  conclusions, picking one or two and applying all our knowledge, know-how, technology, 
  etc. to understand them. In this way we make the imagined &#8220;real&#8221;, 
  manifest as products, programs, services, and art. Making &#8220;manifest&#8221; 
  is the phase I call Innovation. Innovation without the journey through chaos 
  and mystery is evolutionary at best, incremental most often. Innovation as the 
  conclusion of the full cycle is revolutionary, tapping into our most creative 
  spaces and pulling forth something remarkably different from where we started.<br />
  Do&#8217;s for leading innovation</p>
<p> Foster an environment of imagination, exploration, acceptable risk, and &#8220;what 
  ifs.&#8221; Meet the Devil&#8217;s Advocate at the door and refuse them entry.<br />
  Give people time to think, toys to spark off, and diverse partners to play with. 
  The resource needs and costs of Innovation rise over time. Resources that drive 
  early innovation, Breakdown, Breakthrough, and Imagination, are mainly emotional 
  and psychological support. No leader can afford to ignore these intangible costs 
  for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Relax when things seem out-of-control, it is part of the process and can&#8217;t 
  be skipped. Focus people on moving their &#8220;crazy ideas&#8221; forward and 
  making sense of them.<br />
  Apply the innovation cycle to your leadership development&#8230;hummm, now that&#8217;s 
  a thought!</p>
<h2><a name="link" id="link"></a>Linking Innovation and Operations</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.resourcesforchange.net/" target="_blank">Jim Smith</a></p>
<p>Development is hard pressed to interface with operations. Yet it is extremely 
  important that this interface be workable because developments are not relevant 
  until they find their way into operations. This is the &#8220;reason for being&#8221; 
  of development; to have new systems and adaptive processes and structures integrated, 
  in the long run, to foster organizational performance and adaptation.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s The Difference?</h3>
<p>An operation is charted to preserve the status quo, the current thinking and 
  methods. Operations assumes this status quo as a &#8220;given&#8221; and works 
  within current procedures to improve them and &#8220;operationalize&#8221; them 
  with a high degree of efficiency. In most operations the problem is clear and 
  solutions are knowable. Fast response is an overriding value in executing a 
  &#8220;fix&#8221; and getting the operation back on-line.</p>
<p>Development, on the other hand is a constructive conspiracy. It is the development 
  function, who&#8217;s job it is to replace the current ways of doing things, 
  with new tools and assumptions more in line with changing business and organizational 
  conditions. Development is rife with ambiguity; it is a searching and learning 
  process. The overriding value is gaining commitment to change.</p>
<p>Innovation and Development is fragile, complex and conceptual. Nothing kills 
  it faster than premature exploitation- rushing to capitalize on it too soon. 
  Development is not charted but it is navigable, it is a learned activity in 
  action where hunches are tested and theory is developed in the process of action. 
  The context of development is uncertainty. Operations on the other hand, works 
  to reduce uncertainty to a program, an operational term.</p>
<h3>Learning It While Doing It</h3>
<p>Operations are based in control. Developments emerge and are always subject 
  to un- intended consequences in action as development is moved toward its purpose. 
  One of the themes of these essays is that developments are realized through 
  the process of development, it is in effect learned in the process of doing 
  it.</p>
<p>Usually there is not a great deal of organizational understanding and support 
  for doing this. An often operation does not see the need or understand the purpose 
  of the development itself. For this reason, development needs protection at 
  a certain stage. Protection and understanding go hand in hand. As the development 
  is understood the protection can be loosened which is necessary to gain the 
  institutional support for prioritizing the resources for more disciplined development.</p>
<p>Boundary management means the protection and support of a differentiated development 
  culture and the managed change of this culture when appropriate. Boundary management 
  is a continual effort of judgment and balance because technical organizations 
  optimize performance and their activities are always influenced by demands and 
  feedback from a variety of sources in the global environment. Establishing and 
  managing boundaries is both necessary and problematic.</p>
