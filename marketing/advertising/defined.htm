<p>It's easy to become confused about these terms: advertising,
marketing, promotion, public relations and publicity, and sales.
The terms are often used interchangeably. However, they refer
to different -- but similar activities. Some basic definitions
are provided below. A short example is also provided hopefully
to help make the terms more clear to the reader.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Advertising</h2>

<p>Advertising is bringing a product (or service) to the attention
of potential and current customers. Advertising is focused on
one particular product or service. Thus, an advertising plan for
one product might be very different than that for another product.
Advertising is typically done with signs, brochures, commercials,
direct mailings or e-mail messages, personal contact, etc.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Promotion</h2>

<p>Promotion keeps the product in the minds of the customer and
helps stimulate demand for the product. Promotion involves ongoing
advertising and publicity (mention in the press). The ongoing
activities of advertising, sales and public relations are often
considered aspects of promotions.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Marketing</h2>

<p>Marketing is the wide range of activities involved in making
sure that you're continuing to meet the needs of your customers
and getting value in return. Marketing is usually focused on one
product or service. Thus, a marketing plan for one product might
be very different than that for another product. Marketing activities
include &quot;inbound marketing,&quot; such as market research
to find out, for example, what groups of potential customers exist,
what their needs are, which of those needs you can meet, how you
should meet them, etc. Inbound marketing also includes analyzing
the competition, positioning your new product or service (finding
your market niche), and pricing your products and services. &quot;Outbound
marketing&quot; includes promoting a product through continued
advertising, promotions, public relations and sales.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Public relations</h2>

<p>Public relations includes ongoing activities to ensure the
overall company has a strong public image. Public relations activities
include helping the public to understand the company and its products.
Often, public relations are conducted through the media, that
is, newspapers, television, magazines, etc. As noted above, public
relations is often considered as one of the primary activities
included in promotions.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Publicity</h2>

<p>Publicity is mention in the media. Organizations usually have
little control over the message in the media, at least, not as
they do in advertising. Regarding publicity, reporters and writers
decide what will be said.</p>

<h2>One Definition of Sales</h2>

<p>Sales involves most or many of the following activities, including
cultivating prospective buyers (or leads) in a market segment;
conveying the features, advantages and benefits of a product or
service to the lead; and closing the sale (or coming to agreement
on pricing and services). A sales plan for one product might be
very different than that for another product.</p>

<h2>An Example of the Definitions</h2>

<p>The following example may help to make the above five concepts
more clear. I recently read that the story comes from the <i>Reader's
Digest</i>, a quote found in &quot;Promoting Issues and Ideas&quot;
by M. Booth and Associates, Inc. (Thanks to Jennifer M. Seher,
participant in the CONSULTANTS@CHARITYCHANNEL.COM online discussion
group.)</p>

<p>&quot;... if the circus is coming to town and you paint a sign
saying 'Circus Coming to the Fairground Saturday', that's <b>advertising</b>.
If you put the sign on the back of an elephant and walk it into
town, that's <b>promotion</b>. If the elephant walks through the
mayor's flower bed, that's <b>publicity</b>. And if you get the
mayor to laugh about it, that's <b>public relations</b>.&quot;
If the town's citizens go the circus, you show them the many entertainment
booths, explain how much fun they'll have spending money at the
booths, answer their questions and ultimately, they spend a lot
at the circus, that's <b>sales</b>.</p>
