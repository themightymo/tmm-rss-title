<h2>First, A Word About Writing Ads</h2>

It's almost useless to review lists of alternatives
for advertising if you haven't developed well-written ads. Writing
ads is a skill. There are important aspects to think about, including
the wording, graphics, arrangement of wording and graphics, coloring,
how your audience will interpret the ads, their placement, etc.
Poorly done ads can hurt you worse than not having ads at all.
Therefore, very carefully consider getting help to write your
first ads. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor426355">Writing
Your Ad</a>.)</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor4294042928"></a>
<h2>What Should You Write in Your Ads?</h2>

The answer to this question depends almost entirely
on the reading and listening habits of your current and potential
customers. This is where some basic market research can help you
a great deal. A lot can be learned by using a few basic methods.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm">Basic Methods to Get
Customer Feedback</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm">Some Major Sources
of Market Research Information</a>.)</p>

<p>Before you write your ads, you should give careful thought
to your unique selling position so you know what unique features
and benefits to convey and to whom. Review information in <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/positioning.htm">Positioning.</a>
</p>

<p>Note that a common mistake among inexperienced ad writers is
to write the ad to themselves, rather than to their current and
potential customers. Your ads should clearly the benefits (of
products and services) to customers, not the benefits to you --
clearly state the ads in terms that the customer will value, for
example, easy access, low cost, easy to use, reliability, etc.
Your ads should answer the customer's question: &quot;What's in it for me?&quot; Your ad should also specify what they are to
do next. What action should they take and how do they take it,
for example, who do they call and how.</p>

<p>

<h2>Major Methods
of Advertising (Repeatedly Getting Message Out)</h2>
<h3>Brochures or flyers </h3>
-- Many desk-top
publishing and word-processing software packages can produce highly
attractive tri-fold (an 8.5 inch by 11-inch sheet folded in thirds)
brochures. Brochures can contain a great deal of information if
designed well, and are becoming a common method of advertising.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/how-to-write-procedures.htm">Writing Brochures</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Direct mail</i></b> -- Mail sent directly from
you to your customers can be highly customized to suit their nature
and needs. You may want to build a mailing list of your current
and desired customers. Collect addresses from customers by noticing
addresses on their checks, asking them to fill out information
cards, etc. Keep the list online and up-to-date. Mailing lists
can quickly become out-of-date. Notice mailings that get returned
to you. This should be used carefully and it can incur substantial
cost, you don't want to inundate your stakeholders with information
so make the most of your message. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor429843">Using
Direct Mail</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor1938549">Mailing
Lists</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>E-mail messages</i></b> -- These can be wonderful means
to getting the word out about your business. Design your e-mail
software to include a &quot;signature line&quot; at the end of
each of your e-mail messages. Many e-mail software packages will
automatically attach this signature line to your e-mail, if you
prefer. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/email-writing-reading.htm">Netiquette
- Techniques and styles of writing e-mail messages</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/email-versus-voice-mail.htm">E-mail vs.
voice mail</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Magazines</i></b> -- Magazines ads can get quite expensive.
Find out if there's a magazine that focuses on your particular
industry. If there is one, then the magazine can be very useful
because it already focuses on your market and potential customers.
Consider placing an ad or writing a short article for the magazine.
Contact a reporter to introduce yourself. Reporters are often
on the look out for new stories and sources from which to collect
quotes. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor430093">Classifieds
of Newspapers and Magazines</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Newsletters</i></b> -- This can be powerful means to
conveying the nature of your organization and its services. Consider
using a consultant for the initial design and layout. Today's
desktop publishing tools can generate very interesting newsletters
quite inexpensively. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/how-to-write-newsletters.htm">Newsletters</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Newspapers</i></b> <b><i>(major)</i></b> - Almost everyone
reads the local, major newspaper(s). You can get your business
in the newspaper by placing ads, writing a letter to the editor
or working with a reporter to get a story written about your business.
Advertising can get quite expensive. Newspaper are often quite
useful in giving advice about what and how to advertise. Know
when to advertise -- this depends on the buying habits of your
customers. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor430093">Classifieds
of Newspapers and Magazines</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Newspapers (neighborhood)</i></b> -- Ironically, these
are often forgotten in lieu of major newspapers, yet the neighborhood
newspapers are often closest to the interests of the organization's
stakeholders. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor430093">Classifieds
of Newspapers and Magazines</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Online discussion groups and chat groups</i></b> --
As with e-mail, you can gain frequent exposure to yourself and
your business by participating in online discussion groups and
chat groups. Note, however, that many groups have strong groundrules
against blatant advertising. When you join a group, always check
with the moderator to understand what is appropriate. (See the groups listed on the right-hand side, <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/email-writing-reading.htm">Netiquette
- Techniques and styles of writing e-mail messages</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/email-versus-voice-mail.htm">E-mail vs.
voice mail</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Posters and bulletin boards</i></b> -- Posters can be
very powerful when placed where your customers will actually notice
them. But think of how often you've actually noticed posters and
bulletin boards yourself. Your best bet is to place the posters
on bulletin boards and other places which your customers frequent,
and always refresh your posters with new and colorful posters
that will appear new to passers by. Note that some businesses
and municipalities have regulations about the number of size of
posters that can be placed in their areas. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor424569">Signs
and Displays</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Radio announcements</i></b> -- A major advantage of radio
ads is they are usually cheaper than television ads, and many
people still listen to the radio, for example, when in their cars.
Ads are usually sold on a package basis that considers the number
of ads, the length of ads and when they are put on the air. .
A major consideration with radio ads is to get them announced
at the times that your potential customers are listening to the
radio. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor604248">Advertising
on Radio and T.V.</a>)</p>

<p><b><i>Telemarketing</i></b> -- The use of telemarketing is
on the rise. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/telemarketing.htm">Telemarketing</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Television ads</i></b> -- Many people don't even consider
television ads because of the impression that the ads are very
expensive. They are more expensive than most of major forms of
advertising. However, with the increasing number of television
networks and stations, businesses might find good deals for placing
commercials or other forms of advertisements. Television ads usually
are priced with similar considerations to radio ads, that is,
the number of ads, the length of ads and when they are put on
the air. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor604248">Advertising
on Radio and T.V.</a>)</p>

<p><b><i>Web pages</i> --</b> You probably would not have seen
this means of advertising on a list of advertising methods if
you had read a list even two years ago. Now, advertising and promotions
on the World Wide Web are almost commonplace. Businesses are developing
Web pages sometimes just to appear up-to-date. Using the Web for
advertising requires certain equipment and expertise, including
getting a computer, getting an Internet service provider, buying
(usually renting) a Website name, designing and installing the
Website graphics and other functions as needed (for example,
an online store for e-commerce), promoting the Website (via
various search engines, directories, etc.) and maintaining the
Website. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/computers/web.htm">Building, Managing
and Promoting Your Website</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm#anchor429496">Online
Advertising and Promotions</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Yellow Pages</i></b> --The Yellow Pages can be very effective
advertising if your ads are well-placed in the directory's categories
of services, and the name of your business is descriptive of your
services and/or your ad stands out (for example, is bolded, in
a large box on the page, etc.). The phone company will offer free
advice about placing your ad in the Yellow Pages. They usually
have special packages where you get a business phone line along
with a certain number of ads.</p>

<h2>Promotional
Activities Through the Media (Reporters, Newspapers, etc.)</h2>
<b><i>Articles that you write</i></b> --
Is there something in your industry or market about you have a
strong impression? Consider writing an article for the local newspaper
or a magazine. In your article, use the opportunity to describe
what you're doing to address the issue through use of your business.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/index.htm#anchor1589638">Basic Writing
Skills</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Editorials and letters to the editor</i></b> -- Often,
program providers are experts at their service and understanding
a particular need in the community; newspapers often take strong
interest in information about these needs, so staff should regularly
offer articles (of about 200 to 900 words) for publication. (See
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/publicrelations/index.htm#anchor1192381">Managing Media Relations</a>
and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businesswriting/index.htm#anchor1589638">Basic Writing
Skills.</a>)</p>

<p><b><i>Press kits</i></b> -- This kit is handy when working
with the media or training employees about working with the media.
The kit usually includes information about your business, pictures,
information about your products, commentary from happy customers,
etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/publicrelations/index.htm#anchor1192381">Managing Media
Relations</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Press releases or news alerts</i></b> -- They
alert the press to a major event or accomplishment and requesting,
e.g., it get included in the newspaper; they explain who, what,
where, why and when; some include pictures, quotes, etc. to make
it easier for the reporter to develop an announcement or story.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/publicrelations/index.htm#anchor1192381">Managing Media Relations</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Public service announcements (PSA)s</i></b> -- Many radio
and some television stations will provide public service announcements
for nonprofit efforts. Usually, these PSAs are free.</p>

<hr align="left" />
<p>
<a name="anchor4293953708"></a>
<h2>Other
Promotional Activities and Events</h2>
<b><i>Annual reports</i></b> - Disseminate these to key stakeholders;
they're ripe with information if they include an overview of your
year's activities, accomplishments, challenges and financial status.
(See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/nonprofitfinances/index.htm#anchor1770427">Annual
Reports</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Collaboration or strategic restructuring</i></b> - If
you're organization is undertaking these activities, celebrate
it publicly. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/alliances/index.htm">Organizational
Alliances</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Networking</i></b> - Spread the word to peers, professional
organizations and those with whom you interact outside the organizations,
e.g., educators, consultants, suppliers, clients, etc. (See Networking.)</p>

<p><b><i>Novelties</i></b> -- It seems more common to find ads
placed on pens and pencils, coffee cups, T-shirts, etc. These
can be powerful means of advertising if indeed current and potential
customers see the novelties. This condition often implies additional
costs to mail novelties, print T-shirts, etc.</p>

<p><b><i>Presentations</i></b> -- You're probably an expert at
something. Find ways to give even short presentations, for example,
at local seminars, Chamber of Commerce meetings, trade shows,
conventions, seminars, etc. It's amazing that one can send out
500 brochures and be lucky to get 5 people who respond. Yet, you
can give a presentation to 30 people and 15 of them will be very
interested in staying in touch with you. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/public-speaking.htm">Presenting</a>.)</p>

<p><b><i>Relationships with key stakeholders</i></b> -- Identify
at least one representative from each major stakeholder group
and take them to lunch once a year. What seem as short, informal
exchanges can cultivate powerful relationships of interest and
concern.</p>

<p><b><i>Special events</i> --</b> These tend to attract attention,
and can include, e.g., an open house, granting a special award,
announcing a major program or service or campaign, etc.</p>

<p><b><i>Special offers</i> --</b> We see these offers all the time. They include, 
  for example, coupons, discounts, sweepstakes, sales, etc.</p>

<h2>Recent Movement in Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations -- Social Networking 
  (Online)</h2>
<p>Social networking involves a variety of online tools that can be used by people 
  and organizations to quickly share a great deal of information at very little 
  cost. Many people are now hearing of some of those tools, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, 
  MySpace and Youtube. Experts are asserting that social networking is a must 
  for people and organizations wanting to share information with others -- after 
  all, that's what marketing is all about! For more information, see<br />
