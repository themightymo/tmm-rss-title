<h2>Basics and Planning</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Advertising and promotions is bringing a service to the attention
of potential and current customers. Advertising and promotions
are best carried out by implementing an advertising and promotions
plan. The goals of the plan should depend very much on the overall
goals and strategies of the organization, and the results of the
marketing analysis, including the positioning statement (these
are described more in the topic of <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/index.htm"
class="textlink">Marketing</a>).</p>

<p>The plan usually includes what target markets you want to reach,
what features and benefits you want to convey to them, how you
will convey it to them (this is often called your advertising
campaign), who is responsible to carry the various activities
in the plan and how much money is budgeted for this effort. Successful
advertising depends very much on knowing the preferred methods
and styles of communications of each of the target markets that
you want to reach with your ads. A media plan and calendar can
be very useful, which specifies what advertising methods are used
and when.</p>

<p>For <u>each</u> product or service, carefully consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What target markets are you trying to reach with your ads?</li>
  <li>What would you like <u>each target market</u> to think and
  perceive about your products (this should be in terms of benefits
  to them, not you)? Realize that each target market might be different.</li>
  <li>How can you get that target market to think and perceive
  that, that is, what message do you need to convey?</li>
  <li>What communications media does that target market see or
  prefer the most? Consider TV, radio, newsletters, classifieds,
  displays/signs, posters, word of mouth, press releases, direct
  mail, special events, brochures, neighborhood newsletters, etc.</li>
  <li>What media is most practical for you to use in terms of access
  and affordability for that target market (the amount spent on
  advertising is often based on the revenue expected from the product
  or service, that is, the sales forecast)? Use that preferred
  media to convey the message(s).</li>
  <li>Who will communicate the messages in the most appropriate
  media to that target market.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can often find out a lot about your customers preferences
just by conducting some basic market research methods (see the
topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm"
class="textlink">Market Research</a>). The following closely related
