<h3>What is Marketing? What is PR?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve likely heard it before &#8211; in the digital world, &#8220;The 
  lines have blurred between Marketing and PR.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does that mean? How have the lines blurred? In order to answer these questions, 
  let&#8217;s take a look at the OLD versus the NEW rules of Marketing, as proposed 
  by <a href="http://www.webinknow.com/" target="_blank">David Meerman Scott</a> in his bestselling 
  book, <em>The New Rules of Marketing and PR</em>.</p>
<h3>The OLD Rules of Marketing</h3>
<p>The message was delivered ONE-WAY, and CREATIVITY was the secret sauce that 
  commanded the audience&#8217;s attention. Among the fundamental concepts of 
  the OLD marketing paradigm:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Advertising was the core tool</li>
  <li>The advertising message was generally crafted to appeal to the masses</li>
  <li>Advertising INTERRUPTED the audience with a one-way message</li>
  <li>Advertising engaged campaigns for a defined time period</li>
  <li>Creators focused on creativity &#8211; and award-winning campaigns</li>
  <li>Advertising and PR were different specialties, run by different people</li>
</ul>
<h3>The OLD Rules of PR</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal: Spin a press release to capture reporters&#8217; attention, 
  then get a clip of the story, to show that the message was viewed by the audience.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Media comprised the toolbox, in order to get the message out</li>
  <li>A press release was the core tool</li>
  <li>Only significant news commanded the attention of the media</li>
  <li>It was all in &#8220;the spin&#8221; (or HYPE!)</li>
  <li>Quotes from third parties were an important element of a press release</li>
  <li>Press releases were meaningless unless a reporter decided that it was worthy 
    of a story</li>
</ul>
<h3>The NEW Rules of Marketing and PR</h3>
<p>Since the internet is now one huge publisher, ANYONE can learn how to create 
  compelling messages and publish them. Getting found online is the science and 
  art. A few of the new rules include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> People don&#8217;t want &#8220;spin&#8221; &#8211; they want authenticity</li>
  <li>People don&#8217;t want to be interrupted anymore (it&#8217;s now called 
    SPAM)</li>
  <li>People don&#8217;t want to be &#8216;told&#8217; (push marketing), they 
    want to be heard</li>
  <li>People want VALUE (content), which develops relationship and trust</li>
  <li>Marketing and PR can reach niche audiences online in a wider variety of 
    ways</li>
  <li>Content is KING, and stays online, with no end to the campaign</li>
</ul>
<h3>The New TOOLS of Marketing and PR</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no longer TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, etc. Meaningful, 
  valuable CONTENT is the vehicle that captures audiences&#8217; attention. It 
  is now found on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Websites</li>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Microblogs (Tweets)</li>
  <li>Social Media platforms (Facebook.com, Myspace.com, etc)</li>
  <li>Article Directories</li>
  <li>Videos</li>
  <li>Podcasts</li>
  <li>Etc, etc etc!<br />
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Makin&#8217; the Marketing Strategy Happen!</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.partnerscreatingwealth.com/bio/" target="_blank">Tove Rasmussen</a></p>
<p>Implementing a marketing strategy is a multi-faceted activity. A good marketing 
  strategy is driven by a clear, simple positioning statement. This makes it clear 
  to your employees and market, where the company is superior to the competition. 
  The marketing strategy encompasses the product or service offering, pricing, 
  promotion and distribution &#8211; or delivery of the product or service to 
  your customers.</p>
<p>So, the marketing strategy is all-encompassing. It drives product features, 
  time from order to delivery, logistics, research and development, customer services 
  &#8212; in short, it drives what is key for all facets of the business.</p>
<p>Consequently, implementing a marketing strategy involves so much more than 
  marketing. It involves the whole company.</p>
<p>How you implement the marketing strategy depends who you are in the organization. 
  Are you the president or the marketing director? If the organization has developed 
  a marketing strategy, both need to be aligned with the strategy, on-board and 
  enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The implementation of the marketing strategy can begin with the development 
  of the marketing strategy. The organization can be involved or informed of the 
  status of the development of the strategy. The input of operations, regulatory 
  and sales can be part of the information that is used to develop the strategy.</p>
<p>Or the strategy can be developed by the management team, and rolled out to 
  the company once it is completed. The extent to which each approach works, depends 
  a lot on the issues involved with the strategy development, the culture of the 
  company, and the buy-in to the plan by the company as a whole.</p>
<p>If, for example, operations was asked for an opinion, it is very important 
  to close the loop, and let operations know what happened to the input. How it 
  was used in developing the plan and, if possible, how the input affected the 
  final strategy that was developed.</p>
<p>If the plan is being rolled out with no input, then it is critical for the 
  department heads to consider the expected response from their teams, and to 
  ensure the potential issues will be addressed. If unexpected issues are raised, 
  it is critical to research these issues and respond to them. However, the key 
  is to effectively demonstrate how the plan is in the interest of each department, 
  in particular, the growth of the company. Information that provides confidence 
  in this result is essential to provide, and an inclusive, enthusiastic, confident 
  tenor of the meeting is important.</p>
<p>However, it is much more than one roll out meeting, or several roll out meetings. 
  Implementation includes the informal discussions in the hall, during chance 
  encounters, in regular meetings. People will absorb the information, and come 
  up with excellent questions that need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the formal implementation of the strategy as well. It 
  will translate into objectives for performance evaluations, possibly organization 
  shifts and changes.</p>
<p>As the company moves through the changes, focus on gaining some small wins 
  first. This increases confidence in the new strategy and increases momentum. 
  Keep it forefront in the company, stay positive and flexible.</p>
