<h2>What's a Direct Competitor? Indirect Competitor?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Most of us are used to thinking of direct competitors &#8211; organizations 
  that have products and services similar to ours and provided to the same target 
  markets. However, there are also indirect competitors and they can have a strong 
  adverse affect on your marketing plans. </p>
<p>Indirect competitors are organizations that, while providing a somewhat different 
  products and services, can affect your target market in such as way that it 
  might not have a need for your products and services. For example, if you sell 
  an educational product that aims to help high-school drop-outs obtain a high-school 
  diploma, then an indirect competitor might be a nonprofit that provides services 
  to reduce the overall high-school drop-out rate. </p>
