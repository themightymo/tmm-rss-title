<h1>How to Conduct Market Research</h1>

<p>Various methods of market research are used to find out information
about markets, target markets and their needs, competitors, market
trends, customer satisfaction with products and services, etc.
Businesses can learn a great deal about customers, their needs,
how to meet those needs and how the business is doing to meet
those needs. Businesses need not to be experts at methods of research
either.</p>

<h2><a name="role" id="role"></a>Critical Role of Market Research</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter

<p>It is extremely difficult to develop and provide a high-quality product or 
  service without conducting at least some basic market research. Some people 
  have a strong aversion to the word &#8220;research&#8221; because they believe 
  that the word implies a highly sophisticated set of techniques that only highly 
  trained people can use. Some people also believe that, too often, research generates 
  lots of useless data that is in lots of written reports that rarely are ever 
  read, much less used in the real world. This is a major misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Odds are that you have already conducted at least some basic forms of market 
  research. For example, you have listened (a research technique) to others complain 
  about not having enough of something -- that should suggest providing what they 
  need in the form of a product or service. </p>
<p>Market research has a variety of purposes and a variety of data collection 
  methods might be used for each purpose. The particular data collection method 
  that you use during your market research depends very much on the particular 
  information that you are seeking to understand. </p>
<h3>Uses for Market Research</h3>
<p>The following paragraphs mention some of the primary uses for market research. 
  Useful data collection methods are associated with most of the items in the 
  following list. </p>
<h3>1. Identify opportunities to serve various groups of customers. </h3>
<p>Verify and understand the unmet needs of a certain group (or market) of customers. 
  What do they say that they want? What do they say that they need? Some useful 
  data collection methods might be, for example, conducting focus groups, interviewing 
  customers and investors, reading the newspaper and other key library publications, 
  and listening to what clients say and observing what they do. Later on, you 
  might even develop a preliminary version of your product that you pilot, or 
  test market, to verify if the product would sell or not.</p>
<h3>2. Examine the size of the market &#8211; how many people have the unmet need.</h3>
<p>Identify various subgroups, or market segments, in that overall market along 
  with each of their unique features and preferences. Useful data collection methods 
  might be, for example, reading about demographic and societal trends in publications 
  at the library. You might even observe each group for a while to notice what 
  they do, where they go and what they discuss. Consider interviewing some members 
  of each group. Finally, consider conducting a focus group or two among each 
  group. </p>
<h3>3. Determine the best methods to meet the unmet needs of the target markets. 
</h3>
<p>How can you develop a product with the features and benefits to meet that unmet 
  need? How can you ensure that you have the capacity to continue to meet the 
  demand? Here&#8217;s where focus groups can really come in handy. Conduct some 
  focus groups, including asking them about their preferences, unmet needs and 
  how those needs might be met. Run your ideas past them. At the same time, ask 
  them what they would need to use your services and what they would pay for them. 
</p>
<h3>4. Investigate the competition.</h3>
<p>Examine their products, services, marketing techniques, pricing, location, 
  etc. One of the best ways to understand your competitors is to use their services. 
  Go to their location, look around and look at some of their literature. Notice 
  their ads in newsletters and the newspaper. Look at their web sites. </p>
<h3>5. Clarify your unique value proposition.</h3>
<p>Your proposition describes why others should use your organization and not 
  the competition&#8217;s. A particularly useful data collection method in this 
  area is the use of focus groups. Get some groups of potential clients together 
  and tell them about your ideas. Tell them how your ideas are unique. Tell them 
  how you would want your program to be seen (its positioning). Ask them what 
  they think. </p>
<h3>6. Conclude if the product is effectively meeting the needs of the customers. 
</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to make this conclusion is to conduct an evaluation. An 
  evaluation often includes the use of various data collection methods, usually 
  several of them, for example, observing clients, interviewing them, administrating 
  questionnaires with them, developing some case studies, and, ideally, conducting 
  a product field test, or pilot. </p>
<h3>7. Conclude if your advertising and promotions strategies are effective or 
  not.</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to make this conclusion is to evaluate the results of 
  the advertising. This could include use of several data collection methods among 
  your clients, such as observing clients, interviewing them, administrating questionnaires 
  with them, developing some case studies. </p>

<h2><a name="methods" id="methods"></a>Basic Methods to Get Information and Feedback 
  from Customers</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter 
McNamara, MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Far too often, we think we know what our customers think and want because -- 
  well, we just know, that's all. Wrong! Businesses can't be successful if they 
  don't continue to meet the needs of their customers. Period. There should be 
  few activities as important as finding out what your customers want for products 
  and services and finding out what they think of yours. Fortunately, there are 
  a variety of practical methods that businesses can use to feedback from customers.</p>
<p>The methods you choose and how you use them depend on what the type of feedback 
  that you want from customers, for example, to find out their needs in products 
  and services, what they think about your products and services, etc.</p>
<h3>Employees</h3>
Your employees are usually the people who interact the most with your customers. 
Ask them about products and services that customers are asking for. Ask employees 
about what the customers complain about.
<h3>Comment Cards</h3>
Provide brief, half-page comment cards on which they can answer basic questions 
such as: Were you satisfied with our services? How could we provide the perfect 
services? Are there any services you'd like to see that don't exist yet?
<h3>Competition</h3>
What is your competition selling? Ask people who shop there. Many people don't 
notice sales or major items in stores. Start coaching those around you to notice 
what's going on with your competition. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/competitors.htm">Competitive 
Analysis</a>.)
<h3>Customers</h3>
One of the best ways to find out what customers want is to ask them. Talk to them 
when they visit your facility or you visit theirs. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/questionaires.htm">Questioning</a> 
and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/listening-skills.htm">Listening</a>.)
<h3>Documentation and Records</h3>
Notice what customers are buying and not buying from you. If you already know 
what customers are buying, etc., then is this written down somewhere? It should 
be so that you don't forget, particularly during times of stress or when trying 
to train personnel to help you out.
<h3>Focus Groups</h3>
Focus groups are usually 8-10 people that you gather to get their impressions 
of a product or service or an idea. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/focus-groups.htm">Focus 
Groups</a>.)
<h3>Surveys by Mail</h3>
You might hate answering these things, but plenty of people don't -- and will 
fill our surveys especially if they get something in return. Promise them a discount 
if they return the completed form to your facility. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/surveys.htm">Survey 
Design</a>.)
<h3>Telephone Surveys</h3>
<p>Hire summer students or part-time people for a few days every six months to 
  do telephone surveys. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/surveys.htm">Survey 
  Design</a>.) </p>
<h2><a name="major" id="major"></a>Some Major Sources of Market Research Information</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter 
  McNamara, MBA, PhD</a></p>
<h3>Census Bureau</h3>
<p>There is a vast amount of information available to you, and much of this is 
  online.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Get to know the people in your local office. Offices usually have a wealth 
  of information about localities, sources of networking, community resources 
  to help your business, etc.</p>
<h3>Department of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Department has offices in various regions across the country and publishes 
  a wide range of information about industries, products and services.</p>
<h3>Ask Librarians</h3>
<p>They love to help people. See the Directory of Associations, Sales and Marketing 
  Management magazine, American Statistics Index (ASI), Encyclopedia Of Business 
  Information Book, Standard &amp; Poor's Industry Survey's and Consumer's Index.</p>
<h3>Trade and Professional Organizations</h3>
<p>Organizations often produce highly useful newsletters for members, along with 
  services for networking, answering questions, etc.</p>
<h3>Trade and Professional Publications</h3>
<p>These have become much more useful as various trades become more specialized 
  and their expectations are increasing for timely and useful information</p>
