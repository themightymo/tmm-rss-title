<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What is a Pricing Analysis?</h2>

<p>Marketing should include pricing analysis to decide how much to charge customers 
  for a product or service and how that charge should be done, for example, as 
  a fixed fee, sliding-fee scale, discounts or monthly payments..</p>
<p>Several major factors influence the pricing for a product or service. Strategic 
  goals greatly influence pricing. For example, if the business really wants to 
  get into a new market, then it might charge lower than usual prices in order 
  to generate more customers who buy the service. The business might consider 
  changing pricing if the demand for its products are very high or low. Competitor 
  pricing also has a great effect. If competitors are charging much less, then 
  the business might do well to lower prices. Similarly, if the competitor is 
  charging much more, then the business might consider increasing its own prices.</p>

<p>In this pricing analysis, consider: Is your business recouping your costs (time, 
  money, materials, etc.) to provide it? Is it affordable to customers? What about 
  volume or other forms of discounts? What should be the new prices, if any? How 
  do you know?</p>

<p>Figuring out how to price your products or services is often very challenging, 
  especially for a new venture. Yet you need a pricing strategy for your business 
  plan, to determine your break-even point and profitability, and of course to 
  launch your business. Here are some tips on how to make that decision:</p>
<p>Ultimately, the right price is usually the highest price customers will find 
  attractive &#8212; that is to say, that they will find meets or exceeds their 
  value expectations for the product or service you&#8217;re offering to them. 
  That&#8217;s much easier said than done, so let&#8217;s start with some steps 
  for getting there.</p>
<h3>First, Determine Your Unit Costs</h3>
<p>Generally this should be relatively easy. What will it cost you to purchase, 
  produce and sell your products? You may not know the precise figure, but you 
  should have a pretty good idea by the time you write your business plan. Generally 
  speaking, that represents your price floor; sell below that and you lose money.<br />
  Next, determine how customers value your products</p>
<p>This is where market research is needed. The good news is that customers will 
  tell you how much they&#8217;ll pay &#8212; if you can find the right way to 
  ask. You can&#8217;t just ask them directly, for tons of research show that 
  what they say and what they&#8217;ll do are two completely different realities. 
  But what you can do is find out what they pay for more or less comparable things, 
  and how they value various attributes of your product or service, particularly 
  those different from your competitors. Be sure to study the pricing strategies 
  of your competitors. Not necessarily to imitate but to recognize that your customers 
  will be comparing what you offer (product, price, service) with what they offer.</p>
<p>Here are several of the most common pricing strategies:</p>
<h3>Penetration Pricing</h3>
<p>This is the low-cost approach, where you initially offer a price lower than 
  your competitor&#8217;s for the purpose of attracting price-sensitive customers 
  quickly. The downside of course is that you squeeze your profits; indeed in 
  many cases new ventures choose to price below cost to bring in those early customers. 
  The logic is that over time you become more efficient and can take advantage 
  of bulk purchasing of raw materials, such that you begin to achieve profitability 
  at that low price. The other downside is that your competitors might just match 
  your price.</p>
<h3>Premium Pricing</h3>
<p>This kind of pricing is coupled with providing superior benefits or service 
  compared to your competitors, to justify that higher price. Sometimes a premium 
  price will be charged for some products to attract customers who want that premium 
  quality, with other products are priced lower to attract those who are more 
  value-focused. A related pricing strategy is called Complementary Pricing, or 
  Loss Leader Pricing, where you charge and promote a super low price for one 
  product to bring folks &#8220;in the door,&#8221; but then &#8220;upsell&#8221; 
  them for something else more expensive at the point of sale.</p>
<h3>Price Bundling</h3>
<p>This is a common strategy for getting customers to buy more of your products, 
  by offering a deal for buying a package. Purchase internet access along with 
  your phone service for a discounted price. This strategy can be very effective 
  in that the customer perceives value, while the provider increases sales and, 
  ideally, a long term customer who spends more for each purchase.</p>
<h3>New Customer Pricing</h3>
<p>Sometimes called experience pricing, this involves offering a low initial price 
  for new customers, occasionally below cost, to get customers to &#8220;try&#8221; 
  your product. It&#8217;s a one-time price, offered in hopes that while they&#8217;ll 
  come in for the low price, they&#8217;ll come back for the high quality. This 
  is sometimes done with special coupons, and, in today&#8217;s world, is often 
  facilitated by group purchasing services such as Groupon.</p>
