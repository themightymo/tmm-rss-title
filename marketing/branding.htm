<h3>Naming Your Organization or Product</h3>
<p>To effectively promote your product, you must have a concise, yet meaningful 
  description of the product. This can be much more complicated than merely picking 
  a name. There are consultancies built around helping organizations to name or 
  brand their products and services. You have to be sure that you're not using 
  a name that is already trademarked or servicemarked. You should not have a name 
  that closely resembles an already established name in your area, or customers 
  will confuse your services with those referred to by the other name -- or, the 
  organization with the other name may choose to sue you. You need a name that 
  makes sense locally, but if you grow, the name will still be understood elsewhere. 
  The name you choose for your product will be around for a long time and can 
  have substantial impact on how your products are perceived. Therefore, seriously 
  consider some basic forms of market research to glean impressions of different 
  names. For example, convene several focus groups to glean their reactions to 
  various names. Have survey cards that clients can complete to suggest names.</p>
<h3>Branding Your Organization or Product</h3>
<p>To effectively promote your organization or product, you need to continue to 
  establish its strong reputation and personality, or brand, for it. To understand 
  what a brand is, think of some very common company names, the logos they use, 
  the slogans it uses, the standard colors of the logos and the types of values 
  that it tries to convey in its advertising. All of those together accomplish 
  the company's brand -- so the name is really part of the overall brand. There 
  can be a brand for an organization and for each of its products. Similar to 
  naming an organization or product, the brand should be unique. </p>
<p>That's why it's useful to develop the name and brand during the same activity 
  -- an activity that should include researching what other companies are using, 
  what stakeholders (or distinct types of groups) you want to influence, and what 
  you want each group to think about you. As with other aspects of the marketing 
  analysis, the choice of the research methods you choose to use depends on your 
  skill level, the resources that you have available, what you can afford and 
  how much time you have. </p>
<p>1. You need a name that conveys the nature of the service and, ideally, your 
  unique value proposition -- your unique value proposition is a concise description 
  of your product or service, how it is unique, and why people should buy from 
  you, rather than from your competitors. </p>
<p> 2. You need a name and brand that makes sense locally, but will still be understood 
  if the program extends elsewhere. The name you choose will be around for a long 
  time and can have substantial impact on how your services are perceived. </p>
<p>3. You have to be sure that you are not using a name that is already trademarked 
  or service marked. You might verify this by:<br />
  a) Looking in the Yellow Pages of your local telephone directory.<br />
  b) Calling the appropriate governmental office (for example, contact the Secretary 
  <br />
  of State&#8217;s office in the USA or contact the appropriate provincial office 
  in <br />
  Canada) to see if similar names are registered.<br />
  c) Looking in any on-line databases of registered and applied-for names (for 
  <br />
  example, see the web site of the federal Patents and Trademark Offices at <br />
  http://www.uspto.gov/ in the USA)</p>
<p>4. You should not have a name that closely resembles an already established 
  name in your geographic area or service field because clients will confuse your 
  services with those referred to by the other name. The organization with the 
  other name may even choose to sue you. </p>
<p>5. Should you use a different name for each target market? Note that you can 
  likely benefit a great deal from hiring a marketing consultant to help you design 
  and build your marketing materials so they effectively convey the personality, 
  or brand, of your program and the overall organization. The consultant can help 
  you with selection and design of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Colors</li>
  <li>Logo (text and image)</li>
  <li>Business cards</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Envelopes</li>
  <li>Web pages</li>
</ul>

<p>We are all over-messaged in this harried world &#8211; absolutely bombarded 
  with thousands of messages every single day. So how can your business stand 
  out?</p>
<p>To be successful, your company&#8217;s marketing must be creatively distinctive. 
  That&#8217;s what it takes to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Capture the attention of your target audience, and</li>
  <li>Deliver a clear and memorable message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your marketing must be laser-focused. It cannot be everything to everybody. 
  What should your marketing message achieve?</p>
<ul>
  <li> Image &amp; Branding</li>
  <li>Recognition, Credibility &amp; Trust</li>
  <li>Call to Action</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business Branding Basics</h3>
<p>Your company is only as powerful as your BRAND. A company&#8217;s brand, like 
  an individual&#8217;s personality, is unique &#8211; and should clearly convey 
  the culture of your organization.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, effective branding takes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Strategizing about who your company is,</li>
  <li>Aligning your brand with the your company&#8217;s core values,</li>
  <li>Creating an image and advertising that is distinctive, &amp;</li>
  <li>Integrating all media into an effective and memorable brand message.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basics of business branding. The most successful brands maintain 
  a consistent voice &#8211; in the media, on the web, and in person.</p>
<h3>What is a Brand Strategy?</h3>
<p>Brand strategy is the who, what, why, where, and how of branding. A well-crafted 
  brand strategy:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Captures your company&#8217;s personality</li>
  <li>Creates messaging that resonates with prospects</li>
  <li>Establishes your company&#8217;s competitive advantage</li>
  <li>Converts prospects&#8217; interest into revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>A good marketing firm with experience in your competitive niche can listen 
  to key employees (and even customers) to craft a message that clearly and succinctly 
  speaks to your target audience. It&#8217;s an important investment in your entire 
  marketing effort &#8211; and will make your future advertising expenditures 
  powerful.</p>
<p>For a great example of a rebranding campaign that achieved these objectives, 
  consider Financial Marketing Solutions&#8217; creative work for FirstBank. These 
  concepts can be applied to any business in any industry.</p>
