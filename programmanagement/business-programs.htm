<h2>Introduction -- What's a Program?</h2>

<h3>Varying Uses of the Term &quot;Program&quot;</h3>
There are a wide variety of uses of the term &quot;program&quot;
in organizations. In it's most general
use, a program is a collection of organizational resources that
is geared to accomplish a certain major goal or set of goals.
(For those of you who read 
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/org_thry/org_thry.htm">Organizations (an Introduction)</a>, 
you'll recognize that this definition of
a program sounds like that of an organization and a system. A
program is an organization and a system.)</p>

<p>For-profits often use the term for very large business efforts
that have limited duration and a defined set of deliverables.
Or, a program might refer to an ongoing set of activities internal
to the organization, for example, a Total Quality Management Program,
Workplace Safety Program, the Space Program, etc.</p>

<p>(Program planning is usually (but not always) of a broader
scope than <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/projectmanagement/index.htm">Project Planning</a>.)</p>

<h3>Varying Uses of the Term &quot;Program&quot;</h3>
<p>There are a wide variety of uses of the term &quot;program&quot;
in organizations. In it's most general
use, a major program is a collection of organizational resources
that is geared to accomplish a certain major goal or set of goals.
(For those of you who read

<h3>Keeping Overall Perspective:
Programs are Systems
</h3>
<p>
Programs, like other organizations, can seem a highly confusing,
amorphous mass that is very hard to comprehend. It can be hard
to keep perspective. However, like an organization, a program
is a system with inputs, processes, outputs (tangibles) and outcomes
(impacts on customers) -- with ongoing feedback among the parts.
This systems perspective helps keep clarity about programs and
will help a great deal during program planning.</p>

<p>Program inputs are the various resources
needed to run the program, e.g., money, facilities, customers
(internal or external), employees, etc. The process is how the
program's products are delivered, e.g., products are provided
to internal or external customers (internal or external), customers
(internal or external) are served, etc. The outputs are the units
of service, e.g., number of customers (internal or external) served.
Outcomes are the impacts on the customers (internal or external)
who are receiving the products, e.g., increased quality of products
for customers (internal or external), enhanced safety in the workplace
for internal customers (internal or external), enhanced mental
health for customers (internal or external), etc.

<h2>6 Cornerstones for Solid Program Planning </h2>

With these cornerstones in
place, the organization is assured of a program plan that has
a strong foundation and can survive multiple changes as the program
develops.
</p>

<h3>Program Should Tie to the Organization's Mission </h3>
<p>
Each program should be strongly associated with the organization's
overall mission. That is, the organization's executive leaders
should work from the mission to identify several overall, major
goals that must be reached and that, in total, reach the mission.
If an idea for a program comes up at some time other than during
strategic planning, executive leaders must ask themselves if the
program is really appropriate for the organization.</p>

<h3>Program Planning Should Tie
in With Strategic Planning
</h3>
<p>
Depending on the nature of the organization, strategic planning
typically includes review of the organization's vision, mission,
values, overall strategic issues and strategic goals (each of
which, in some organizations, becomes a program) and strategies
to reach the goals (strategies to reach the goals often are the
roadmap for how the program meets its own goals). Because the
program planning must be tied to the nature of the organization's
mission, the program planning should be closely tied with the
organization strategic planning as well. Typically, at a point
right after the strategic planning process has identified strategic
goals and issues, a team of planners can draft a framework for
how goals can be met. This framework is often the roadmap for
a new program. (For more information about strategic planning,
see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic
Planning</a>.)
</p>

<p>(Note that programs should not be
ongoing means to fix problems in the organization -- otherwise,
they become just that: ongoing, costly means to fix problems in
the workplace.)
</p>

<h3>Involve the Board (relevant
to corporations)
</h3>
<p>
A major responsibility of a board is to set strategic direction
for the corporation. The corporation's board should be highly
involved in authorizing and guiding initial direction for programs.
Therefore, boards should be involved in strategic planning of
programs. (Admittedly, many experienced chief executives might
argue that they actually drive the board to conduct strategic
planning. Many experienced chief executives, consultants, and
other practitioners believe that ultimately, it's the working
relationship of the board and chief executive that determines
the success of a corporation.)</p>

<h3>Conduct Program Planning as a Team</h3>
<p>
The chief executive, key planners, relevant middle managers and
major customers (internal or external) should be involved in program
planning. (&quot;Relevant middle managers&quot; are those who
lead programs or other departments that will integrate or coordinate
with the new program being planned.) Often, initial plans for
a program are suggested to the chief executive and middle managers.
Program planning is often initiated as part of the organization's
overall strategic planning process and so is conducted by the
strategic planning team, which should be comprised of the board
(in corporations), the chief executive, employee and key customers
(internal or external), as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Planning Should Involve Potential
Internal/External Customers as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>
One can embark on a wonderful program planning process with all
the right parts, but if key customers (internal or external) aren't
involved to provide perspectives from the program user's point
of view, the organization may build a beautiful ladder -- but
on the wrong roof. Involve customers (internal or external) in
initial ideas about a program, discuss your perceived unmet need
among those customers (internal or external), ask how they would
like the need to be met. You might run a final draft of your program
plan past a couple of key customers (internal or external). (Note
that this involvement of customers (internal or external) is a
critical aspect of the marketing process. For more about marketing,
see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/index.htm">Marketing (research,
pricing, competitor analysis, etc.)</a>.)
</p>

<h3>Don' Worry About Developing
the Perfect Program Plan </h3>
<p>
If the organization involves the right people, and if everyone
participates wholeheartedly and reflects on their experiences,
then the organization will develop the &quot;perfect&quot; plan.
The organization remains the only real &quot;expert&quot; on their
own planning. Outside consultants and facilitators can be brought
in, but each planning decision is ultimately up to the organization
members. The &quot;perfect&quot; program plan will meet the nature
and needs of the organization. <br />
<br />

<a name="anchor4294892756"></a>
<h2>8 Guidelines to Keep Program Planning on Track</h2>

Basically, planning is taking
one's best shot at working through a &quot;tree&quot; of decisions
(decisions that must be made at some time, and the earlier the
better) to propose (and often get /investing/funding for) developing
a program. Your plan doesn't have to be perfect and, like any
plan, it isn't a rule, rather it's a set of guidelines that serve
as reference for the future. You can change your plans -- just
know why and be able to explain (e.g., to your board, chief executives,
investors) why you changed the plans. This planning effort is
almost always more than personnel want to undertake, but is almost
always less than they fear. Anyway, this planning effort is required
if the organization plans to pursue investment/funding. The following
guidelines will help ensure the program planning process points
in the right direction and will help ensure the resulting program
is run effectively and efficiently. (For more information about
planning, see
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm">General
Planning Process</a>.)
</p>

<h3>Focus on Results/Outcomes</h3>
<p>
Results/outcomes are benefits to customers (internal or external)
from the program. Outcomes are usually in terms of solutions,
enhanced learning (knowledge, perceptions/attitudes or skills)
or conditions, e.g., increased productivity. Outcomes are often
confused with program outputs or units of services, e.g., the
number of customers (internal or external) served by the program.</p>

<h3>Examine Your Intended Results/Outcomes
- Conduct Some Basic Marketing</h3>
<p>
It's critical to verify that these planned results/outcomes are
indeed useful to your customers (internal or external). Many people
mistakenly believe that marketing is selling a product or idea
-- selling is only part of marketing. Sound marketing includes
researching a market to identify its needs or to assess if an
idea you already have is really needed by that market. (A market
is a group of people or organizations that may buy or need your
program's results/outcomes). Basically, you're verifying there's
a group of customers (internal or external) who are interested
in, or even better, really need your planned product. Marketing
also includes working with customers (internal or external) to
identify how they prefer to have the product delivered. Marketing
gives a strong impression of how much they're willing to accept
or pay for this product/service -- or what to set the price at
for the product/service.</p>

<p>Marketing also involves promoting
and advertising the product/service to internal or external customers.
For more information about marketing, see
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/index.htm">Marketing
(research, pricing, competitor analysis, etc.)</a>.)
</p>

<h3>Coordinate the New Program with
Other Current Programs</h3>
<p>
So often, in the excitement of the birth of a new program, we
ignore precious resources that already exist. The new program
is but part of an overall organization, an overall system. Pay
particular attention to how the new program will coordinate with
other programs in the organization. What inputs are needed from
other managers and other programs? What ongoing feedback is needed
among members of the new program and other programs? How can the
new program benefit other programs?</p>

<h3>Explore if Results Can Be Delivered
More Effectively via Collaboration
</h3>
<p>
Successful collaboration brings two or more organizations together
to work in synergy, in an effort that is &quot;more than the sum
of its parts.&quot; That is, if both organizations worked apart,
both would serve customers (internal or external) and produce
some solutions/outcomes -- but not as many and as well as if both
organizations worked together. In working together, there's an
economy of scale, or sharing of resources, that lowers costs and
focuses more resources on serving customers.</p>

<h3>Plan Key Indicators of Program Success</h3>
<p>
These planned indicators will help you establish whether the program
is successful or not, and will help you avoid doing a program
for the sake of a program. Consider planning indicators associated
with intended results/outcomes. Programs are usually defined with
very explicit deliverables.</p>

<p>If you struggle with identifying key
indicators of success, then imagine the program operating in a
highly successful manner at some time in the future. Then describe
what features of the program indicate that the program is successful.
</p>

<h3>Include Short-Range Focus in
a Long-Range Plan</h3>
<p>
Getting the program off on the right foot includes not falling
over your own feet because you were looking far off into the distance.
Many strategic plans are usually three years in scope, with particular
planning focus on the first year of the three years. Follow this
format for the program planning as well. Don't worry about exhaustive
detail even in the first year of the plan. Plans are guidelines,
not rules. Plans can be changed -- but understand why you changed
them.</p>

<h3>Learn by &quot;Testing the Waters&quot;</h3>
<p>Consider planning a short-term &quot;pilot&quot; program. The
pilot will be a sort of mini-program that will reflect many of
the aspects of a full-blown program. However, planning and operations
regarding the pilot will include numerous reviews and assessments
from which to learn from experiences around the pilot program.
This learning will go into planning for the full-blown program.
Note that investors are often highly cooperative in supporting
pilots as an approach to research or verify the organization's
proposed plans.</p>

<h3>Plan Program Reviews</h3>
<p>
Program reviews are regular examinations of the program's activities
to assess how well the program is doing. A program review team
should probably include the chief executive, the head of the new
program and one or two other program directors, particularly those
from programs that closely coordinate with the new program. Examine
if the program seems to be following the original plan. If it's
not, the deviation is not as important as understanding why and
assessing if the deviation was necessary. Take a look at the key
indicators as noted in the plan. What is the progress toward the
key indicators? What major problems exist and what is needed to
address them? How are the actual costs comparing to the planned
costs? Are any actions needed to avoid financial problems? What
would you do differently about the program if you could do anything?
What limitations are holding you back from what you would ideally
do if you could? What are you learning from the program implementation
so far? <br />
<br />

<h2>Program
Direction: Goals and Objectives</h2>
<h3>Program Goals</h3>
Program goal(s) should come from and be closely associated with
the organization's overall strategic goals. Think about what,
e.g., three to five major accomplishments must be reached to attain
each overall goal. Goals are an overall status to be reached through
continued efforts in the program. Goals should be described such
that the organization can assess whether it's reached the goal
or not. The goal should establish clear direction for the organization
and portray that direction to others. The program's goal may be
to fix a problem or meet a need among customers (internal or external)
-- not to fix a problem in your organization.</p>

<p>For example, if you are just starting
out to develop a new program, typical overall goals might include:
develop employees, pilot services to one group of customers (internal
or external), evaluate the program process and finalize program
process based on evaluation results.
</p>

<h3>Program Objectives
</h3>
<p>
Think about each goal and what sub-goals, or objectives, you need
to accomplish to reach that goal. (Depending on your nature, it
may work to instead think of how the program process will be carried
out and then identify specific milestones, or objectives, in carrying
out the process. This approach is somewhat like the reverse of
thinking about goals and associating objectives.)Objectives
should be worded such that one can rather easily discern if it's
been reached or not. They should specify who is going to do what
to whom and when and how much.</p>

<p>For example, referring to the above
goals, associated objectives might be: recruit employees, train
them, obtain facilities and equipment, install the equipment,
develop advertising materials, distribute the materials, recruit
customers (internal or external) for the pilot, develop procedures
for delivery of products/services, deliver products/services over
a fixed period of time, conduct evaluation of the program's process
and results/outcomes, generate recommendations from the evaluation,
update policies and procedures in the program's process, and update
the overall program plan. <br />
<br />

<a name="anchor4294895830"></a>
<h2>Program
Process, Resources and Budget</h2>
<h3>Program Process</h3>
By now, establishing the program's process should be quite straightforward
and depend mostly on the nature of the product/service provided
by the program. Program planners' thoughts about the processes
needed to reach each of the program objectives (above) often culminate
in the overall program process as well. After documenting the
planned general process for the program, take time to reflect
on whether that process will really accomplish the results/outcomes
you set out to accomplish for your customers (internal or external).</p>

<h3>Program Resources and Budget
</h3>
<p>
Examine the program's process to the extent that you can associate
what resources are needed to carry out that process. Consider:
personnel costs (salaries and wages, fringe benefits, consultants),
training, space, equipment purchase or rental, travel, copier,
telephone, general office supplies, etc. </p>
<p>
Develop a program budget by estimating the cost for each resource
identified above. Note that this budgeting activity is almost
always required in a proposal if the organization wants to find
an investor for the new program. <br />
<br />

<a name="anchor4294896934"></a>
<h2>Program
Evaluation</h2>
Programs should be evaluated on
at least a yearly basis to discern if the programs are reaching
their goals, achieving their outcomes and if they are doing so
in an efficient manner. Small businesses seldom have the resources
to conduct evaluations of a program's goals, outcomes and process.
However, they can think about where they have the most concerns
about a program and then gear an evaluation to look at that aspect
of the program.
</p>

<p>Program evaluation holds numerous
advantages. It can verify or increase the results/outcomes on
customers (internal or external). It can fine tune delivery of
program services, which, in turn, saves costs and time. Evaluations
often provide wonderful testimonials that can be used for public
relations and credibility of the program. In fact, evaluations
are often used by program planners to ensure that the program
is indeed carrying out the original process planned for the program
in the first place. Often, the program plan ends up changing dramatically
over time as program employees are overcome by events. Program
processes can naturally deviate from the original plan because
program plans were flawed in the first place, the program's environment
changed a great deal or program employees simply found a much
better way to deliver products/services to customers (internal
or external). For more information about program evaluations,
their planning and how to carry them out, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm">Program
Evaluation</a>, including the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-planning.htm">Program
