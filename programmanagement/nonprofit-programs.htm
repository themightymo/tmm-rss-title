<h2>WHAT'S A NONPROFIT PROGRAM?</h2>

<h2>Resources and Activities Organized to Provide Related Services</h2>

<p>Basically, a nonprofit program is a highly integrated set of
resources and activities geared to provide a service or closely
related set of services to clients. The typical nonprofit organizational
structure is built around programs. (Two other major aspects of
the nonprofit structure are its governance (the board and, for
some, the chief executive, too) and its central administration.
The board oversees the entire nonprofit organization. The central
administration exists to use the nonprofit's common resources
to ensure each program is developed and operated effectively.)</p>

<p>Programs are not the same as activities!!! Many nonprofits
have activities, not programs. The following article describes
the difference:<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/Programs-What-Are-and-Are-Not.pdf"
target="_blank">What Nonprofit Programs Are -- and Are Not</a><br />
</p>

  structures and nature, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/index.htm">Overview
  of Nonprofit Organizations</a> at http://managementhelp.org/organizations/index.htm)
</ul>

<h2>Program &quot;System&quot;: Inputs, Processes, Outputs and
Outcomes</h2>

<p>Programs, like other organizations, can seem a highly confusing,
amorphous mess that is very hard to comprehend. It can be hard
to keep perspective. However, like the overall organization itself,
a program is a system with inputs, processes, outputs (tangibles)
and outcomes (impacts on clients) -- with ongoing feedback among
these parts. This systems perspective helps keep clarity about
programs and will help a great deal during program planning.</p>

<p>Program inputs are the various resources needed to run the
program, e.g., money, facilities, clients, program staff, volunteers,
etc. The processes are how program services are delivered, e.g.,
clients are counseled, children are cared for, art is created,
association members are supported, etc. The outputs are the units
of service, e.g., number of clients counseled, children cared
for, artistic pieces produced, or members in the association.
Outcomes are the impacts on the clients who are receiving the
services, e.g., increased mental health, safe and secure development,
richer artistic appreciation and perspectives in life, increased
effectiveness among members, etc. The outcomes are the &quot;compass&quot;
for the program and help it keep its direction. This is why funders
are increasingly requesting outcomes-based evaluations from nonprofits.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>PREPARATION -- CORNERSTONES TO SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM PLANNING</h2>

<p>With the following cornerstones in place, the nonprofit is
assured of a program plan that has a strong foundation and can
survive multiple changes as the program develops.</p>

<h2>Program Should Be Closely Aligned with Organization's Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of the organization is its overall purpose in the
community. During strategic planning, planners work from the mission
to identify several overall, major (or strategic) goals that must
be reached and that, in total, work toward the mission. Each program
is associated with achieving one or more strategic goals and,
therefore, should contribute directly toward the mission as well.
If an idea for a program comes up at some time other than during
the strategic planning process, nonprofit board members must carefully
ask themselves if the program is really appropriate to the mission
of the organization.</p>

<h2>Program Planning Should Be Closely Aligned With Strategic
Planning</h2>

<p>Depending on the nature of the organization, strategic planning
typically includes review of the organization's vision, mission,
values, overall issues and goals. Goals associated with services
to clients often become program(s) and strategies to reach those
goals often become methods of delivering services in the programs.
Because programs must be tied closely to the nature of the organization's
mission and its goals, the program planning process should also
be closely aligned to the organization's strategic planning process
as well. Typically, at a point right after the strategic planning
process has identified strategic goals and issues, a team of planners
can draft a framework for how strategic goals can be met. This
framework is often the roadmap for a new program.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about strategic planning, see <a
  class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic
  Planning</a> at http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm</li>
</ul>

<p>Nonprofits must strive to keep down overhead costs, which are
often interpreted as the costs of central administration. Therefore,
avoid developing programs to fix recurring administrative problems
in the workplace.</p>

<h2>Involve Board Members in Program Planning</h2>

<p>A major responsibility of board members is to set the strategic
direction for their nonprofit. Therefore, board members should
be highly involved in the strategic and program planning processes
in the nonprofit. However, staff members might be strongly involved
in determining how services will actually be delivered in the
program.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor579041">roles
  and responsibilities of board</a>, see http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm#anchor579041
</ul>

<h2>Conduct Program Planning as a Team</h2>

<p>The chief executive, key planners on the board, relevant middle
managers and representatives from major client groups should all
be involved in program planning. (&quot;Relevant middle managers&quot;
are those who lead programs or other departments that will integrate
or coordinate with the new program being planned.) As mentioned
above, program planning is often initiated as part of the organization's
overall strategic planning process and so is often conducted by
the strategic planning team.</p>

<h2>Program Planning Should Involve Potential Clients as Much
as Possible</h2>

<p>One can embark on a wonderful program planning process with
all the right parts, but if key clients aren't involved to provide
perspectives from the program user's point of view, the organization
may build a beautiful ladder -- but on the wrong roof. Therefore,
involve clients as much as possible in initial ideas for a program.
Discuss with them your perceptions of their unmet needs. Try verify
if these needs actually exist and how they would like their needs
to be met. You might have representatives from client groups review
the final draft of your program plan. Note that this involvement
of clients is a critical aspect of the marketing process, specifically
marketing research.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about marketing research, see <a
  class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm">Marketing
  Research</a> at http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm</li>
</ul>

<h2>Don' Worry About Developing &quot;Perfect&quot; Program Plan</h2>

<p>If the organization involves the right people, everyone participates
wholeheartedly and continues to reflect on their experiences,
then the organization will develop the &quot;perfect&quot; plan
for the organization's programs. The organization remains the
only real &quot;expert&quot; on their own planning. Outside consultants
and facilitators can be brought in, but each planning decision
is ultimately up to the organization members. The &quot;perfect&quot;
program plan will meet the nature and needs of the organization
and continue to be updated as organization members learn more
about meeting the needs of their clients.</p>


<hr align="left" />
<a name="anchor4294892756"></a>

<h2>PLANNING YOUR PROGRAM AND SERVICES</h2>

<p>Basically, planning is taking one's best shot at working up
a &quot;tree&quot; of decisions (decisions that must be made at
some time, and the earlier the better) to propose (and often get
funding for) developing a program. Your plan doesn't have to be
perfect and, like any plan, it isn't a rule, rather it's a set
of guidelines that serve as reference for the future. You can
change your plans -- just know why and be able to explain (e.g.,
to your board and funder) why you changed the plans. This planning
effort is almost always more than nonprofit personnel want to
undertake, but is almost always less than they fear.</p>

<h2>Program Framework: Outcomes, Goals, Strategies and Objectives</h2>

<h3>Program Outcomes, Goals and Strategies Follow Directly from
Strategic Planning</h3>

<p>If your strategic planning was done thoroughly then it should
be relatively easy to determine program outcomes, goals and strategies.
The strategic planning process determines the mission (or purpose)
of the organization in terms of uniquely accomplishing certain
outcomes for specific groups of clients. The process also determines
the goals needed to work towards the mission and the general methods
(or strategies) to reach the goals. As much as possible, goals
are specified in terms to meet specific needs among specific groups
of clients.</p>

<p>The overall goals of the organization very much determine whom
you want to serve, that is, who your target markets will be. For
example, strategic goals might be to expand the number of clients
you have now, get new clients, get more revenue from current clients,
etc. You may want to develop new services in a current or new
market, or expand current services in a current or new market.
These examples of strategic goals greatly determine who your target
markets will be.</p>

<p>(NOTE: Don't be overly concerned about completely understanding
correct definitions of the terms in this section. As long as your
program planning proceeds directly from aspects of your strategic
planning, you'll be headed in the right direction. You might consider
goals as measurable accomplishments and objectives as smaller,
measurable milestones along the way to the goals. Consider strategies
as methods to reach the goals or objectives.)</p>

<h3>Program Outcomes</h3>

<p>We've noted above that intended outcomes are always the compass
to point direction for nonprofits and their programs.Outcomes
are benefits to clients from participation in the program. Outcomes
are usually in terms of enhanced learning (knowledge, perceptions/attitudes
or skills) or conditions, for example, increased literacy, self-reliance,
certifications, etc. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example Outcome #1 -- Drop-outs from Minneapolis high schools
  obtain high school diplomas or equivalent levels of certification</li>
  <li>Example Outcome #2 -- Within three months after getting certification,
  participants obtain at least half-time employment or enroll in
  an accredited program to further their education</li>
  <li>For more information now about outcomes, see the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.unitedway.org/outcomes/"
  target="_blank">United Way.</a> site at http://www.unitedway.org/outcomes/
</ul>

<h3>Program Goals</h3>

<p>Programs goals should follow directly from, or be the same
as, strategic service goals intended to meet specific needs of
specific client groups. (Note that there are also strategic goals
other than for meeting needs of clients, for example, getting
a facility.)</p>

<p>Goals should specify the results from program services and
be in terms that are &quot;SMARTER&quot; (an acronym), that is,
specific, measurable, acceptable to those working to achieve the
goals, realistic, timely, extending the capabilities of those
working to achieve the goals and rewarding for them, as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example Program Goal #1: Support at least 600 drop-outs from
  Minneapolis high schools to obtain diplomas or equivalent levels
  of certification</li>
</ul>

<h3>Program Strategies</h3>

<p>Program strategies (or methods to reach goals) should follow
directly from strategies intended to achieve each strategic goal,
for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example Program Strategy 1.1 -- Conduct high-school equivalency
  training programs to drop-outs from Minneapolis high schools</li>
  <li>Example Program Strategy 1.2 -- Provide free transportation
  to enrollees in the program</li>
  <li>Example Program Strategy 1.3 -- Provide subsidized child
  care to enrollees in the program</li>
</ul>

<h3>Program Objectives</h3>

<p>Program objectives (or specific, measurable milestones along
the way to achieving program goals) are accomplished along the
way while implementing the above strategies, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example Objective 1.2.1: Provide three vans that will each
  transport eight riders per day (enrollees and/or their children)
  to and from the program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Designing Each Service in Program (Through Market Analysis)</h2>

<p>Developing program services is not unlike developing products
or services in the for-profit market, particularly as nonprofits
look to more innovative methods to earn revenue from products
and services. Nonprofit services must be marketed, including clarifying
which client groups the nonprofit is going to serve( these are
target markets), verifying their needs (a basic form of market
research), analyzing competitors (nonprofits do have competitors)
and potential collaborators, determining the best fee for services,
determining how to produce and distribute the services, and how
to promote (advertise, manage public image and sell) the services,
as well.</p>

<h3>Draft Basic Description of Each of Your Services</h3>

<p>Typically, a service is a closely related set of activities
that accomplishes a specific benefit for clients. Exactly what
determines a service in an organization is highly unique to the
organization itself. A program can have several services. A nonprofit
might sell services separately and/or in a package of related
services. For example, from the above example outcome #1, services
might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example Service for Outcome #1 -- High-school training services</li>
  <li>Example Service for Outcome #1 -- Transportation services</li>
  <li>Example Service for Outcome #1 -- Child-care services</li>
</ul>

<p>By now, you might have a strong, clear sense of what each of
your services are. At this point, you might draft for yourself
a written description of each of your services. The description
should include: nature of your services (arts, social services,
education, etc.), the specific groups of clients served by the
service, outcomes for them, other benefits to them and where they
should go next if they are interested in using the service. Be
careful to describe the services in terms of benefits to clients,
not to you. For example, address pricing, convenience, location,
quality, service, atmosphere, etc.</p>

<h3>What Major Groups of Clients Do You (or Do You Want to) Serve?
(Target Markets and Customer Profiles)</h3>

<p><i>This paragraph is repeated from above:</i> The overall goals
of the organization very much determine whom you want to serve.
For example, strategic goals might be to expand the number of
clients you have now, get new clients, get more revenue from current
clients, etc. You may want to develop new services in a current
or new market, or expand current services in a current or new
market. These examples of strategic goals greatly determine who
your target markets will be.</p>

<p>Understanding your program's target markets makes it much easier
for you to ensure that your program remains highly effective.
In addition to helping focus the results and evaluation of your
services, understanding your target markets helps you to focus
on where to promote your services, including advertising, conducting
public relations campaigns and selling your services. If you've
done a good job so far of strategic planning and program planning,
then identifying the primary targets market should be fairly straightforward.
However, it is very useful to determine several additional target
markets. These additional markets are often where you should focus
promotions and mean additional sources of assistance and revenue.
For example, a target market that follows from the above examples,
might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Target Market #1: Dropouts from Minneapolis high schools</li>
  <li>Target Market #2: Counselors in Minneapolis high schools</li>
  <li>Target Market #3: Parents of drop-outs from Minneapolis schools</li>
  <li>Target Market #4: Job placement services, seeking to help
  people find jobs</li>
  <li>Target Market #5: Local businesses looking for employees</li>
</ul>

<p>The more you know about your clients, the better you might
be at serving them. At this point, write down a customer profile,
or description of the groups of clients (or markets) who will
use your services. Consider, for example, their major needs, how
they prefer to have their needs met, where they are and where
they prefer to have their needs met and demographics information
(their age ranges, family arrangement, education levels, income
levels, typical occupations, major interested, etc).</p>

<ul>

  target="_blank">How to Identify a Target Market and Prepare a
  Customer Profile</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>What Needs Do Your Services Meet for Each Target Market?</h3>

<p>By now, you should have clear idea of the major needs met by
each of your services for their primary (or #1) target market.
It's critical that you have strong sense of the needs that your
services are providing to clients. The services should be described
in terms that are beneficial to clients -- what's in it for them?
Consider: what needs of theirs are being met, low pricing, convenience,
quality, atmosphere, location, etc.</p>

<p>What needs might your services meet among other markets as
well? For example, in the above examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Needs Met for Target Market #1: High school graduation, eligibility
  for job and further education</li>
  <li>Needs Met for Target Market #2: Place to refer high school
  drop-outs so they can continue their education</li>
  <li>Needs Met for Target Market #3: Place to refer their children
  for continued training, transportation and child care</li>
  <li>Needs Met for Target Market #4: Place to get clients to find
  jobs for</li>
  <li>Needs Met for Target Market #5: Place to get job candidates</li>
  <li>Note that identifying the needs of target markets is a major
  aspect of the marketing process, specifically marketing research.

  Research</a> at http://managementhelp.org/marketing/market-research.htm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Are Your Competitors?</h3>

<p>Nonprofits exist to serve their communities. One would think
that in this spirit of service, all nonprofits should collaborate
for &quot;the common good&quot;. However, nonprofits do compete
for the attention, participation and money of their clients --
and in many cases, compete for the same items from funders. Consider
the following questions: Who are your competitors? What client
needs are you competing to meet? What are the similarities and
differences between their products/services and yours? What are
the strengths and weaknesses of each of their products and services?
How do their prices compare to yours? How are they doing overall?</p>

<p>How do you plan to compete? Offer better quality services?
Lower prices? More support? Easier access to services?</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/competitors.htm">competitor
  analysis</a>, see http://managementhelp.org/marketing/competitors.htm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Are Your Collaborators?</h3>

<p>Successful collaboration brings two or more organizations together
to work in synergy, in an effort that is &quot;more than the sum
of its parts.&quot; That is, if both organizations worked apart,
both would serve clients and produce some benefits -- but not
as many and as well as if both organizations worked together.
In working together, there's an economy of scale, or sharing of
resources, that lowers costs and focuses more resources on serving
clients.</p>

<p>An increasing number of funders are requiring evidence of collaboration
planning from nonprofits applying for funding. Many nonprofit
leaders naturally struggle with the notion of collaboration, of
sharing resources and control with other organizations. Collaboration
can be viewed as quite frustrating for nonprofit leaders. This
dilemma invites leaders to carefully consider whom it is that
they really want to serve. If collaboration will better serve
clients (and it usually will) and better serving clients is the
overall goal, then collaboration should be attempted.</p>

<p>In this analysis, consider: Who are potential collaborators
with your nonprofit? What client needs might you collaborate to
meet? What resources might they bring and what could you bring?
What could you do next to cultivate collaboration with other agencies?</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/alliances/index.htm">organizational
  alliances</a>, see http://managementhelp.org/alliances/index.htm</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Price Should You Charge?</h3>

<p>Nonprofit typically don't place the same high priority on setting
prices that for-profits do. However, funders won't support a program
indefinitely. The nonprofit is always wise to explore what revenue
can be generated from a service to offset its operating costs.
Nonprofits that rely on federal funding would be wise to plan
programs that recover costs through the use of fees because the
federal government is substantially reducing its contributions
to nonprofits.</p>

<p>Several major factors influence the pricing for a service.
Strategic goals greatly influence pricing. For example, if the
nonprofit really wants to get into a new market, then it might
charge lower than usual prices in order to generate more clients
who buy the service. The nonprofit might consider changing pricing
if the demand for its services are very high or low. Competitor
pricing also has a great effect. If competitors are charging much
less, then the nonprofit might do well to lower prices. Similarly,
if the competitor is charging much more, then the nonprofit might
consider increasing its own prices.</p>

<p>In this pricing analysis, consider: Is your nonprofit recouping
your costs (time, money, materials, etc.) to provide it? Is it
affordable to clients? Would a sliding-fee scale better? What
about volume discounts? What is the competition charging? What
should be the new fee(s), if any? How do you know?</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/pricing.htm">Pricing</a>,
  see http://managementhelp.org/marketing/pricing.htm </li>
</ul>

<h3>What Laws and Regulations Must You Follow?</h3>

<p>It's critical to identify all laws and regulations that effect
how you carry out your particular services. Contact local state
agencies to determine these laws and regulations, for example,
offices of your states attorney or attorney general, secretary
of state, etc.</p>

<h3>What Name Will You Use for Your Service?</h3>

<p>To effectively promote your service, you must have a concise,
yet meaningful description of the service. This can be much more
complicated than merely picking a name. There are consultancies
built around helping organizations to name or brand their products
and services. You have to be sure that you're not using a name
that is already trademarked or servicemarked. You should not have
a name that closely resembles an already established name in your
area, or clients will confuse your services with those referred
to by the other name -- or, the organization with the other name
may choose to sue you. You need a name that makes sense locally,
but if you grow, the name will still be understood elsewhere.
The name you choose for your service will be around for a long
time and can have substantial impact on your services are perceived.
Therefore, seriously consider some basic forms of market research
to glean impressions of different names. For example, convene
several focus groups to glean their reactions to various names.
Have survey cards that clients can complete to suggest names.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/branding.htm">Naming
  and Branding</a>, see http://managementhelp.org/marketing/branding.htm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protect Your Creations with Copyrights, Trademarks/Servicemarks
and/or Patents?</h3>

<p>You may want to legally protect the unique combination of ideas,
innovations, processes and materials (that is, the &quot;intellectual
property&quot;) that produce the products and services of your
nonprofit. Communities usually expect nonprofits to operate in
the spirit of complete support for the common good of the community.
For some people, this expectation might include that the intellectual
property of nonprofits should be owned by everyone in the community,
as well. Thus, these people might believe that a nonprofit should
not seek to legally own -- and/or seek to be reimbursed for duplication
of -- its products and services. However, even if a nonprofit
does not seek to be paid for duplication of its products and services,
the nonprofit should seek to protect the integrity of its products
and services, including that their names not be used for other
similar products and services and/or that other, poorer quality
products and services not be confused with the products and services
of the nonprofit. Therefore, the nonprofit should carefully consider
legal protection of its intellectual property. Copyright law protects
original &quot;works of authorship&quot;. Patent law protects
new inventions and processes. Trademark laws protects words, names
and symbols.</p>

<h3>Finalize Description of Each of Your Services</h3>

<p>At this point, you've thought -- and hopefully learned -- more
about each of your nonprofit's services. You've learned more about
the service's target markets, benefits to clients, competitors,
collaborators, pricing and naming. Now go back to your drafted
description of each of your services and update the descriptions
with what you've learned. Include description of:<br />
1. The business you're in, for example, service, manufacturing,
etc.<br />
2. The type of your service, for example, arts, advocacy, social
services, education, civic, cultural, etc.<br />
3. The target market for the service. Include description of the
target market. <br />
4. Include your strategies regarding pricing, distribution, advertising
and promotion strategies, etc.</p>

<h2>Planning Program Promotions (Advertising, Public Relations
and Sales)</h2>

<p>Promotion keeps your service in the minds of your clients and
helps stimulate demand for your services. Promotion involves ongoing
advertising, public and media relations, and can include sales
and customer service. All of these build from having a clear idea
of how you want position your nonprofit and its services in the
target markets (or groups of clients) that you are aiming to serve.</p>

<h3>Positioning Your Nonprofit and Its Services -- the Positioning
Statement</h3>

<p>Simply put, positioning is determining how you want others
to perceive your nonprofit and/or each of its services. Positioning
builds from many of the above-mentioned activities, including
clarifying target markets, which of their needs your services
meet, how your services uniquely meets these needs, the price
of services, how your nonprofit &quot;stands up against&quot;
competitors, and the unique name of your services.</p>

<p>Your market position can be described by your positioning statement.
Advertising and promotions often work from this positioning statement.
This statement usually includes two to five sentences, but should
be very brief and concise. It should clearly depict your organization
in the way that you want others to perceive it. When writing it
down, consider answers to the question: &quot;We are the nonprofit
that ...&quot;</p>

<h3>Sales Planning</h3>

<p>Sales can be a strong component of your advertising and promotions
activities. In addition, the budget for advertising and promotions
is often determined as a percentage of the revenue expected from
sales. Therefore, we'll look at sales at this point in the advertising
and promotions information.</p>

<p>Sales involves most or many of the following activities, including
cultivating prospective buyers (or leads) in a market segment;
conveying the features, advantages and benefits of a service to
the lead; and closing the sale (or coming to agreement on pricing
and services). Sales forecasts (or projections about sales accomplished
in terms of money made, units sold, etc.) are often used as the
basis for determining how much to budget for advertising and promotions
and for public relations efforts. Sales forecasts are often made
on the basis of market research about the market and industry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people in nonprofits have strong feelings
against sales. They perceive sales as heavy-handed and manipulative
efforts to force someone to do something that they really don't
want to do. However, sales is evolving from this old-fashioned,
heavy-handed approach to more relationship-based approaches geared
toward identifying the needs of clients and helping clients decide
if the services meet those needs. If a person really believes
strongly in their services, then sales can be very meaningful
experience. It's often wise to send personnel to basic forms of
sales training. This can make a big difference.</p>

<p>The best sales techniques usually include strong skills in
questioning and listening. Good sales techniques also include
ensuring strong methods of customer service -- current customers
are often the best sources of customers for new products and services.
Probably the best approach to ensuring strong sales is knowing
the needs of clients -- this starts with effective market research.</p>

<p>Regarding your sales planning, consider: What target markets
will be approached? How will you conduct sales efforts with them?
How much do you expect to accomplish in sales (consider terms
of outputs, such as dollars made, clients recruited, or other
units of service). How do you generate sales contacts and potential
customers (or leads) among each target group? Who does follow-up
and presentations? Who actually closes the sale? How will you
know if your sales efforts are effective?</p>

<h3>Planning Your Advertising and Promotions</h3>

<p>Advertising and promotions is continuing to bring a service
to the attention of potential and current customers. Advertising
and promotions are best carried out by implementing an overall
advertising and promotions plan. The plan often includes plans
for a promotional campaign, including an advertising calendar
and media plan. The goals of the plans should depend very much
on the overall goals and strategies of the organization, and the
results of the marketing analysis, including the positioning statement.
Successful advertising and promotions depends very much on knowing
what target markets you want to reach, what features and benefits
you want to convey to each of them, what methods and media you
will use to convey it to them, who is responsible to implement
the methods and how much money is budgeted for this effort.</p>

<p>When selecting methods, consider what communications methods
and media will be most effective in reaching target markets and
when. Consider, for example, radio, newsletters, classifieds,
displays/signs, posters, word of mouth, press releases, direct
mail, special events, brochures, neighborhood newsletters, etc.
What media is most practical for you to use in terms of access
and affordability? You can often find out a lot about your clients
preferences just by conducting some basic market research methods.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Public and Media Relations Planning</h3>

<p>Public and media relations includes ongoing activities to ensure
the nonprofit has a strong public image. Public relations activities
include helping the public to understand the nonprofit and its
services. Similar to effective advertising and promotions, effective
public relations often depends on designing and implementing a
well-designed public relations plan. The plan often includes description
of what you want to convey to whom, methods to convey it, who
is responsible for implementing the methods and how much money
is budgeted to fund these activities. Similar to advertising and
promotions planning, a media plan and advertising calendar can
be very useful in a public relations plan, as well.</p>

<p>Often, public relations are conducted through the media, that
is, newspapers, television, magazines, etc. Publicity is mention
in the media. Organizations usually have little control over the
message in the media, at least, not as much as they do in advertising.
Regarding publicity, reporters and writers decide what will be
said.</p>

<p>Regarding public relations, consider: What groups of stakeholders
do we want to appeal to and how? What impressions do you want
each of your stakeholder to have? What communications media do
they see or prefer the most? Consider advertising, collaborations,
annual reports, networking, TV, radio, newsletters, classifieds,
displays/signs, posters, word of mouth, direct mail, special events,
brochures, neighborhood newsletters, etc. What media is most practical
for you to use in terms of access and affordability? What messages
are most appealing to each stakeholder group?</p>

</ul>

<p>Regarding media relations, consider: Who in your organization
should respond to calls from newspaper reporters, etc? What should
organization members say to the reporters? Do you have a script
that your organization can reference to represent the organization
to the community? Do you have guidelines for writing press releases
and are these guidelines used?</p>

<h3>Customer Service</h3>

<p>The for-profit arena has seen dramatic improvements in customer
service as customers become more discerning in their selection
of products and services (clients of nonprofit organizations are
also customers of the organization). Organizations are realizing
that the best source of customers for new products and services
are current customers -- if their needs are being met. As with
many other areas in this guide, the place to start when understanding
customer service may be some basic methods of market research.</p>

<p>When considering how you will ensure strong &quot;customer&quot;
services, consider: Are clients very satisfied with your services?
How do you know? If not, what can you do to improve customer service?
How can you do that? What policies and procedures are needed to
ensure strong customer service. Include training in your considerations,
including skills in interpersonal relations, such as questioning,
listening, handling difficult people, handling interpersonal conflicts,
negotiating.</p>

<h2>Planning Service Delivery Methods</h2>

<p>These methods are primarily in regard to building and reproducing
the service (producing it), and then bringing the particular target
market and service together (distributing the service). How your
nonprofit produces and distributes services depends very much
on the nature and needs of your organization and services. However,
there are some common questions you should address in your planning.</p>

<h3>Producing Each Service</h3>

<p>If your program planning and marketing is successful, then
hopefully you can expect an increase in demand for your services.
You consider the following questions: What resources are needed
to build the service? What resources are needed to reproduce the
service (that is, provide it multiple times)? How will you meet
expected demand for the services over the next six months? Twelve
months? Eighteen months?</p>

<p>Note that the development and implementation of various production
methods do not have to be addressed in detail in a marketing plan
-- these topics are usually included in the operations or management
planning for the program. However, production should be generally
considered during the marketing analysis to ensure the eventual
detailed production planning takes into consideration the needs
of target markets and having their needs met on time.</p>

<h3>Distributing Each Service</h3>

<p>Matters of distribution of service can be critical for nonprofits,
especially if they are providing critically needed services to
specific groups of clients. For example, low-income clients may
not be able to afford transportation to other areas to receive
your services.</p>

<p>Carefully consider: What distribution channels should you consider,
for example, should clients come to your facility, you visit their
offices, can you provide services over the telephone, etc? What
resources are needed to bring together your services and your
target markets? What major steps need to occur to accomplish these
distribution channels?</p>

<p>Note that detailed planning about developing and maintaining
distribution channels is often included in the operations or management
plans, rather than in the marketing plan. However, the marketing
analysis should focus on selecting the methods of distribution
that best meet the needs of target markets and the nonprofit.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Planning Methods to Measure Success of Program</h2>

<p>The best indicator of the success of a program is clear, continued
evidence that its services are meeting the previously unmet needs
of its clients. To clearly conclude this success of a program,
you need to clear indicators of success.</p>

<h3>Building In Key Indicators of Success</h3>

<p>It's important during program planning to build in clear indicators
of the success of the program. For example, consider establishing
indicators that are associated with outcomes intended from the
program, such as &quot;increased self-reliance (an outcome) for
70% of adult, African American women living in the inner city
of Minneapolis as evidenced by the following measures (indicators)
...&quot; An outcomes-based evaluation will help you ascertain
if you've reached this indicator or not. You can also resort to
indicators in terms of outputs (tangible results), for example,
the number of clients served, money made, milestones accomplished,
measures of satisfaction among clients per questionnaires, etc.
Note that measures of outputs are very weak indicators of the
success of achieving outcomes. As a result, many evaluators and
funders will assert that more valid measures toward outcomes must
be used.</p>

<p>If you struggle with identifying key indicators of success,
then imagine the program operating in a highly successful manner
at some time in the future. Then describe what features of the
program indicate that the program is successful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information now about program evaluations, their
  planning and how to carry them out, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm">Program
  Evaluation</a> at http://managementhelp.org/evaluation/program-evaluation-guide.htm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conducting Initial, Pilot of Program</h3>

<p>Consider planning a six-month or one-year pilot effort. The
pilot will be a sort of mini-program that will reflect many of
the aspects of a full-blown program. However, planning and operations
regarding the pilot will include numerous reviews and assessments
from which to learn from experiences around the pilot program.
This learning will go into planning for the full-blown program.
Note that funders are often highly cooperative in funding pilots
as an approach to research or verify the nonprofit's proposed
plans.</p>

<h3>Program Reviews</h3>

<p>Program reviews are regular examination of the program's activities
to assess how the program is doing. A program review team should
probably include the chief executive, the head of the new program
and one or two other program directors, particularly those from
programs that closely coordinate with the new program. A board
planner should be involved, if possible. Examine if the program
seems to be following the original plan. If it's not, the deviation
is not as important as understanding why and assessing if the
deviation was necessary. Take a look at the key indicators as
noted in the plan. What is the progress toward the key indicators?
What major problems exist and what is needed to address them?
How are the actual costs compared to the planned costs? Are any
actions needed to avoid financial problems? What would you do
differently about the program if you could do anything? What limitations
are holding you back from what you would ideally do if you could?
What are you learning from the program implementation so far?</p>

<h3>Evaluation of Plans (Marketing and Promotions, Public and
Media Relations and Sales)</h3>

<p>One of the most effective ways to ensure the success of your
program is by evaluating the implementation of the plan. The plans
are not law -- they're a set of guidelines and controls. If the
plans needs to be changed, then fine -- but know why they need
to be changed and how.</p>

<h4>Evaluate Progress Toward Goals and Objectives</h4>

<p>1. Are goals and objectives being achieved or not? If they
are, then acknowledge, reward and communicate the progress. If
not, then consider the following questions.<br />
2. Will the goals be achieved according to the timelines specified
in the plan? If not, then why?<br />
3. Should the deadlines for completion be changed (be careful
about making these changes -- know why efforts are behind schedule
before times are changed)?<br />
4. Do personnel have adequate resources (money, equipment, facilities,
training, etc.) to achieve the goals?<br />
5. Are the goals and objectives still realistic?<br />
6. Should priorities be changed to put more focus on achieving
the goals?<br />
7. Should the goals be changed (be careful about making these
changes -- know why efforts are not achieving the goals before
changing the goals)?<br />
8. What can be learned from our monitoring and evaluation in order
to improve future planning activities and also to improve future
monitoring and evaluation efforts?</p>

<h4>Evaluate Response from Clients</h4>

<p>For example, consider:<br />
1. Did customers respond to advertising and promotions?<br />
2. Did stakeholders respond with positive impression of the agency?<br />
3. Did customers respond stronger than expected in certain areas?<br />
4. What media seemed to generate the most responses?<br />
5. What else can be learned about how clients are responding to
the marketing efforts?</p>

<h3>Program Evaluations</h3>

<p>Programs should be evaluated on a regular basis to discern
if the programs are reaching their goals, achieving their outcomes
and if they are doing so in an efficient manner. Small nonprofits
seldom have the resources to conduct comprehensive, detailed evaluations
of a program's goals, outcomes and process. However, personnel
from small nonprofits can think about where they have the most
concerns about a particular program or aspect of a program (goals,
processes, outcomes, etc.) and then target a highly practical
evaluation of that particular aspect of the program.</p>

<p>Program evaluation holds numerous advantages. It can verify
or increase the impact (or outcomes) on constituents. It can fine
tune delivery of program services, which, in turn, saves costs
and time. Evaluations often provide wonderful client testimonials
that can be used for public relations and credibility when applying
for funding. In fact, evaluations are often used by program planners
to ensure that the program is indeed carrying out the original
process planned for the program in the first place. Often, nonprofit
leaders develop a program plan which ends up changing dramatically
over time as program staff are overcome by events. Program processes
can naturally deviate from the original plan because program plans
were flawed in the first place, the program's environment changed
a great deal or program staff simply found a much better way to
deliver services to clients.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Resourcing and Budgeting for Program Development</h2>

<h3>Program Resources and Budget</h3>

<p>Examine the program's process to the extent that you can associate
what resources are needed to carry out that process. Consider:
personnel costs (salaries and wages, fringe benefits, consultants),
training, space, equipment purchase or rental, travel, copier,
telephone, general office supplies, etc. <br />
Develop a program budget by estimating the cost for each resource
identified above. Note that this budgeting activity is almost
always required in a proposal if the nonprofit wants to pursue
funding for the new program.</p>
