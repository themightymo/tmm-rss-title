<h2><a name="learning" id="learning"></a>Are You Learning Everyday?</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.leadersatalllevels.com/" target="_blank">Marcia Zidle</a></p>
<p>Jack Nichlaus was asked if there are really talented golfers who never make 
  it. &#8220;Oh, hundreds of them&#8221;, he replied. &#8220;A lot of people out 
  there are more talented than I am and yet, through the years, I&#8217;ve passed 
  them by. That&#8217;s because I never was satisfied with my game. I was learning 
  new shots every single day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you to make sure you are continually improving, growing, and 
  learning every day. It&#8217;s up to you to make sure you never go out of style! 
  It&#8217;s up to you to take charge of your professional development. Here's 
  how.</p>
<h3>1. Have a learning perspective.</h3>
<p>Be on the lookout for teachable moments. Approach each learning experience, 
  whether you want to be there or not, with the questions: What can I learn? What 
  one or two things can I take away that I can use immediately? Who else would 
  find value in this learning?</p>
<h3>2. Benchmark your skills periodically.</h3>
<p>Do it at least once a year. For those in a fast moving profession or industry 
  every three months may be required. In other words, what&#8217;s in your work 
  portfolio? Is it filled with skills or competencies that are up-to-date and 
  sought after? Or, is it filled with skills which are obsolete and not very portable?</p>
<h3>3. Create a learning plan.</h3>
<p>Pinpoint specific skills and knowledge that you need to acquire or up-grade. 
  Then identify the professional development activities that are available to 
  you. They can include mentor relationships, special assignments at work, in-house 
  and public seminars, professional conferences, on-line courses, university education, 
  books, journals, blogs, etc.</p>
<p>Are you learning every day?</p>
<p>I hope so. If not, you may find yourself a professional dinosaur...out of touch, 
  out of skills and out of work. Just as a company invests in its own research 
  and development, you need to invest in your own career growth and development. 
  Remember, as you never outgrow your need for milk, you never outgrow your need 
  for professional development.</p>

<h3>Is Experience the Best Teacher?</h3>
<p>Yes, says The Center for Creative Leadership. Their research found that a variety 
  of challenging assignments contribute greatly to the building and seasoning 
  of new and emerging leaders.</p>
<p>However, not all challenges are equal. The ones that will enhance leadership 
  skills are those that:</p>
<p> Require working with new people or high variety or time pressures.<br />
  Call for influencing people with no or limited direct authority or control.<br />
  Involve building a team, starting something from scratch or solving a problem.<br />
  Demand a &#8220;take charge&#8221; attitude, quick learning, coping with uncertain 
  situations.</p>
<h3>Choose Your Challenges Wisely</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessary to change one&#8217;s job to build leadership capabilities. 
  Rather be on the lookout for or request these kinds of assignments, projects 
  or tasks. They are developmental. In other words, they will help you learn, 
  grow and lead more effectively.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Be part of a task force on a pressing business problem</li>
  <li>Handle a negotiation with a customer</li>
  <li>Present proposal report to top management</li>
  <li>Work short periods in other units or departments</li>
  <li>Plan an off site, meeting or conference</li>
  <li>Serve on a new project / product review committee</li>
  <li>Manage the visit of a VIP</li>
  <li>Go off-site to troubleshoot problems</li>
  <li>Take a board position at a community organization</li>
  <li>Be part of the company&#8217;s trade show booth team</li>
  <li>Redesign a work process with another function</li>
  <li>Resolve conflict among warring subordinates</li>
  <li>Take over a troubled project and get it back on track</li>
  <li>Manage projects requiring coordination across the organization</li>
  <li>Supervise assigned office space in a new building</li>
  <li>Spend a day with customers and write report</li>
  <li>Do postmortem on a failed project</li>
  <li>Evaluate the impact of training</li>
  <li>Write a proposal for a new system, product, etc.</li>
  <li>Interview outsiders on their view of the organization</li>
</ol>
<p>Pick one or two of the above professional development assignments that would 
  help you develop your leadership capabilities now.</p>
<h3>Career Success Tip</h3>
<p>You learn on the job every day. But are you learning what you really need to 
  learn to develop your leadership and advance your career? It&#8217;s up to you 
  to make sure you&#8217;re continually improving, growing and learning. It&#8217;s 
  up to you to take charge of your professional development.</p>
