<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Free Management Library can be freely used for your own
personal, professional and organizational development (including
for-profit and nonprofit organizations). It is updated regularly
with new topics, each focused on practical guidelines, tips and
tools you can apply -- and learn at the same time. To learn more
about the purpose, the information, some history and the developer
of the Library, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/what-it-is.htm"
class="textlink">What It Is</a>. Here are some tips to get the
most out of using the Library.</p>

<a name="anchor3316444"></a>
<h3>Primary Uses of the Library</h3>

<p>People use the Library, primarily for three purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To get to know it as a general purpose resource they can
  use over time.</li>
  <li>To find a specific type of resource to solve a current problem,
  achieve a goal or meet an interest.</li>
  <li>To develop personally, professionally or organizationally.</li>
</ol>

<p>Information in the following paragraphs gives guidelines for
each of these purposes.</p>

<a name="anchor3293039"></a>
<h3>For-Profit and Nonprofit Information</h3>

<p>You might be from a for-profit or nonprofit organization that
you want to improve. The Library includes information for both
for-profit and nonprofit organizations. To understand the differences
and how to translate Library content from one type of organization
to another, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/fp_np.htm"
class="textlink">Free Management Library Includes Materials for
For-Profit and Nonprofit Organizations</a>.</p>

<a name="anchor3326309"></a>
<h3>Translation to Different Languages</h3>

<p>A translation utility is available in the upper left-hand corner
of each page in the Library and near the upper left-hand corner
in each blog. It translates into almost 60 languages, using the
TranslateThis button, which, in turn, uses the Google translator
engine. As with any automated translator, there are often miss-translations.
While not as accurate and reliable as a human translator, the
automated utility does provide value to users of other languages.</p>

<a name="anchor3346209"></a>
<h3>To Get the Most Out of Any Topic</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In each of your preferred topic(s), first scan down the list
  of subtopics to get a sense of which subtopics are included in
  that overall topic and how those subtopics are organized together.
  You can often very quickly learn a lot about an overall topic
  that way. That's true especially for very broad topics, such
  as <a href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Boards</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm"
  class="textlink">Consultants</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/consulting.htm"
  class="textlink">Employee Performance Management</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Facilitation</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadership/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Leadership</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Marketing</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/projectmanagement/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Project Management</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Research Methods</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Staffing</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm"
  class="textlink">Training</a>.</li>
  <li>There are usually many links, or resources, in each topic
  and subtopic. In each, click on a few of the links -- pick the
  titles of links that most appeal to you.</li>
  <li>You also could pick a book or two from the list of recommended
  books at the bottom of each topic.</li>
  <li>If you want to further deepen your learning about a topic
  or subtopic, consider following a plan for learning. You could
  use a less formal and systematic approach to regularly write
  your learning in a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/journaling.htm"
  class="textlink">Learning Journal</a>. Or, you could follow a
  more formal approach by developing a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/guidelines-to-design-training.htm"
  class="textlink">Training Plan</a>. That Journal or Plan might
  benefit from considering your <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/learning-styles.htm"
  class="textlink">learning style</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personaldevelopment/setting-goals.htm"
  class="textlink">setting goals</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/leadingpeople/motivating-others.htm"
  class="textlink">motivating yourself</a> to achieve those goals.</li>
  <li>The addition of a learning plan can add more responsibilities
  to your life and work, so consider some guidelines from <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/time-stress-management.htm"
  class="textlink">time management</a> and <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalproductivity/time-stress-management.htm"
  class="textlink">stress management</a>, as you develop and implement
  your plan for learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Copyright Terms and Reprinting
Materials</h3>

<p>We want to help you to use the resources in the Library, including
to reprint articles where appropriate. Read <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/copyright.htm"
class="textlink">Copyright, Reprint</a> to see how to reprint
materials from the Library.</p>

<a name="anchor3343714"></a>
<h3>To Share Your Resources in the
Library</h3>

  class="textlink">Community Rules</a> to see the requirements
  for adding links to the Library.</li>
  <li>Read <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/copyright.htm"

  resources in the Library can be used.</li>
  <li>Read <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/how-to-add.htm"
  class="textlink">How to Add</a> so you can consider sharing your
  favorite resources and learn how to share them, as well.</li>
</ul>

<a name="anchor3362902"></a>
<h2>To Get Acquainted With the Library</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Read the section <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/what-it-is.htm"
  class="textlink">What It Is</a> in the left sidebar.</li>
  <li>Scan the link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/" class="textlink">Broad
  Categories</a> in the right sidebar and get a feel for the types
  of topics in the Library. That is a partial list of the categories
  and topics. There are about 700 in the Library.</li>
  <li>Notice that if you hover your cursor over the phrase <a 
  href="http://managementhelp.org/">Broad Categories</a> on
  the right sidebar, a bubble pops up with a listing of some of
  the broad categories. That is available from any page in the
  Library, so it's very convenient for wherever you're at in the
  Library.</li>
  <li>Scan down the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/topics.htm"
  class="textlink">Index</a> on the upper, right corner to get
  an impression of the many topics in the Library. Realize that
  each of those very many links are to sections, themselves each
  having many additional links.</li>
  <li>Glance at the types of information in the section &quot;General
  Resources&quot; referenced from the right sidebar and notice
  the various resources in that section.</li>
  <li>Notice, in each topic, near the bottom of the page is a link
  &quot;Related Library Topics&quot; that goes to a list of other
  Library topics that are related to that topic. For example, near
  the bottom of the page of the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/marketing/advertising/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Advertising</a> is a link <a href="http://managementhelp.org/relatedtopics/market-rlt.htm"
  class="textlink">Related Library Topics</a>. If you click on
  that link, it takes you to a list of other Library topics in
  regard to Advertising.</li>
</ol>

<a name="anchor3363171"></a>
<h2>To Find a Certain Topic</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use the &quot;Search&quot; box in the upper, right corner
  of each page.</li>
  <li>Scan the list of broad categories from the <a href="http://managementhelp.org">home</a>
  page or by hovering your cursor over the phrase &quot;Broad Categories&quot;
  in the upper, right corner of each page.</li>
  <li>Scan the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/topics.htm">Index</a>
  from the link in the upper, right corner of each page.</li>
</ul>

<a name="anchor3363563"></a>
<h2>To Use the Library for Personal,
Professional or Organizational Development</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One of the best ways to discern which topics would be most
  useful to you is to do a quick assessment, for example, of yourself,
  your team or your organization.</li>
  <li>In the upper right, corner of each page, is a link to <a
  href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/diagnostics.htm"
  class="textlink">Assessments</a>. There are sections about for-profits,
  nonprofits, your personal or professional development, employee
  performance assessments, and group assessments.</li>
  <li>Don't worry about picking the &quot;perfect&quot; assessment.
  Most of them will help you find at least the top one or two topics,
  and you can start from there. When working to develop yourself,
  your team or your organization, many times it's the trying that
  counts -- if you make the effort, you cannot fail.</li>
  <li>Also, consider the free eMBAs available from the right sidebar.
  The <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freebusinesstraining/program-description.htm"
  class="textlink">Free Micro-eMBA</a> has 10 free, learning modules
  that can guide you to plan, develop and evaluate a for-profit
  organization. The <a href="http://managementhelp.org/freenonprofittraining/program-description.htm"
  class="textlink">Free Nonprofit Micro-eMBA</a> has 12 modules
  to help you plan, develop and evaluate a nonprofit organization.</li>
</ul>
