<h1>Free Management Library(sm) <br />
Developed and Provided by <br />
Authenticity Consulting, LLC</h1>

<p>The Library remains one of the most popular business sites
on the Internet -- many of the Library's topics consistently rank
in the top ten results from Google searches.</p>

<p>Carter McNamara, of Authenticity Consulting, LLC, originated
the concept of the Library, and then designed and developed the
Library. The Library began in 1995 and has since continued to
be updated and maintained by Authenticity.</p>

<p>Authenticity owns the design and the process in which the Library
operates. Carter wrote many of the articles in the Library topics
and also the introductory comments in many of the topics, as well.
Those articles are marked as &quot;Written by Carter McNamara
...&quot;.</p>

<p>Authenticity does not own all of the articles in the Library
-- many articles are included as links to other websites containing
articles written by other authors.</p>

<p>Authenticity's personnel and associates have strong expertise
and skills in many aspects of personnel, professional and organizational
development, as evidenced in the design and operation of the Library.</p>

<p>Here is an interview with Carter McNamara that describes the
reasons for the Library and its early development.</p>
