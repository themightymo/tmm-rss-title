<h1>Copyright and Reprint Terms</h1>

<h2>Can I Reprint Items from the Library?</h2>

<h3>When Requesting Permission, You Must Specify <u>Each</u> Article
With Its <u>Title</u> and <u>Web address</u> -- Do Not Request
Permission for Entire Categories or Topics</h3>

<p>In a public Library, you must specify each book you want --
you cannot ask to borrow an entire category or shelf of books.
Similarly, in the Free Management Library, you must specify <u>each</u>
article that you want to reprint. You can do so by specifying
the title of the resource and its Web address.</p>

<h3>Before Requesting, Find Out Who the Author Is -- We Cannot
Grant Permission for Resources That We Did Not Write</h3>

<p>There are many authors who have an article or more referenced
from the Library. The Library cannot grant permission to reprint
an article that was written by someone other than Carter McNamara.
Those resources mention &quot;written by Carter McNamara&quot;
or &quot;copyright Carter McNamara&quot; near the top. For those
articles, contact carter@authenticityconsulting.com , and specify
the Title and Web Address of <u>each</u> article.</p>

<p>To find out who owns an on-line resource, follow the tips below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try find the author's contact information (name, e-mail address
  and/or postal address) in the article, Website, etc. Then contact
  the author.</li>
  <li>If you can't find the author and contact information that
  way, then try find a link that links to contact information,
  for example, try find links to &quot;contact us&quot; and follow
  those links.</li>
  <li>If you can't find contact information that way, then try
  backing up from the address of the article. For example, if the
  Web address of the item is &quot;http://www.website.com/topics/articles/crisis_management.htm&quot;<br />
  then try:<br />
  a) Connect to http://www.Website.com/topics/articles and see
  if there is contact information there.<br />
  b) If there is no contact information there, then try http://www.Website.com/topics/
  and see if there is contact information there.<br />
  c) If there is no contact information there, then try http://www.website.com/</li>
</ol>

<h2>Can I Link From My Web Site to the Library or Any of its Topics?
Yes!</h2>

<p>Absolutely. The Library is a community resource. If linking
to it from your Web site will make it handier for you and others
to use materials from the Library, then go for it!</p>

<p>Similarly, if you want to include description of the Library
and its Web address in a publication or on your Web site, that's
fine, too.</p>

<p>However, if you would like to reprint materials from the Library
to include in another publication, on your Web site, etc., then
read the above guidelines about reprinting. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Free Management Library may NOT be Mirrored at Other Web Sites</h2>

<p>The Library design and/or its pages may not be copied and maintained
as a service at another Web site. While this mirroring (which
produces significant, duplicate copies of the Library and its
contents) may be convenient means to help others benefit from
the Library, the mirroring too often causes loss of central control
over administration and versions of the contents of the Library.
This central control is needed to ensure that the Library design
and all copies of materials are up-to-date, and that up-to-date
reprint terms are applied to the Library and its contents. Mirroring
also might be a copyright violation, depending on what you copy
from the Library.</p>
