<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>Below, are the most frequently asked questions from users of
the Library since 1995. Many answers are provided in the form
of links to other sections of the Library so that you can get
used to using those most useful sections and to avoid duplicating
their information herein.</p>

<h2>What is the purpose and scope of the Library? How is it unique?

<h2>How can I add materials to the Library?</h2>

<h2>Can I get Library materials provided to me on a CD-ROM or
as printed-out documents?</h2>

<p>The materials in the Library are owned by the authors and/or
publishers of those materials -- the Library does not own most
of the materials referenced from the Library. Thus, the Library
does not have the right to copy, publish and/or distribute those
materials. The Library provides those materials primarily by providing
links to them. For more information, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/copyright.htm"
target="_blank">Copyright, Reprint</a>.</p>

<h2>Where can I find additional sources of assistance to solve
management problems or achieve goals?</h2>

<p>There is a vast range of free resources available to you in
the &quot;General Resources&quot; section on the right-hand sidebar.
Also, see the &quot;Related Library Topics&quot; and &quot;Recommended
Books&quot; referenced from the bottom of each topic's page.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't the Library annotate each of the links in the
Library?</h2>

<p>An annotation is a very short (2- or 3-line) description of
the highlights of a particular resource, for example, of an article.
Different users often need different results from, and can have
different perspectives on, the same resource. Brief annotations
are often very generic and, thus, very often can't be specific
and useful enough to those having diverse needs from the same
resource.</p>

<p>Also, we've found since 1995 that users very rarely ask for
annotations -- instead, they find it more useful to quickly click
on the link to the article and then quickly scan it for themselves
according to their own needs and perspectives.</p>

<p>Besides, the links we provide to articles are almost always
on other websites -- those websites often annotate the articles.</p>

<p>Thus, we do not annotate each article in the Library.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't the Library offer online discussion groups for
each of its many topics?</h2>

<p>Online discussion groups and blogs are popping up like popcorn.
The vast majority of them do not achieve the high rate of participation
and feedback needed to make them useful to participants. The vast
majority fizzle out and die altogether.</p>

<p>However, there are several online groups in regard to management
that have already achieved that very high level of participation.
They have 1,000s of participants and are relevant to the vast
majority of topics in regard to management.</p>

<p>Our interests are ensuring that our users get prompt and useful
feedback -- they're much more likely to get that kind of feedback
from an already established online group, rather than our trying
to start a bunch of new groups.</p>

<p>Thus, we link to the current, highly participative groups --
see the link to &quot;Online Groups&quot; in the right-hand sidebar.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't the Library include users' ratings of each article
in the Library?</h2>

<p>Our users report to us that ratings of articles are not really
useful to them. They rarely look for ratings. It's just as easy
for them to quickly scan an article to see if it meets their own
unique needs at that particular time.</p>

<h2>Why doesn't the Library include the text of each article on
the Library's Website, rather than linking to articles?</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the vast majority of writers of articles already
have Web sites. We don't see the need to duplicate their articles
on the Library's website. We have no interest in owning or managing
other's articles. We don't need to.</p>

<h2>Why isn't the Library integrated in an online dynamic system,
such as Active Server Pages or a database-driven system?</h2>

<p>From its inception in 1995, 1,000s of organizations began linking
to many of the 100s of topics in the Library. Many schools include
specific links in their course materials to specific topics in
the Library. Many hardcopy, published articles have included links
in their articles, as well.</p>

<p>Moving to a different system would result in changing (breaking)
those many links and Web addresses and/or in administrating a
cumbersome mapping system between the old links and the new links.</p>

<p>We've found that we can retain the very useful organization
of resources (including categories, topics, subtopics, etc.) and
the same link addresses without having the break the links or
requiring our users to use links that are 100s of characters long.
