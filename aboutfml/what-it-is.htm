<h2>Purpose of the
Library</h2>

<p>The Library provides free, easy-to-access, online articles
to develop yourself, other individuals, groups and organizations
(whether the organization is for-profit or nonprofit). Over the
past 15 years, the Library has grown to be one of the world's
largest well-organized collections of these types of articles
and resources.</p>

<p>The Library has been averaging 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 visitors
(not hits) per month.. Many of its topics consistently rank in
the top ten results from Google searches.</p>

<p>To read more about the history of the Library, see the following
article (it takes a bit of time to load, so be patient.)<br />

<h2>Focus and Scope of Information
in the Library</h2>

<h3>Vast Amount of Information in the Library, But Library is
Not a &quot;Content Farm&quot;</h3>

<p>There are approximately 650 topics in the Library, spanning
almost 10,000 links. Each topic has additionally recommended books
and related Library topics. The Library is not an ezine site or
&quot;content farm&quot;. We do not try to accumulate as many
articles as possible in order to maximize the number of visitors
we get in order to maximize ad revenue. We do not buy articles.
We decline about 50% of the articles submitted to the site. The
Library is an informational and educational site.</p>

<h3>Focus and Type of Content in the Library</h3>

<p>The Library focuses especially on free, online and practical
information that visitors can quickly apply. Articles are about
personal, professional and organizational development. Therefore,
the Library does not focus on topics, such as lifestyle, entertainment,
politics, philosophy and religion. Also, the Library does not
list specific companies, industry information, maps, investment
information and listings of schools. You can get a quick sense
for the nature of the Library's topics by viewing the <a href="http://managementhelp.org"
class="textlink">Board Categories</a> to the right on each page.</p>

<h3>Library Topics Pertain to For-Profits and Nonprofits</h3>

<p>For people who want to use the Library to develop their organizations,
the Library applies to for-profit and nonprofit organizations.
Many resources for nonprofits tend to be nonprofit-specific, that
is, they are primarily about fundraising, volunteers, public policy
and advocating. Actually, most of the activities conducted in
nonprofits are the same as those in for-profits. The differences
between organizations have more to do with their size than the
nature of their services -- small for-profits are more like small
nonprofits than large for-profits. Similarly, large nonprofits
are more like large for-profits than small nonprofits. We make
the Library useful to both for-profits and nonprofits, recognizing
the vast similarities, as well as differences, between both types
of organizations. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/fp_np.htm"
class="textlink">Library Includes Materials for For-Profits and
Nonprofit Organizations</a>.</p>

<h3>Numerous Ways to Learn in the Library</h3>

<p>Visitors can learn a great deal in the Library. There are almost
700 topics in the Library, each with highly practical articles.
Visitors can very quickly learn a lot about a topic just by scanning
the list of subtopics in that topic and how those subtopics are
arranged together. Visitors also can use various assessments to
closely examine themselves, their groups and their organizations.
Results of those assessments can be use to select the best topics
to focus on, in the Library. Visitors also can capture their learning
in learning plans that are as informal as learning journals or
as formal as systematic learning plans. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/how-to-use-it.htm"
class="textlink">How to Use the Library</a>.</p>

<h2>Users Contribute Resources to
the Library and Why</h2>

<p>The Library is itself a <b>free community resource</b> to be
shared and contributed to by users and authors across the world.
Links and other resources are contributed by others from around
the world. The resources remain the property of the authors of
that information. Benefits to contributors include that their
resources, and consequently the authors, get tremendous exposure
around the world. At the time of this writing, users from up to
80 countries are using the Library. (See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/how-to-use-it.htm#anchor3343714"

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<a name="anchor3478013"></a>
<h3>Who provides the library?</h3>

<p>
<a href="authenticity.htm">Authenticity Consulting, LLC</a>,
provides the Library as a <b>free community resource</b>. The
Library has its own logo and domain name, apart from Authenticity
Consulting, LLC. Carter McNamara, of Authenticity Consulting,
LLC, began putting resources on the Internet for others, back
in the very early 1990s when he had the privilege of working with
the &quot;Gopher&quot; tool at the University of Minnesota. (The
University's tool was one of the first user-friendly tools for
uploading, downloading and managing files on the Internet.)</p>

<a name="anchor3484291"></a>
<h3>What is the purpose and scope
of the Library? How is it unique? What's its &quot;niche&quot;?</h3>

<p>See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/what-it-is.htm#anchor3474796"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Purpose of the Library</a></p>

<a name="anchor3484033"></a>
<h3>How can I learn to use the Library
to best meet my needs?</h3>

<p>See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/how-to-use-it.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">How To Use the Library</a></p>

<a name="anchor5470"></a>
<h3>Are the Library materials curated
(evaluated) for inclusion in the Library?</h3>

<p>Yes. We review 10-20 articles a day for consideration of inclusion
to the Library. Each article is evaluated for accuracy. For example,
if an article asserts specific laws, regulations or other specific
assertions that clearly are inaccurate, then the article is not
included in the Library. Each article also is evaluated for substance.
For example, if an article is the short length of one computer
screen and includes only vague, obvious generalities, then the
article is not included in the Library. If readers notify us of
an article in the Library that is verified to be inaccurate (that
is other than merely a different opinion than the readers'), then
we remove the article from the Library.</p>

<a name="anchor3483786"></a>
<h3>What if I want to copy or distribute
materials from the library? Who owns the materials?</h3>

<p>See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/copyright.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Copyright and Reprint Terms</a></p>

<a name="anchor3483503"></a>
<h3>How can I add materials to the
Library?</h3>

<p>See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/how-to-use-it.htm#anchor3343714"
target="_blank" class="textlink">To Share Your Resources in the
Library</a></p>

<a name="anchor3483224"></a>
<h3>Can I get Library materials provided
to me on a CD-ROM or as printed-out documents?</h3>

<p>The materials in the Library are owned by the authors and/or
publishers of those materials -- the Library does not own most
of the materials referenced from the Library. Thus, the Library
does not have the right to copy, publish and/or distribute those
materials. The Library provides those materials primarily by providing
links to them. For more information, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/aboutfml/copyright.htm"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Copyright and Reprint Terms</a>.</p>

<a name="anchor3482633"></a>
<h3>Where can I find additional sources
of assistance to solve management problems or achieve goals?</h3>

<p>There is a vast range of free resources available to you in
the &quot;General Resources&quot; section on the right-hand sidebar.
Also, see the &quot;Related Library Topics&quot; and &quot;Recommended
Books&quot; referenced from the bottom of each topic's page.</p>

<a name="anchor3482403"></a>
<h3>Why doesn't the Library annotate
each of the links in the Library?</h3>

<p>An annotation is a very short (usually 2- or 3-line) description
of the highlights of a particular resource, for example, of an
article. Different users often need different results from, and
can have different perspectives on, the same resource. Brief annotations
are often very generic and, thus, very often can't be specific
and useful enough to those having diverse needs from the same
resource.</p>

<p>Also, we've found since 1995 that users very rarely ask for
annotations -- instead, they find it more useful to quickly click
on the link to the article and then quickly scan it for themselves
according to their own needs and perspectives.</p>

<p>Besides, the links we provide to articles are almost always
on other websites -- those websites often annotate the articles.</p>

<a name="anchor3482039"></a>
<h3>Why doesn't the Library offer
online discussion groups for each of its many topics?</h3>

<p>Online discussion groups and blogs are popping up like popcorn.
The vast majority of them do not achieve the high rate of participation
and feedback needed to make them useful to participants. The vast
majority fizzle out and die altogether.</p>

<p>However, there are already numerous groups about personal,
professional and organizational development that have already
achieved that very high level of participation. They have 1,000s
of participants and are relevant to the vast majority of topics
in regard to management. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/generalresources/free-online-groups.htm">Online
Discussion Groups</a>.</p>

<p>Our interests are ensuring that our users get prompt and useful
feedback -- they're much more likely to get that kind of feedback
from an already established online group, rather than our trying
to start a bunch of new groups.</p>

<a name="anchor3480390"></a>
<h3>Why doesn't the Library include
users' ratings of each article in the Library?</h3>

<p>Our users report to us that ratings of articles are not really
useful to them. They rarely look for ratings. It's just as easy
for them to quickly scan an article to see if it meets their own
unique needs at that particular time. Besides, each person still
should decide for themselves if an article is useful to him or
her.</p>

<a name="anchor3565805"></a>
<h3>Why doesn't the Library require
visitors to register before using the Library?</h3>

<p>We have no need or interest in obtaining your name or email
address. Many of the authors, whose resources we link to, intended
for their resources to be free to the world -- they did not intend
for others to have to give their name, email address, etc., to
use those resources, so the Library shouldn't either. (The terms
for contributing links to the Library include that the users of
the Library do not have to register to use those resources. See
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/email/form-to-add-content.htm">To
Add a Link to the Library</a>.)</p>

<a name="anchor3480640"></a>
<h3>Why doesn't the Library include
the text of each article on the Library's Website, rather than
linking to articles?</h3>

<p>Nowadays, the vast majority of writers of articles already
have Web sites. We don't see the need to duplicate their articles
on the Library's website. We have no interest in owning or managing
other's articles. We don't need to.</p>

<a name="anchor3480925"></a>
<h3>Why isn't the Library integrated
in an online dynamic system, such as Active Server Pages or a
database-driven system?</h3>

<p>From its inception in 1995, 1,000s of organizations began linking
to many of the 100s of topics in the Library. Many schools include
specific links in their course materials to specific topics in
the Library. Many hardcopy, published articles have included links
in their articles, as well.</p>

<p>Moving to a different system would result in changing (breaking)
those many links and Web addresses and/or in administrating a
cumbersome mapping system between the old links and the new links.</p>

<p>We've found that we can retain the very useful organization
of resources (including categories, topics, subtopics, etc.) and
the same link addresses without having the break the links or
requiring our users to use links that are 100s of characters long.
