<h2>Goal of Integrating For-Profit and Nonprofit Information in the Library</h2>

To date, there has been a great deal of online management
information that, at first glance, appears exclusive to the needs
of for-profits. Online management information for nonprofits
tends to be focused on activities unique to nonprofits, but not
to the many areas of management that are common to both for-profits
and nonprofits. Consequently, nonprofit organizations tend to
miss out on a great deal of useful online information about management.
Hopefully, one of the outcomes from the library will be an increased
range of management information available to nonprofit organizations.
Another outcome might be increased understanding about both types
of organizations, including their strong similarities.</p>

<h2>For-Profit and Nonprofit Organizations Have Great Deal in Common</h2>

Many people have a misconception that nonprofit organizations
are very different from for-profit organizations. While the two
types of organizations are different in certain aspects (see
<a class="textlink" href="#anchor766418">General Features Often Unique to Nonprofits</a>),
the vast majority of management activities are common to both
types of organizations.</p>

<p>Often, in management practices, the most important difference
to focus on is the size of the organization, rather than whether
it's a for-profit or nonprofit. Small nonprofits are often much
more similar to small for-profits than to large nonprofits. Similarly,
large nonprofits are often more similar to large for-profits than
small nonprofits.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor766065"></a>
<h2>Different Names for Similar Concepts</h2>

Each of these two types of organizations tends to have
its own wording for the same (or similar) concepts. The following
table depicts this different wording.</p>

<p><table width="450" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
<p align="center"><h4>For-Profit Term</h4></p></td>
    <td width="50%">
<p align="center"><h4>Nonprofit Term</h4></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
    employees</td> 
    <td width="50%">
    staff</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>
    customers</td> 
    <td>
    clients</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
    investors</td> 
    <td width="50%">
    funders</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
    products</td> 
    <td width="50%">
    services</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
    results</td> 
    <td width="50%">
    outcomes (see note 2 below)</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>
    chief executive officer</td> 
    <td>
    executive director</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>
    sales</td> 
    <td>
    revenue</td>
  </tr> 
</table></p>

<p>NOTE 1: For-profits often use the term &quot;results&quot;
to mean a desired level of profit or certain solutions for customers
(internal or external). Nonprofits use the term &quot;outcomes&quot;
to mean impacts on clients, that is, enhanced learning, self-reliance,
etc.</p>

<h2>Features Generally Unique to Nonprofits</h2>

Nonprofit organizations differ from for-profit <i>generally</i>
in the following areas:</p>

<p>1. <b>Nonprofits focus more on fundraising from donors,
e.g., grants, contributions, etc.</b> For-profit organizations,
on the other hand, focus more on &quot;fundraising&quot; from
investors.</p>

<p>2. <b>Nonprofits tend to focus more on board of directors' activities</b><br />
For-profit corporations also have boards of directors. However,
their board members are usually more highly trained and experienced
in business, leadership and management than in nonprofits, 
where board members are often volunteers who bring strong passion 
for the nonprofit mission. However, with the fairly recent 
Enron debacle, both for-profits and nonprofits are having to focus more 
on developing their boards.  </p>

<p>3. <b>Nonprofits focus more on volunteer management</b><br />
However, volunteers are (or should be) managed much like employees,
e.g., with job descriptions, policies, etc.</p>

<p>4. <b>Nonprofit finances are a little different than for-profit</b><br />
Nonprofits focus on &quot;human capital&quot; whereas for-profits
focus on monetary capital. Nonprofits have certain unique accounts,
e.g., restricted accounts, or accounts designating funds (usually
grants) that can only be spent on certain activities. However,
both types of organizations carry out very similar basic bookkeeping
activities, generating financial statements (they each use different
names for the statements, which are also quite similar), analyzing
financial statements and reporting financial information.  With the recent 
focus on for-profits being more accountable to the community and society, 
for-profits are focusing more on social impacts than ever before.  </p>

<p>5. <b>Nonprofit taxes are different than for-profit</b><br />
Many nonprofits can be tax-exempt (that is, exempt from paying federal
and certain other kinds of taxes) and tax-deductible (that is,
donations to the nonprofits can be deducted from the donor's gross
income). Accordingly, they are expected to file certain kinds
of tax forms. Certain types of nonprofits also must minimize certain
kinds of activities, such as lobbying or earning over certain
amounts of revenue that are not associated with the nonprofit
mission.</p>
