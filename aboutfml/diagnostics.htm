<h1>Assessments:<br />Select Library Topics from &quot;Diagnosing&quot; Yourself, <br />Group or Organization?</h1>

<p>You can use the information in this section of Library to get
a quick impression, or assessment, of the quality of the activities
within your organization (whether for-profit or nonprofit) or
of other management activities, such as managing yourself or groups.
Assessments often can be conducted by your filling out a very
convenient, comprehensive online questionnaire.</p>

<p>Assessments can help you to identify &quot;what you did not
know that you did not know&quot; or &quot;what you thought was
so, but isn't so.&quot; Assessments aren't &quot;fixes&quot; or
&quot;solutions.&quot; They represent yet another perspective
for you to understand organizations, processes and yourself.</p>

<p>You can use the information from your assessment to identify
what Library topics might be most useful to you. For example,
if the results of your organizational assessment indicate that
your organization needs a lot of work in its Board of Directors,
then the Library topic of &quot;Boards of Directors&quot; will
be very useful to you. Similarly, your organization might need
work in strategic planning, business planning, product and programs,
staffing, marketing, finances, etc.</p>

<p>Some people dislike the term diagnosis, believing that systems,
such as organizations and human beings, cannot be diagnosed as
if these systems are somehow static and can be understand merely
by answering questions about them. Therefore, the term discovery
might be more apt for these systems.</p>

<p>The following information uses the terms assessment and evaluation
interchangeably -- an approach that is increasingly common. (Technically,
an assessment is a measurement and an evaluation associates a
judgment and sometimes recommendations to that assessment.)</p>

<h2>Selecting Assessment Tools</h2>

<p>Many of the questionnaires were placed on the Web by their
authors for others to use. An assessment often reflects the philosophy
and values of the author of that assessment. For example, some
authors favor focus primarily on peoples' values and beliefs,
others on business policies and operations, others on both. You
should consider this when you select a particular assessment.</p>

<p>Many assessments are in the form of quick questionnaires. Others
are more comprehensive, sometimes validated (scientifically developed
for accuracy, validity and reliability) tools that can include
questionnaires, interviews, observation, etc.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines to selecting from among publicly available
assessments. The following sections suggest a variety of assessments,
as well.<br />

scan the various tools. Seek to find assessments that are understandable

<h2>A Diagnostic Model to Analyze Results
of Your Organizational Assessment</h2>

<p>You might choose to address each of the areas that your assessment
suggests need attention. You might not be concerned in which order
you address those areas -- you'll address all of them. Also, you
might not choose to analyze for the root causes of the various
issues -- and instead just do the best you can to address as many
issues as possible by going forward. In that case, a diagnostic
model isn't necessary.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to do further analysis of the results
of your assessment, including to understand more about root causes
of the issues in the organization and in which order to address
the different issues in your organization, then a diagnostic model
will be handy. Here's one model to consider for either for-profits
or nonprofits.<br />

<h2>Assessing Performance of Groups
(Teams) in Your Organization</h2>

<p>Similar to assessing employees, this type of assessment should
be done very carefully and in accordance with up-to-date personnel
policies that conform to the employment laws of your state/province
and/or country. If your group is rather large, for example, over
12 members, then the dynamics of the group can be very similar
to that of an overall organization, in which case organizational
assessment tools might be suitable (see above). The following
link is to a comprehensive description of group performance management.</p>
