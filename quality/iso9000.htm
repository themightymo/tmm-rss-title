<h1>ISO9000 Quality Standard</h1>

<!--[index|Quality Management]-->

<p>ISO 9000 is an internationally recognized standard of quality and includes 
  guidelines to accomplish the ISO 9000 standard. Organizations can be audited 
  to earn ISO 9000 certification. The ISO 9000 has been enhanced by numerous other 
  ISO-related standards. There have been several additions to the ISO 9000 family 
  of models, producing various new names with numbers in the 9000 series, for 
  example, ISO 9001 and ISO 9002. </p>
<p>Before reading more about the ISO9000 standards, it might be
helpful to quickly review the major forms of quality management
in an organization. These are briefly described at the top of
the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/index.htm">Quality
Management</a> topic.</p>
