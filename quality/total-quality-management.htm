<!--[index|Quality Management]-->
<p>TQM is a set of management practices throughout the organization, geared to 
  ensure the organization consistently meets or exceeds customer requirements. 
  TQM places strong focus on process measurement and controls as means of continuous 
  improvement.</p>
<p>Before reading more about TQM, it might be helpful to quickly review the major 
  forms of quality management in an organization. These are briefly described 
  at the top of the <a href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/index.htm"
class="textlink">Quality Management</a> topic.</p>
<h2><a name="seven" id="seven"></a>7 Important Principles of Total Quality Management</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="mailto:quinharris509@gmail.com">Quin

<p>Total Quality Management (TQM) is an approach that organizations use to improve 
  their internal processes and increase customer satisfaction. When it is properly 
  implemented, this style of management can lead to decreased costs related to 
  corrective or preventative maintenance, better overall performance, and an increased 
  number of happy and loyal customers.</p>
<p>However, TQM is not something that happens overnight. While there are a number 
  of software solutions that will help organizations quickly start to implement 
  a quality management system, there are some underlying philosophies that the 
  company must integrate throughout every department of the company and at every 
  level of management. Whatever other resources you use, you should adopt these 
  seven important principles of Total Quality Management as a foundation for all 
  your activities.</p>
<h3>1. Quality can and must be managed</h3>
<p>Many companies have wallowed in a repetitive cycle of chaos and customer complaints. 
  They believe that their operations are simply too large to effectively manage 
  the level of quality. The first step in the TQM process, then, is to realize 
  there is a problem and that it can be controlled.</p>
<h3>2. Processes, not people, are the problem</h3>
<p>If your process is causing problems, it won&#8217;t matter how many times you 
  hire new employees or how many training sessions you put them through. Correct 
  the process and then train your people on these new procedures.</p>
<h3>3. Don&#8217;t treat symptoms, look for the cure</h3>
<p>If you just patch over the underlying problems in the process, you will never 
  be able to fully reach your potential. If, for example, your shipping department 
  is falling behind, you may find that it is because of holdups in manufacturing. 
  Go for the source to correct the problem.</p>
<h3>4. Every employee is responsible for quality</h3>
<p>Everyone in the company, from the workers on the line to the upper management, 
  must realize that they have an important part to play in ensuring high levels 
  of quality in their products and services. Everyone has a customer to delight, 
  and they must all step up and take responsibility for them.</p>
<h3>5. Quality must be measurable</h3>
<p>A quality management system is only effective when you can quantify the results. 
  You need to see how the process is implemented and if it is having the desired 
  effect. This will help you set your goals for the future and ensure that every 
  department is working toward the same result.</p>
<h3>6. Quality improvements must be continuous</h3>
<p>Total Quality Management is not something that can be done once and then forgotten. 
  It&#8217;s not a management &#8220;phase&#8221; that will end after a problem 
  has been corrected. Real improvements must occur frequently and continually 
  in order to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
<h3>7. Quality is a long-term investment</h3>
<p>Quality management is not a quick fix. You can purchase QMS software that will 
  help you get things started, but you should understand that real results won&#8217;t 
  occur immediately. TQM is a long-term investment, and it is designed to help 
  you find long-term success.</p>
<p>Before you start looking for any kind of quality management software, it is 
  important to make sure you are capable of implementing these fundamental principles 
  throughout the company. This kind of management style can be a huge culture 
  change in some companies, and sometimes the shift can come with some growing 
  pains, but if you build on a foundation of quality principles, you will be equipped 
  to make this change and start working toward real long-term success.</p>
