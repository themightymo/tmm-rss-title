<h1>Continuous Improvement</h1>

<!--[index|Quality Management]-->

<p>This method focuses on improving customer satisfaction &#8211; a primary outcome 
  from achieving the most appropriate organizational results &#8211; through continuous 
  and incremental improvements to internal processes, and/or by removing unnecessary 
  activities and variations. It is highly likely that many organizations already 
  pursue some course of continuous improvement without recognizing the method 
  as such. Proponents of continuous improvement point out that the benefit of 
  the method is that it forms a comprehensive, detailed approach to process improvement 
  &#8211; not a reactive, hit-or-miss approach. Continuous improvement is often 
  perceived as a quality management initiative.</p>
<p>Before reading more about continuous improvement, it might
be helpful to quickly review the major forms of quality management
in an organization. These are briefly described at the top of
the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/index.htm">Quality
Management</a> topic.</p>
