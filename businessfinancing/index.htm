<h1>Financing for For-Profits</h1>

<!--[index|Financial Management (For-Profit)]-->
<p>Applies to
for-profits unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>For-profit entrepreneurs and managers often seek financing
to start a new business, restructure operations or start a new
product. Note that an entrepreneur will very likely need a <a

class="textlink">business plan</a> in order to secure financing.
Developing a business plan holds many more advantages than just
applying for funding.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.thrivebusinesscoachingandconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Tove 
  Rasmussen</a></p>
<p>I just spoke with a bank manager yesterday about how his clients do not have 
  well thought out plans for starting a business or expanding a business. So, 
  I thought I&#8217;d help you out here.</p>
<h3>Standard Questions a Bank Will Ask - a Business Plan</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Do you have experience in the industry?</li>
  <li> Does your plan make sense?</li>
  <li> Is there a market need?</li>
  <li> Can you make money?</li>
  <li> Does your pricing make sense?</li>
  <li> What are the risks?</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to have your bases covered on these questions before talking with 
  the bank.</p>
<p>Then, the bank will ask for a <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessplanning/index.htm">business 
  plan</a>. </p>
<p>For a new business, the bar is high. You are trying to prove a need without 
  the sales to show you have a salable product or service.</p>
<p>For an expansion, you must have already demonstrated the value of your product. 
  However, the bank will still require a well thought out plan that it believes 
  you can and will implement.</p>
<h3>Prepare for the Business Plan with Research</h3>
<p>To prepare for the business plan research the government requirements, effect 
  of the economic cycle (especially being in a downturn now), social and technological 
  trends. Understand these issues thoroughly and how they will affect your business.</p>
<p>Then look at your possible competitors. This includes substitutes for your 
  product, the ease of entering the market, the bargaining power of suppliers 
  and of buyers. Take a look on the web and talk to industry participants.</p>
<h3>Summarize the Business Plan with Opportunities and Threats, Strengths and 
  Weaknesses </h3>
<p>Spend some time understanding your market needs and buying behavior (Refer 
  to What DOES Your Target Market Want? below). The results will provide you with 
  the information you need to determine your competitive advantage and/or the 
  reason your expansion will be successful. </p>
<p>Follow the research up by understanding the value of your product or service 
  to your customers in dollars and cents, particularly versus your competition. 
  Ensure you have your product or service, pricing, promotion and delivery of 
  your service figured out.</p>
<p>Then thoroughly consider your company&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Try 
  to get an outside view from customers. A simple but carefully considered survey 
  can help here. The wording will be crucial to obtaining useful information. 
  Take a look at the Net Promoter(R) Score literature to see if this is the approach 
  you want to use (netpromoter.com).</p>
<p>Armed with this information, you will be ready to prepare your business plan. 
  I will cover this in the next blog. Feel free to let me know any specific issues 
  you have so I can be sure to address them.</p>
<h3>Putting Your Business Plan Together</h3>
<p>The bank wants a business plan. You have collected all the information on the 
  external environment, company strengths and weaknesses. You thoroughly understand 
  the market and financial rationale for starting or expanding your business.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to put the plan together. Typically the business plan will 
  start with a one page executive summary. It will include the compelling reasons 
  for the expansion, including the customers you have in place. For a start up, 
  the executive summary will highlight the advantage of your business over the 
  existing competitors out there.</p>
<p>Then you move into the details. A business plan typically starts with the marketing 
  plan, the reason for the business&#8217;s existence. It will include your target 
  market and how attractive it is to be in that market. Include market growth, 
  trends, size, etc. Demonstrate a clear understanding of market needs, backed 
  by objective data where possible.</p>
<p>Detailing your competitive advantage is key. Here it is critical to provide 
  information on your competitors in order for readers to objectively evaluate 
  the power of your business&#8217;s advantage. </p>
<p>Translate the competitive advantage into a value proposition. How valuable 
  is your advantage to your customers? This information will feed into your business 
  model ie, how you plan to make money.</p>
<p>Wind this all up with your promotional plan: how you plan to position your 
  product or service in the market; product features; the pricing level, especially 
  versus the competition; the promotional plan for getting your message to the 
  market, including direct sales; and how you plan to deliver your product to 
  the market.</p>
<p>Operations is the next key piece of the business plan. This is the opportunity 
  to explain in detail how the product will be manufactured or the service delivered. 
  It is important to outline the rationale for the key expenses and investments 
  needed, as this will provide the information to support the numbers in the upcoming 
  financial plan. </p>
<p>Ensure the competitive advantage is delivered by the operations, if that is 
  your source of advantage. The more proof there is to demonstrate the advantage 
  will be delivered to the market, the more credible the plan is to the bank &#8212; 
  and verified for your own peace of mind.</p>
<p>The next sections of the business plan will include the other key functions 
  of your business. This will vary according to the business. Possibilities include 
  Regulatory, Research and Development, and Information Technology. Again, explain 
  the expenses, investments and how these departments deliver on your competitive 
  advantage.</p>
<p>Finally, crucial to your business plan are the financials. These will include 
  your pro forma (projected) income statements with your revenues and expenses. 
  It will also include your pro forma balance sheet, with the impact of the profit 
  or loss on your assets, debt and equity. The assumptions need to be clear. It 
  is a good idea to have an accountant review these numbers, if not help you put 
  them together.</p>
<p>For the variables that present the most risk, it is a good idea to include 
  a best case, worst case and most likely case. This will show the impact of shifts 
  on the financials, which clarifies the variables to most closely monitor. An 
  accountant can also assist with the sensitivities.</p>
<p>Following the above steps will yield a solid business plan for the bank, and 
  for your own management of the company. Here&#8217;s wishing you the best of 
  luck with your new business, or expansion.</p>
