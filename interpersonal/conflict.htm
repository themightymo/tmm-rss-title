<h2><a name="confusion" id="confusion"></a>Clarifying Confusion About Conflict</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Conflict occurs with two or more people who, despite their first attempts at 
  agreement, do not yet have agreement on a course of action, usually because 
  their values, perspectives and opinions are contradictory in nature. Conflict 
  can occur: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Within yourself when you are not living according to your values.</li>
  <li> When your values and perspectives are threatened.</li>
  <li> When there is discomfort from fear of the unknown or from lack of fulfillment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conflict is inevitable and often necessary when forming high-performing teams 
  because they evolve through &#8220;form, storm, norm and perform&#8221; periods. 
  Getting the most out of diversity often means addressing contradictory values, 
  perspectives and opinions. Conflict is often needed. It: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Helps to raise and address problems.</li>
  <li> Energizes work to be focused on the most important priorities.</li>
  <li> Helps people &#8220;be real&#8221; and motivates them to fully participate. 
  </li>
  <li>Helps people learn how to recognize and benefit from their differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflict is not the same as discomfort. The conflict is not the problem &#8211; 
  poor management of the conflict is the problem. Conflict is a problem when it: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hampers productivity.</li>
  <li> Lowers morale.</li>
  <li> Causes more and continued conflicts.</li>
  <li> Causes inappropriate behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="actions" id="actions"></a>Types of Managerial Actions That Cause 
  Workplace Conflicts</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<h3>1. Poor communications</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Employees experience continual surprises, for example, they are not informed 
    of major decisions that affect their workplaces and lives. </li>
  <li>Employees do not understand the reasons for the decisions &#8211; they are 
    not involved in the decision-making.</li>
  <li> As a result, they trust the &#8220;rumor mill&#8221; more than their management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The alignment or the amount of resources is insufficient. There is:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Disagreement about &#8220;who does what.&#8221;</li>
  <li> Stress from working with inadequate resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.&#8220;Personal chemistry,&#8221; including conflicting values or actions, 
  for example: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strong interpersonal natures among workers do not seem to match.</li>
  <li> We do not like others because they seem too much like ourselves (we often 
    do not like in others what we do not like in ourselves). </li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Leadership problems</h3>
<p>For example, inconsistent, missing, too-strong or uninformed leadership (at 
  any level in the organization), evidenced by: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoiding conflict, &#8220;passing the buck&#8221; with little follow-through 
    on decisions.</li>
  <li> Employees see the same continued issues in the workplace. </li>
  <li>Supervisors do not understand the jobs of their subordinates. </li>
</ul>

  Conflicts</h2>

<h3>1. Regularly review job descriptions. Get your employee&#8217;s input to them. 
  Ensure: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Job roles do not conflict.</li>
  <li> No tasks &#8220;fall in a crack.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Intentionally build relationships with all subordinates.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Meet at least once a month alone with them in office.</li>
  <li>Ask about accomplishments, challenges and issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Get regular, written status reports that describe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Accomplishments.</li>
  <li> Currents issues and needs from management.</li>
  <li> Plans for the upcoming period.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Conduct basic training about: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Interpersonal communications.</li>
  <li> Conflict management.</li>
  <li> Delegation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Develop procedures for routine tasks and include the employees&#8217; input.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have employees write procedures when possible and appropriate. </li>
  <li>Get employees&#8217; review of the procedures.</li>
  <li> Distribute the procedures.</li>
  <li> Train employees about the procedures. </li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Regularly hold management meetings with all employees. </h3>
<p>For example, every month, communicate new initiatives and status of current 
  products or services.</p>
<h3>7. Consider an anonymous suggestion box in which employees can provide suggestions. 
</h3>
<p>This can be powerful means to collect honest feedback, especially in very conflicted 
  workplaces. </p>
<h2><a name="deal" id="deal"></a>Ways People Deal With Conflict</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>There is no one best way to deal with conflict. It depends on the current situation. 
  Here are the major ways that people use to deal with conflict: </p>
<h3>1. You can avoid it. </h3>
<p>Pretend it is not there or ignore it. Use this approach only when it simply 
  is not worth the effort to argue. Be aware that this approach tends to worsen 
  the conflict over time. </p>
<h3>2. You can accommodate it. </h3>
<p>You can give in to others, sometimes to the extent that you compromise yourself. 
  Use this approach very sparingly and infrequently, for example, in situations 
  when you know that you will have another more useful approach in the very near 
  future. Usually this approach tends to worsen the conflict over time, and causes 
  conflicts within yourself. </p>
<h3>3. You can compete with the others. </h3>
<p>You can work to get your way, rather than clarifying and addressing the issue. 
  Competitors love accommodators. Use this approach when you have a very strong 
  conviction about your position.</p>
<h3>4. Compromising. </h3>
<p>You can engage in mutual give-and-take. This approach is used when the goal 
  is to get past the issue and move on together. </p>
<h3>5. Collaborating. </h3>
<p>You can focus on working together. Use this approach when the goal is to meet 
  as many current needs as possible by using mutual resources. This approach sometimes 
  raises new mutual needs. Collaboration can also be used when the goal is to 
  cultivate ownership and commitment.</p>
<h2><a name="another" id="another"></a>To Manage a Conflict with Another Person</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<h3>1. Know what you do not like about yourself, early on in your career. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>We often do not like in others what we do not want to see in ourselves. 
  </li>
  <li>Write down 5 traits that really bug you when see them in others.</li>
  <li> Be aware that these traits are your &#8220;hot buttons.&#8221; </li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Manage yourself. If you and/or another person are getting upset, then manage 
  yourself to stay calm: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Speak to the person as if the other person is not upset &#8211; this can 
    be very effective!</li>
  <li> Avoid use of the word &#8220;you&#8221; &#8211; this avoids your appearing 
    to be blaming the person.</li>
  <li> Nod your head to assure the person that you heard him/her.</li>
  <li> Maintain eye contact with the person. </li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Move the discussion to a private area, if possible.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many times, moving to a new environment invites both of you to see or feel 
    differently. </li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Give the other person time to vent.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not interrupt the person or judge what he/she is saying. </li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Verify that you are accurately hearing each other. When the other person 
  is done speaking: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ask the person to let you rephrase (uninterrupted) what you are hearing 
    to ensure you are hearing it correctly.</li>
  <li> To understand the person more, ask open-ended questions (avoid &#8220;why&#8221; 
    questions &#8211; those questions often make people feel defensive).</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Repeat the above step, for the other to verify that he/she is hearing you. 
  Describe your perspective: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use &#8220;I&#8221;, not &#8220;you.&#8221;</li>
  <li> Talk in terms of the present as much as possible.</li>
  <li> Quickly mention your feelings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Acknowledge where you disagree and where you agree. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the most powerful means to resolve conflict is to mention where you 
    both agree.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Discuss the matter on which you disagree, not the nature of the other person. 
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ask &#8220;What can we do fix the problem?&#8221; The person might begin 
    to complain again.</li>
  <li> Then ask the same question. Focus on actions you both can do. </li>
  <li>Ask the other person if they will support the action(s).</li>
  <li> If the person will not, then ask for a &#8220;cooling off period&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Thank the person for working with you. </h3>
<ul>
  <li>It takes patience for a person to engage in meaningful conversation during 
    conflict. Acknowledge and thank the other person for his/her effort. </li>
</ul>
<h3>10. If the situation remains a conflict, then: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conclude if the other person&#8217;s behavior violates one of the personnel 
    policies and procedures in the workplace and if it does, then follow the policy&#8217;s 
    terms for addressing that violation.</li>
  <li> Otherwise, consider whether to agree to disagree.</li>
  <li> Consider seeking a third party to mediate.</li>
</ul>
