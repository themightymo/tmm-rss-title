<p>In today&#8217;s business world, it is imperative to be able to disagree with 
  tact and professionalism. My coaching clients find themselves in situations 
  where they disagree with others, yet need to rely on these same people to get 
  work done. The way you tell someone that you disagree really matters. Agreeably 
  Disagree is a helpful technique that lets you disagree with someone without 
  damaging the relationship.</p>
<p>Here are 4 Steps to Agreeably Disagree:</p>
<h3>1. Listen </h3>
<p>Avoid cutting people off. Never tell them they are wrong &#8211; hear them 
  out.</p>
<h3>2. Acknowledge the other person&#8217;s idea/opinion/point of view by saying 
  something like:</h3>
<p>&#8220;I hear what you are saying&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have some points that make sense&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not thought about it that way&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an interesting perspective&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see why you see it that way&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand why you say that&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear where you are coming from&#8221;</p>
<p>Be aware of your body language. Your words need to be congruent with your actions. 
  If you roll your eyes while acknowledging, they will not believe that you are 
  earnest.</p>
<h3>3. Pause briefly. Use silence effectively. </h3>
<p>Do not start out with &#8220;but, however, nevertheless&#8221;. These negative 
  filler words will negate the fact that you are trying to hear them out. They 
  often put people on the defensive and break down the communication.</p>
<h3>4. State your idea/opinion/point of view by starting out with something like:</h3>
<p>&#8220;In my experience, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My understanding is different. I &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you considered&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The literature/evidence says&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of &#8230;, I think&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The data I collected shows&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Be sure to include evidence, facts, examples, personal experience, or data 
  to substantiate your viewpoint.</p>
<p>By using the Agreeably Disagree technique, you preserve and strengthen the 
  relationship by showing the other person that you heard them and respect them 
  - even when you disagree.</p>
<h2><a name="five" id="five"></a>5 Ways to Foster Healthy Communication in Conflict 
  Situations</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/communications/about-gail-zack-anderson/" target="_blank">Gail

<p>We all want to approach conflict situations with clear, honest communication 
  that leads to a productive solution everyone can feel good about. But old habits 
  and norms sometimes block direct, open communication. Use these suggestions 
  as a checklist to see if you are communicating in the best possible way at your 
  organization. If you aren&#8217;t, an open discussion and agreement to use these 
  practices might be just what is needed to foster healthy, open communication 
  in conflict situations.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Talk directly to the person you need to talk with. Don&#8217;t go around 
    them. Don&#8217;t talk about them. Don&#8217;t email them. Talk to them face 
    to face if possible, or on the phone if necessary.</li>
  <li>Before engaging in a discussion, stop and ask, do we have the right people 
    in the room? If others are needed to resolve the issue or to add input, get 
    them into the discussion right away.</li>
  <li>When you are bringing up an issue or problem, be sure to also bring ideas 
    for a solution. Don&#8217;t just bring up issues to get them off your chest 
    or to complain, but rather come with either a request for help or possible 
    solutions.</li>
  <li>Seek to understand the other person, whether you or the other person is 
    bringing the conflict to light. How do their personal energies and styles 
    differ from yours? How are they emotionally or rationally engaging with you? 
    What are their perspectives? What are their perceptions?</li>
  <li>Use a simple model to help unravel the situation. Be sure you focus on the 
    goal of the interaction, the facts leading up to the situation, the possible 
    solutions, and the decisions you will make. Decide who will do what, and when. 
    Enlist others as needed to complete the action plan. Follow-up to see that 
    what you agreed on happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conflict in communication is universal; being human, we have different wants 
  and needs, and we don&#8217;t always communicate perfectly. Keep the lines of 
  communication open, and keep an open mind.</p>
