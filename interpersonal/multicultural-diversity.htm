<h2><a name="work" id="work"></a>Cultural Diversity Has a Huge Affect on Perceptions 
  of Leadership</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>In today’s highly diverse organizations, the ability to work in diverse cultures 
  is extremely important. An organization’s culture is driven by the values throughout 
  that organization. Employees need to feel that their values are recognized, 
  understood and respected. They need to feel that their ideas and concerns are 
  being heard. Those conditions create strong motivation and momentum for strong 
  performance in their jobs. Also, to help your employees to make meaningful decisions 
  – and to understand decisions that they may have made already – it is extremely 
  important that you have some understanding of the culture and values of the 
  organization. </p>
<p>It can be a major challenge to work in multicultural environments where others 
  have values, beliefs and certain conventions that are distinctly different from 
  yours. Differences between cultures can lead to increased resistance to leadership 
  because others might not understand and trust you. Those differences can hamper 
  the effectiveness of leadership, if not stop it altogether. </p>
<p>For example, Western cultures tend to be highly rational and value things that 
  are very useful in meeting a current need. They value rugged individualism and 
  competition. Some cultures might value patience, a sense of community and getting 
  along with others, and still others might value direct authority and privacy. 
  Some cultures may be overly deferential to the leader. Some cultures are deeply 
  guarded about private matters. </p>
<p>You and your employees might not even realize that you all have very different 
  values. There are no universal laws to ensure conformity in each culture. Because 
  of complexities in continually learning the cultures of your organization, it 
  is critical for you to continually be open to differences and ask for help from 
  your employees. </p>
<p>Although leading in multicultural organizations comes with its own unique challenges, 
  it comes with many benefits, as well. There are few other such powerful experiences 
  in which you can learn so much about people and organizations and also about 
  yourself. The following guidelines are intended to focus on the most practical 
  suggestions for working in multicultural environments. </p>
<h2><a name="basics" id="basics"></a>Basic Guidelines to Culturally-Specific Interactions</h2>
<p>The following guidelines might be useful, especially if you are new to the 
  organization.</p>
<h3>1. Be aware of your personal biases, style, preferences, lens and focus. </h3>
<p>This is critically important for successful leadership in any type of culture. 
  You make a major difference in your organization, whether you know it or not, 
  just by exposing it to your own nature and style of working. Thus, you need 
  to understand your nature. </p>
<h3>2. Realize that each part of an organization probably has a unique culture.</h3>
<p>For example, the secretarial staff might interact with each other in a manner 
  quite different from that of the marketing staff. In larger organizations, there 
  are often several differences, for example, between senior management and support 
  staff. </p>
<h3>3. Promptly convey to employees that you want to be sensitive to their culture.</h3>
<p>You should start in your first interaction with them. State that you recognize 
  that different people might work differently depending on their own personalities 
  and the culture of the overall organization. Ask them how you can understand 
  the nature of their organization. </p>
<h3>4. Consider getting a mentor, or representative, from the organization.</h3>
<p>Attempt to get someone from the organization to help you understand their culture 
  and how to work in a manner compatible with the culture of the organization. 
  This request is not a sign of weakness or lack of expertise; rather it is an 
  authentic request that better serves you and your employees. </p>
<h2><a name="culture" id="culture"></a>How to Learn Basics About a Culture</h2>
<p>Consider asking others to help you understand how each of the following aspects 
  might be unique in the culture of the organization. Key cultural aspects that 
  might affect your leadership include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Assertiveness</strong> Are members of your organization comfortable 
    being honest and direct with each other? If not, how can you still be as authentic 
    as possible and help them to be as authentic as possible, as well?</li>
  <li><strong>Body language</strong> Are there any specific cues that you can 
    notice to help you to sense how others are experiencing you?</li>
  <li><strong>Communication styles and direction</strong> Is communication fairly 
    direct and specific or more indirect and general? Does information flow mostly 
    “upward” to executives or is it widely disseminated? </li>
  <li><strong>Conflict</strong> Is conflict considered bad and avoided? Or is 
    conflict accepted as normal and directly addressed when it appears? <strong>Eye 
    contact</strong> Are members of the organization comfortable with sustained 
    eye contact during communication or not? </li>
  <li><strong>Gestures</strong> Are there any specific gestures that can cause 
    members of the organization discomfort or confusion?</li>
  <li><strong>Humor</strong> Is use of humor in the organization rather widespread? 
    Is there anything about the use of humor about which you should be aware?</li>
  <li><strong>Information collection</strong> Should you be aware of any potential 
    problems or use any certain precautions when conducting interviews or using 
    assessments?</li>
  <li><strong>Physical space</strong> For example, are members of your organization 
    quite conscious of having a minimum amount of space around them when they 
    work or speak with others?</li>
  <li> <strong>Power</strong> Are members attuned to certain people of power when 
    solving problems and making decisions? Is power based on authority and/or 
    respect? </li>
  <li> <strong>Silence</strong> Are members uncomfortable with silence during 
    communication? Or is it a common aspect of communicating in their workplace?</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong> Is time a precious commodity that seems to underlie 
    many activities, or can activities take as long as they need to take to be 
    done effectively?</li>
  <li><strong>Wording</strong> Are there certain words or phrasings that cause 
    discomfort when people from different cultures interact?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="hints" id="hints"></a>How to Talk About Management and Leadership 
  in Diverse Environments</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for people of any culture to experience confusion or engage 
  in protracted arguments about activities only to realize later on that they 
  have been in agreement all along – they had been using different definitions 
  for the same terms. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all of you are 
  “speaking the same language” about activities. The following guidelines are 
  most important when ensuring people continue to understand each other when talking 
  about management activities.</p>
<h3>Recognize Difference Between Terms That Refer to Results Versus Activities 
  to Produce Those Results</h3>
<p>It is common for people from different cultures to become confused because 
  different people are talking about results and others about the activities to 
  produce the results. For example, some people refer to the “plan” to be the 
  document, and others refer to the “plan” to be the activity of developing the 
  plan. It is usually most clear to use the term “plan” to refer to the document 
  itself, and use the term “planning” for the activities that produces the plan. 
</p>
<p>Here is another example. Inexperienced leaders sometimes assert that, because 
  employees do not have a tangible plan/document on the shelf and do not explicitly 
  reference the document on a regular basis, the employees are not doing planning. 
  That assertion can alienate the leaders from employees who believe that they 
  have been doing planning all along (but probably implicitly) and also have a 
  good plan – they just have not been calling their process “planning” and have 
  not produced a written plan document. Therefore, it is important for you to 
  recognize if your employees have their own form of a certain activity and how 
  that form is carried out in the organization. </p>
<h3>Be Able to Separate a Term from the Meaning of That Term</h3>
<p>If your conversations with others about management seem to get stuck or mired 
  in confusion, it often helps to separate terms from the intent of those terms. 
  For example: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Rather than talking about “vision” or “goals,” talk about “what” the business 
    wants to accomplish overall.</li>
  <li>Rather than talking about “strategies,” talk about “how” to accomplish “what” 
    you want to accomplish overall.</li>
  <li>Rather than talking about “action plans,” talk about “who is going to do 
    what, and by when.” </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hints for Talking with Others About Leadership Activities</h3>
<p>The topic of leadership has become so prominent and passionate with so many 
  people that it sometimes causes great confusion. Here are a few tips to help 
  people to “stay on the same page” when talking about leadership.</p>
<h4>1. Be clear about whether you are talking about leadership roles or traits.</h4>
<p>When people talk about leadership, they might be talking about traits of leaders, 
  such as being charismatic, influential and ethical. However, when others talk 
  about leadership, they might be talking about roles of leadership, such as the 
  Board Chair or the Chief Executive Officer. Both discussions are about leadership, 
  but both are about quite different aspects.</p>
<h4>2. Be clear about the domain of leadership about which you are talking.</h4>
<p>For example, when talking about leading yourself, you might be talking about 
  leadership skills, such as being assertive or having good time and stress management 
  skills. When talking about leading other individuals, you might be talking about 
  skills, such as coaching, delegating or mentoring. When talking about leading 
  groups, you might be talking about skills, such as facilitation or meeting management. 
  When talking about leading organizations, you might be talking about skills, 
  such as strategic planning or business planning. In each of these four cases, 
  the term “leadership” refers to different sets of skills. </p>
