<h2><a name="trust" id="trust"></a>Critical Ingredients for Building and Maintaining 
  Trust</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>There are numerous ingredients that must be present for there to be strong 
  and sustained trust in a relationship and in the workplace, for example, do 
  what you say you are going to do, always be clear and consistent in your assignments 
  and say what you mean. Different people together could probably generate one 
  long list. However, here are five of the most important ingredients.</p>
<h3>Authenticity</h3>
<p>Authenticity has become a very popular concept lately, especially as we hear 
  -- and try to follow -- a myriad of suggestions about how we &quot;should be&quot; 
  in our relationships and our work. Too many of us try to be something that we 
  aren't and so we inadvertently become inauthentic. People can sense when someone 
  is not being true to themselves or others. The concept of authenticity has become 
  so idealized and romanticized that it appears that a truly authentic person 
  would almost be that perfect person with no faults at all. Instead, perhaps 
  authenticity is best described as being honest with ourselves and others. See 
  <a href="http://managementhelp.org/personalwellness/authenticity.htm">Authenticity</a>.</p>
<h3>Empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy is the ability to relate to, and understand, others and sometimes to 
  even feel what they feel -- to &quot;walk in their shoes.&quot; Empathy is not 
  the same as sympathy, which is feeling pity or sorrow for another in discomfort. 
  You can empathize with someone without feeling sympathy for them. People trust 
  other people when they understand each other. Skills in empathy are the basis 
  for accurate and ongoing understanding between people. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/interpersonal/empathy-skills.htm">Empathy</a>.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>It's not enough to be real and have the ability to fully relate to others. 
  You also have to hear them, to really grasp and understand what others are trying 
  to convey to you. Without truly listening to others, you will not have their 
  trust. As much as we value skills in listening, too many of us don't have those 
  skills -- we listen more to ourselves than to others. There are some basic guidelines 
  that, if followed, can make a huge positive impact on your listening skills. 
  See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/listening-skills.htm">Listening</a>.</p>
<h3>Respectful Feedback</h3>
<p>Ongoing, successful communication is the foundation for building trust. That 
  communication should go beyond sharing information about the weather. It should 
  include our opinions and suggestions about the opinions and suggestions of others. 
  That feedback can be shared in very respectful ways that sustain the respect 
  and trust between participants. Similar to skills in listening, several guidelines, 
  if followed, can greatly enhance skills in sharing feedback. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/feedback.htm">Feedback</a>.</p>
<h3>Ethical</h3>
<p>Ethical behavior is always striving to do what's morally right for yourself 
  and others, particularly when times are tough and we're challenged to cut corners 
  to get things done quickly and cheaply. When people damage the trust between 
  them, it's usually because one or more of them have done something hurtful -- 
  they've done something that they would not want done to themselves. Many would 
  argue that a cornerstone of being ethical is the golden rule -- to do onto others 
  as you would have them do onto you. See <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessethics/index.htm">Ethics</a>.</p>
