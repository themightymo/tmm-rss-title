<h2><a name="biases" id="biases"></a>Understand Your Biases and How They Affect 
  Others</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>
<p>Your biases play a major role in how you perceive others. Your perceptions 
  are your reality, whether they are the reality for someone else or not. Differences 
  in perception between you and others can make the difference between successful 
  leadership and a complete disaster. So know your own biases! For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Do you believe that leaders should &#8220;take charge&#8221; and lead from 
    the front of the organization? If so, you might encounter frustration and 
    resistance when working with others who believe that leaders should lead from 
    the middle.</li>
  <li> Do you believe that others should just &#8220;shut up and listen to you?&#8221; 
    If so, they will probably only do what you say &#8211; and no more &#8211; 
    until their frustration is overwhelming and they leave. </li>
  <li>Do you believe that meetings should start and end on time? If so, you will 
    certainly be frustrated with people from cultures that place far less emphasis 
    on time. </li>
  <li>Do you believe that most problems would be solved if people just did &#8220;what 
    they were supposed to do&#8221;? What if people really do not know what they 
    are supposed to do?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="shoes" id="shoes"></a>How to Put Yourself &#8220;in Their Shoes&#8221; 
  &#8211; Skills in Empathy</h2>
<h4>What Is Empathy? Why Is It So Important?</h4>
<p>Empathy is the ability to accurately put yourself &#8220;in someone else&#8217;s 
  shoes&#8221; &#8211; to understand the other&#8217;s situation, perceptions 
  and feelings from their point of view &#8211; and to be able to communicate 
  that understanding back to the other person. Empathy is a critical skill for 
  you to have as a leader. It contributes to an accurate understanding of your 
  employees, their perceptions and concerns. It also enhances your communication 
  skills because you can sense what others want to know and if they are getting 
  it from you or not. Ideally, your employees can learn skills in empathy from 
  you, thereby helping them to become more effective leaders, managers and supervisors 
  themselves. </p>
<p>Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy. Sympathy involves actually being 
  affected by the other person&#8217;s perceptions, opinions and feelings. For 
  example, if an employee is frustrated and sad, the sympathetic leader would 
  experience the same emotions, resulting in the leader many times struggling 
  with the same issues as the employee. Thus, sympathy can actually get in the 
  way of effective leading. </p>
<h3>Guidelines to Develop Empathy</h3>
<h4>1. Experience the major differences among people.</h4>
<p>One of the best examples of strong skills in empathy is people who have traveled 
  or worked in multicultural environments. They have learned that the way they 
  see and experience things is often different from others. People with little 
  or no skills in empathy might have an intellectual awareness of these differences. 
  However, until they actually experience these differences, their skills in empathy 
  will probably remain quite limited. </p>
<h4>2. Learn to identify your own feelings &#8211; develop some emotional intelligence. 
</h4>
<p>Many of us are so &#8220;processed&#8221; and &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; about 
  feelings that we cannot readily identify them in ourselves, much less in others. 
  For example, we might perceive thoughts to be the same as feelings. So when 
  someone asks you how you feel about a project, you might respond, &#8220;I think 
  we have a lot to do.&#8221; Or, we might not distinguish between related emotions, 
  for example, between frustration and irritability or happiness and excitement.</p>
<h4>3. Regularly ask others for their perspectives and/or feelings regarding a 
  situation. </h4>
<p>Silently compare their responses to what you might have thought they would 
  be. This approach not only helps you to sharpen your own empathic skills, but 
  also helps you to learn more about your employees. <br />
