<h2>What's &quot;Risk Management&quot;?</h2>
Risk management is attempting to identify and then manage threats that could severely 
impact or bring down the organization. Generally, this involves reviewing operations 
of the organization, identifying potential threats to the organization and the 
likelihood of their occurrence, and then taking appropriate actions to address 
the most likely threats.
<p></p>
<p>Traditionally, risk management was thought of as mostly a matter of getting 
  the right insurance. Insurance coverage usually came in rather standard packages, 
  so people tended to not take risk management seriously. However, this impression 
  of risk management has changed dramatically. With the recent increase in rules 
  and regulations, employee-related lawsuits and reliance on key resources, risk 
  management is becoming a management practice that is every bit as important 
  as financial or facilities management.</p>
<p>There are several basic activities which a nonprofit organization can conduct 
  to dramatically reduce its chances of experiencing a catastrophic event that 
  ruins or severely impairs the organization.</p>
<p> <a name="anchor1744943" id="anchor1744943"></a> </p>
<h2>Conducting a Risk Management Assessment</h2>
Organizations should regularly undertake comprehensive, focused assessment of 
potential risks to the organization. This focused assessment should occur at least 
twice a year by a team of staff members representing all the major functions of 
the organization. The assessment should be carefully planned, documented and methodically 
carried out.
<p></p>
<p>The most common risks are typically of the types listed below. Comprehensive 
  checklists help a great deal to quickly review a wide range of organizational 
  aspects. Other aspects require more careful review.</p>
<p>Checklists in the following sections cover almost 140 considerations to ensure 
  a well run and highly protected organization.</p>
<p> <a name="anchor1800410" id="anchor1800410"></a> </p>
<h2>Best Protection: Good Management, Personnel Policies and Insurance</h2>
<h3>Good Management:</h3>
Efforts undertaken to manage an organization well also contributes to sound risk 
management. For example, a fully attentive board with a wide range of skills may 
be the most important guard against major threats to an organization. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/boards.htm">Governance 
(Board) Indicators</a> to assess the quality of your board. Also reference <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/evaluation.htm">Basic 
Evaluation of the Board.</a>
<p>Careful strategic planning and effective supervision helps ensure organizational 
  resources are closely aligned to accomplishing the organization's mission, and 
  that staff and volunteers are treated fairly and comply with rules and regulations. 
  See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/planning.htm">Planning 
  Indicators</a> and <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/nonprofits/human-resources.htm">Human 
  Resources Indicators.</a> </p>
<h3>Up-to-date, Reviewed Personnel Policies:</h3>
<p> Every organization must have up-to-date policies which guide the relationships 
  between staff and management. There has been a noticeable increase in lawsuits 
  regarding wrongful termination, harassment and discrimination, disagreements 
  about promotions or salary actions, etc. Parties to lawsuits include the organization, 
  management and/or board members. Therefore, personnel policies must be reviewed 
  at least once a year by an outside advisor who is an expert about all of the 
  employee-related laws and regulations. See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/personnelpolicies/index.htm">Policies 
  (Personnel).</a> </p>
<p>Be sure that management is well versed about the policies. Typically, courts 
  will interpret actions by organizational personnel as representative of the 
  organization's preferred course of action and superseding related, documented 
  policies.</p>
<h3>Well-designed Insurance Coverage:</h3>
<p> For a broad and basic overview of insurance, see <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/businessinsurance/liability-insurance.htm">Insurance 
  Against Liability</a> (legal/lia_insr.htm). You might first review this information 
  and then invite an insurance agent (or better yet, an insurance broker) to visit 
  your organization to provide you an overview of the types of insurance typically 
  sold to nonprofits. Note that many insurance professionals might not understand 
  the nature of nonprofits. Therefore, you might first ask a few people from fellow 
  nonprofits for references.</p>
<p>As dreadful as it may sound, you must schedule two hours sometime during the 
  year to close your door and study your insurance policies. Note <i>any</i> questions 
  and pose them to your insurance professional. Ask him or her to provide you 
  a written, clear description regarding any ambiguities and to do so on company 
  letterhead with his or her signature.</p>
<p>Note that Directors and Officers Insurance (D &amp; O, and covered in the above 
  &quot;Insurance Against Liabilities&quot; section) is increasingly considered 
  because of the increasing number of lawsuits. In addition, D &amp; O insurance 
  helps attract highly experienced board members. Be sure your D &amp; O insurance 
  covers &quot;insured vs. insured&quot; which covers employee-related lawsuits 
  and also covers ongoing costs to address a lawsuit (rather than paying only 
  when the outcome of a lawsuit has been decided).</p>
<h2><a name="protect" id="protect"></a>Protecting Against Fraud, Forgery, Theft 
  and Terrorism</h2>
<h3>Have up-to-date, Board-approved personnel policies for employees.</h3>
<p>Personnel policies specify how personnel should be hired, supervised and fired 
  in accordance with employment laws that ensure fair, equitable and legally compliant 
  treatment of others. Personnel, particularly those who supervise others, should 
  be trained on the policies.</p>
<h3> Conduct background checks on potential new hires.</h3>
<p>Background checks can detect if a person has committed crimes, major or minor 
  in nature, which might suggest tendencies for how the person will act in the 
  workplace.</p>
<p>Conduct Board orientations once a year for members. </p>
<p>Board orientations make members aware of the unique aspects of the Board and 
  the organization, including the Board&#8217;s policies, for example, about ethics, 
  conflict-of-interest, whistleblowers and document retention/destruction.</p>
<h3> Establish a Whistleblower Policy.</h3>
<p>The policy should specify how Board members, employees and others could safely 
  report that an alleged or actual organizational behavior or practice is illegal, 
  unethical or inappropriate, without retaliation to the whistleblower.</p>
<h3> Establish a Board Ethics Policy.</h3>
<p>The policy should specify the types of behaviors to conduct and/or to avoid 
  in order to ensure that Board members conduct themselves in a manner that treats 
  others fairly, equitably and that is legally compliant. </p>
<h3>Establish up-to-date, Board-approved fiscal policies and procedures. </h3>
<p>These procedures ensure that the activities in financial management are conducted 
  in a highly thorough, accurate and useful manner that also minimizes the likelihood 
  of malfeasance, including theft, fraud or misappropriation of funds. </p>
<h3>Annually conduct a financial audit and/or review.</h3>
<p>The audit or review verifies the usefulness and accuracy of some or all aspects 
  of financial management and, thus, greatly increases the likelihood that financial 
  numbers and reports are indeed accurate. </p>

<p> <a name="anchor1745820" id="anchor1745820"></a> </p>
<h2>Resource Management (people, computers, records and facilities)</h2>
<h3>People:</h3>
This aspect of risk management is often overlooked. Each key role in an organization 
should have some type of resource to back up performance of that role. For example, 
another person in the organization should have general understanding of another 
person's role in case that other person for some reason is not able to perform 
the role. The use of up-to-date job descriptions, todo lists and receiving regular 
status reports both help to ensure understanding of how others carry out their 
roles. Have a staff member back up another member who is on vacation. During staff 
meetings, have a staff member give a presentation about their role and how they 
carry it out. Ensure that each critical role has at least one backup person who 
can step in to conduct the role. The backup assignment should be part of the person's 
job description to help the person take the assignment seriously.
<p></p>
<h3>Computers:</h3>
<p> See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/computers/security.htm#anchor106567">Basic 
  Computer Security</a> </p>
<h3>Records:</h3>
<p> 1. Record all records in a central location and well labeled.<br />
  2. Keep critical documents (e.g., board minutes, leases and contracts, Articles 
  of Incorporation, ByLaws, letter from the IRS granting tax-exempt status, etc.) 
  preferably in a fireproof box.<br />
  3. Personnel files should be locked in desk drawers with access granted to the 
  Executive Director and his or her assistant.<br />
  4. Allocate two hours each year for staff to audit the agency's documentation 
  for relevance, adequate labeling and reasonable organization.</p>
<h3>General Facilities:</h3>
<p> 1. Always lock your doors. This seems obvious, but too many organizations 
  fail to do so.<br />
  2. Ensure your fire protection systems are fully functional by scheduling to 
  test fire alarms twice a year or demanding that your facility's owner test alarms 
  twice a year. Note that certain electrical equipment can be severely damaged 
  from water sprinklers. Arrange adequate covering or arrangement to minimize 
  water seepage if overhead sprinklers open up.<br />
  3. Conduct inspections twice a year, including to:<br />
  a) Inspect floors for ripped carpets<br />
  b) look for cables or wires laying on the floor (tape over them if you have 
  to)<br />
  c) Notice any electrical outlets with black soot hear outlets (this indicates 
  electrical shortages)<br />
  d) Ask all staff if their office accommodations are sufficient, e.g., their 
  chairs are entirely comfortable (tilted correctly for their backs and at the 
  right heights), is lighting sufficient for desk and computer work, etc.<br />
  e) Notice any heavy items on or near the floor which staff must continually 
  stoop to lift, e.g., boxes of paper for the copier or printers; open boxes before 
  they're set on the floor or stack heavy items in a storage room on a shelf<br />
  f) Ensure all doors have fully functional door knobs (it's amazing how long 
  people can tolerate something as small as a knob that continually jams so the 
  door is difficult to open)<br />
  g) Ensure there is a well-stocked first-aid kit available to all staff<br />
  h) Post emergency numbers on the wall near the central phone <br />
  i) During the winter, ensure adequate ice removal, e.g., spread sand over ice 
  or use salt to melt ice<br />
  j) Schedule ten minutes in a staff meeting once a year for the entire staff 
  to reflect on the quality of the facilities</p>
