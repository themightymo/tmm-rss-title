<p>One of the major functions of management is planning. There
are numerous types of plans, for example, business plans, strategic
plans, project plans, program plans -- and on and on and on. (The
library topic &quot;Planning&quot; describes many of these types
of plans in business and management.) Most planning processes
typically use the same &quot;core&quot; sequence of planning activities.
The complexity and duplication of this &quot;core&quot; sequence
depends very much on the nature and needs of the organization.</p>

<h2>&quot;Core&quot;
Sequence of Planning Information</h2>
At the core of most planning processes is the same
basic sequence of planning information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What goals are to be achieved (Goals are usually major accomplishments,
  results, outcomes, or &quot;end states&quot; to be achieved.
  It's ideal if goals can be worded such that it's obvious whether
  they've been reached or not.)</li>
  <li>Who's responsible to reach the goal</li>
  <li>How they will reach the goal (that is, what strategies, or
  methods, they will use)</li>
  <li>When they will reach the goal</li>
</ul>

<p>The complexity of the sequence depends very much on the nature
and needs of the organization.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor1050862"></a>
<h2>Sequence for
a Large Organization</h2>

The strategic planning document for a large, multi-national
organization can be many pages long, with numerous overall goals,
associated strategies/methods to reach the goals, associated objectives/milestones
along the way while implementing the methods, and listings of
who's responsible to achieve each objective and by when.</p>

<p>In the various divisions in that large company, the above sequence
might be repeated again, but on a somewhat smaller scale. In departments
in the division, the above sequence might be repeated again, but
on a somewhat smaller scale, etc.</p>

<p>The following sequence might be typical to each of top levels
of this type of large organization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each overall goal that should have be reached when the plan
  is implemented (for levels other than the very top level of the
  organization, each overall goal is usually directly associated
  with overall goals of the next-higher-up level of the organization)</li>
  <li>Who is primarily responsible to reach each overall goal</li>
  <li>Overall methods/strategies to be used to reach each overall goal</li>
  <li>Who is primarily responsible to implement each method/strategy</li>
  <li>Specific objectives/milestones to be achieved along way to
  each overall goal</li>
  <li>Who is primarily responsible to achieve each objective</li>
  <li>Specific methods/tactics to be used to achieve each objective</li>
  <li>Who is primarily responsible to implement each method/tactic</li>
  <li>For each objective, a date when the objective should be reached</li>
  <li>For each objective, a section to provide status on the progress
  toward reaching that objective</li>
  <li>For each objective, a section to provide comments about status.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h2>Sequence in
a Small Organization</h2>

A small organization might use the following sequence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each overall goal that should have be reached when the plan
  is implemented</li>
  <li>Who is primarily responsible to reach each overall goal</li>
  <li>Overall methods/strategies to be used to reach each overall
  goal</li>
  <li>Specific objectives/milestones to be achieved along way to
  each overall goal</li>
  <li>For each objective, a date when the objective should be reached</li>
  <li>For each objective, a section to provide status on the progress
  toward reaching that objective</li>
  <li>For each objective, a section to provide comments about status.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Outline
of Planning Document</h2>

<h4>Executive Summary</h4>

<ul>
  <li>One- to two-page section that highlights important points
  from the plan (this summary is <i>not</i> a listing of the plan's
  contents -- that's a Table of Contents)</li>
  <li>Purpose of the plan</li>
  <li>Results the plan is intended to achieve when completed</li>
  <li>Who has primary responsibility for ensuring the plan is completed</li>
  <li>Key roles of others in the organization, for example, for
  authorization, reviews, etc.</li>
  <li>When the plan will be started and completed</li>
  <li>Might include who has copies of the plan</li>
  <li>Might include who can be contacted with questions, etc.</li>
  <li>Might include descriptions of who was involved in the planning
  and what planning process was used</li>
  <li>Might include <i>very brief</i> wording about structure of
  plan and how to use it</li>
</ul>
