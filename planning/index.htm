<p>One of the most common sets of activities in the management
is planning. Very simply put, planning is setting the direction
for something -- some system -- and then guiding the system to
follow the direction. There are many kinds of planning in organizations.
Common to these many kinds of planning are various phases of planning
and guidelines for carrying them out as effectively as possible.
Information in this document can be referenced as a basis from
which to carry out various kinds of planning, ranging from highly
complex to simple and basic. (The library topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/planning/index.htm"
class="textlink">Planning</a> describes a wide variety of plans.)
To help make the following information applicable to as many situations
as possible, the scope of the following planning information is
to the &quot;system&quot;, which is fully explained below. The
following process should be customized by planners to the meet
the needs and nature of the planners and their organizations.</p>

<h2>Planning in its Larger Context</h2>

<h3>Working Backwards Through Any &quot;System&quot;</h3>

<p>Before we jump into the typical phases in the standard &quot;generic&quot;
planning process, let's stand back and minute and briefly look
at the role of planning in its overall context. This is more than
an academic exercise -- understanding this overall context for
planning can greatly help the reader to design and carry out the
planning process in almost planning application.</p>

<p>One of the most common sets of activities in the management
is planning. Very simply put, planning is setting the direction
for something -- some system -- and then working to ensure the
system follows that direction. Systems have inputs, processes,
outputs and outcomes. To explain, <b>inputs</b> to the system
include resources such as raw materials, money, technologies and
people. These inputs go through a <b>process</b> where they're
aligned, moved along and carefully coordinated, ultimately to
achieve the goals set for the system. <b>Outputs</b> are tangible
results produced by processes in the system, such as products
or services for consumers. Another kind of result is <b>outcomes</b>,
or benefits for consumers, e.g., jobs for workers, enhanced quality
of life for customers, etc. Systems can be the entire organization,
or its departments, groups, processes, etc. (For an overview of
various systems in organizations, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/definition.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Definition of Organization</a> and <a 
href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/metaphor.htm" class="textlink">Various
Ways to Look at Organizations</a>.)</p>

<p>Whether the system is an organization, department, business,
project, etc., the process of planning includes planners working
backwards through the system. They start from the results (outcomes
and outputs) they prefer and work backwards through the system
to identify the processes needed to produce the results. Then
they identify what inputs (or resources) are needed to carry out
the processes.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1185111"></a></p>

<h3>Quick Look at Some Basic Terms</h3>

<p>Planning typically includes use of the following basic terms.</p>

<p>NOTE: It's not critical to grasp completely accurate definitions
of each of the following terms. It's more important for planners
to have a basic sense for the difference between goals/objectives
(results) and strategies/tasks (methods to achieve the results).</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>Goals are specific accomplishments that must be accomplished
in total, or in some combination, in order to achieve some larger,
overall result preferred from the system, for example, the mission
of an organization. (Going back to our reference to systems, goals
are outputs from the system.)</p>

<h4>Strategies or Activities</h4>

<p>These are the methods or processes required in total, or in
some combination, to achieve the goals. (Going back to our reference
to systems, strategies are processes in the system.)</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<p>Objectives are specific accomplishments that must be accomplished
in total, or in some combination, to achieve the goals in the
plan. Objectives are usually &quot;milestones&quot; along the
way when implementing the strategies.</p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>

<p>Particularly in small organizations, people are assigned various
tasks required to implement the plan. If the scope of the plan
is very small, tasks and activities are often essentially the
same.</p>

<h4>Resources (and Budgets)</h4>

<p>Resources include the people, materials, technologies, money,
etc., required to implement the strategies or processes. The costs
of these resources are often depicted in the form of a budget.
(Going back to our reference to systems, resources are input to
the system.)</p>

<h2>Basic Overview of Typical Phases in Planning</h2>

<p>Whether the system is an organization, department, business,
project, etc., the basic planning process typically includes similar
nature of activities carried out in similar sequence. The phases
are carried out carefully or -- in some cases -- intuitively,
for example, when planning a very small, straightforward effort.
The complexity of the various phases (and their duplication throughout
the system) depend on the scope of the system. For example, in
a large corporation, the following phases would be carried out
in the corporate offices, in each division, in each department,
in each group, etc.</p>

<p>NOTE: Different groups of planners might have different names
for the following activities and groups them differently. However,
the nature of the activities and their general sequence remains
the same.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following are typical phases in planning. They do
<i>not</i> comprise the complete, ideal planning process.</p>

<p>1. <b>Reference Overall Singular Purpose (&quot;Mission&quot;)
or Desired Result from System</b><br />
During planning, planners have in mind (consciously or unconsciously)
some overall purpose or result that the plan is to achieve. For
example, during strategic planning, it's critical to reference
the mission, or overall purpose, of the organization.</p>

<p>2. <b>Take Stock Outside and Inside the System</b><br />
This &quot;taking stock&quot; is always done to some extent, whether
consciously or unconsciously. For example, during strategic planning,
it's important to conduct an environmental scan. This scan usually
involves considering various driving forces, or major influences,
that might effect the organization.</p>

<p>3. <b>Analyze the Situation</b><br />
For example, during strategic planning, planners often conduct
a &quot;SWOT analysis&quot;. (SWOT is an acronym for considering
the organization's strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities
and threats faced by the organization.) During this analysis,
planners also can use a variety of assessments, or methods to
&quot;measure&quot; the health of systems.</p>

<p>4. <b>Establish Goals</b><br />
Based on the analysis and alignment to the overall mission of
the system, planners establish a set of goals that build on strengths
to take advantage of opportunities, while building up weaknesses
and warding off threats.</p>

<p>5. <b>Establish Strategies to Reach Goals</b><br />
The particular strategies (or methods to reach the goals) chosen
depend on matters of affordability, practicality and efficiency.</p>

<p>6. <b>Establish Objectives Along the Way to Achieving Goals</b><br />
Objectives are selected to be timely and indicative of progress
toward goals.</p>

<p>7. <b>Associate Responsibilities and Time Lines With Each Objective</b><br />
Responsibilities are assigned, including for implementation of
the plan, and for achieving various goals and objectives. Ideally,
deadlines are set for meeting each responsibility.</p>

<p>8. <b>Write and Communicate a Plan Document</b><br />
The above information is organized and written in a document which
is distributed around the system.</p>

<p>9. <b>Acknowledge Completion and Celebrate Success</b><br />
This critical step is often ignored -- which can eventually undermine
the success of many of your future planning efforts. The purpose
of a plan is to address a current problem or pursue a development
goal. It seems simplistic to assert that you should acknowledge
if the problem was solved or the goal met. However, this step
in the planning process is often ignored in lieu of moving on
the next problem to solve or goal to pursue. Skipping this step
can cultivate apathy and skepticism -- even cynicism -- in your
organization. Don't skip this step.</p>

<h2>Guidelines to Ensure Successful Planning and Implementation</h2>

<p>A common failure in many kinds of planning is that the plan
is never really implemented. Instead, all focus is on writing
a plan document. Too often, the plan sits collecting dust on a
shelf. Therefore, most of the following guidelines help to ensure
that the planning process is carried out completely and is implemented
completely -- or, deviations from the intended plan are recognized
and managed accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1790214"></a></p>

<h3>Involve the Right People in the Planning Process</h3>

<p>Going back to the reference to systems, it's critical that
all parts of the system continue to exchange feedback in order
to function effectively. This is true no matter what type of system.
When planning, get input from everyone who will responsible to
carry out parts of the plan, along with representative from groups
who will be effected by the plan. Of course, people also should
be involved in they will be responsible to review and authorize
the plan.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1775515"></a></p>

<h3>Write Down the Planning Information and Communicate it Widely</h3>

<p>New managers, in particular, often forget that others don't
know what these managers know. Even if managers do communicate
their intentions and plans verbally, chances are great that others
won't completely hear or understand what the manager wants done.
Also, as plans change, it's extremely difficult to remember who
is supposed to be doing what and according to which version of
the plan. Key stakeholders (employees, management, board members,
funders, investor, customers, clients, etc.) may request copies
of various types of plans. Therefore, it's critical to write plans
down and communicate them widely. For more guidelines in this
regard, see<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/writing-plan.htm">Basics
of Writing and Communicating the Plan</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1384873"></a></p>

<h3>Goals and Objectives Should Be SMARTER</h3>

<p>SMARTER is an acronym, that is, a word composed by joining
letters from different words in a phrase or set of words. In this
case, a SMARTER goal or objective is:</p>

<h4>Specific:</h4>

<p>For example, it's difficult to know what someone should be
doing if they are to pursue the goal to &quot;work harder&quot;.
It's easier to recognize &quot;Write a paper&quot;.</p>

<h4>Measurable:</h4>

<p>It's difficult to know what the scope of &quot;Writing a paper&quot;
really is. It's easier to appreciate that effort if the goal is
&quot;Write a 30-page paper&quot;.</p>

<h4>Acceptable:</h4>

<p>If I'm to take responsibility for pursuit of a goal, the goal
should be acceptable to me. For example, I'm not likely to follow
the directions of someone telling me to write a 30-page paper
when I also have to five other papers to write. However, if you
involve me in setting the goal so I can change my other commitments
or modify the goal, I'm much more likely to accept pursuit of
the goal as well.</p>

<h4>Realistic:</h4>

<p>Even if I do accept responsibility to pursue a goal that is
specific and measurable, the goal won't be useful to me or others
if, for example, the goal is to &quot;Write a 30-page paper in
the next 10 seconds&quot;.</p>

<h4>Time frame:</h4>

<p>It may mean more to others if I commit to a realistic goal
to &quot;Write a 30-page paper in one week&quot;. However, it'll
mean more to others (particularly if they are planning to help
me or guide me to reach the goal) if I specify that I will write
one page a day for 30 days, rather than including the possibility
that I will write all 30 pages in last day of the 30-day period.</p>

<h4>Extending:</h4>

<p>The goal should stretch the performer's capabilities. For example,
I might be more interested in writing a 30-page paper if the topic
of the paper or the way that I write it will extend my capabilities.</p>

<h4>Rewarding:</h4>

<p>I'm more inclined to write the paper if the paper will contribute
to an effort in such a way that I might be rewarded for my effort.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1800762"></a></p>

<h3>Build in Accountability (Regularly Review Who's Doing What
and By When?)</h3>

<p>Plans should specify who is responsible for achieving each
result, including goals and objectives. Dates should be set for
completion of each result, as well. Responsible parties should
regularly review status of the plan. Be sure to have someone of
authority &quot;sign off&quot; on the plan, including putting
their signature on the plan to indicate they agree with and support
its contents. Include responsibilities in policies, procedures,
job descriptions, performance review processes, etc.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1446084"></a></p>

<h3>Note Deviations from the Plan and Replan Accordingly</h3>

<p>It's OK to deviate from the plan. The plan is not a set of
rules. It's an overall guideline. As important as following the
plan is noticing deviations and adjusting the plan accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1446322"></a></p>

<h3>Evaluate Planning Process and the Plan</h3>

<p>During the planning process, regularly collect feedback from
participants. Do they agree with the planning process? If not,
what don't they like and how could it be done better? In large,
ongoing planning processes (such as strategic planning, business
planning, project planning, etc.), it's critical to collect this
kind of feedback regularly.</p>

<p>During regular reviews of implementation of the plan, assess
if goals are being achieved or not. If not, were goals realistic?
Do responsible parties have the resources necessary to achieve
the goals and objectives? Should goals be changed? Should more
priority be placed on achieving the goals? What needs to be done?</p>

<p>Finally, take 10 minutes to write down how the planning process
could have been done better. File it away and read it the next
time you conduct the planning process.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1384392"></a></p>

<h3>Recurring Planning Process is at Least as Important as Plan
Document</h3>

<p>Far too often, primary emphasis is placed on the plan document.
This is extremely unfortunate because the real treasure of planning
is the planning process itself. During planning, planners learn
a great deal from ongoing analysis, reflection, discussion, debates
and dialogue around issues and goals in the system. Perhaps there
is no better example of misplaced priorities in planning than
in business ethics. Far too often, people put emphasis on written
codes of ethics and codes of conduct. While these documents certainly
are important, at least as important is conducting ongoing communications
around these documents. The ongoing communications are what sensitize
people to understanding and following the values and behaviors
suggested in the codes.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1565059"></a></p>

<h3>Nature of the Process Should Be Compatible to Nature of Planners</h3>

<p>A prominent example of this type of potential problem is when
planners don't prefer the &quot;top down&quot; or &quot;bottom
up&quot;, &quot;linear&quot; type of planning (for example, going
from general to specific along the process of an environmental
scan, SWOT analysis, mission/vision/values, issues and goals,
strategies, objectives, timelines, etc.) There are other ways
to conduct planning. For an overview of various methods, see (in
the following, the models are applied to the strategic planning
process, but generally are eligible for use elsewhere):<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/models.htm">Basic
Overview of Various Planning Models</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1435690"></a></p>

<h3>Critical -- But Frequently Missing Step -- Acknowledgement
and Celebration of Results</h3>

<p>It's easy for planners to become tired and even cynical about
the planning process. One of the reasons for this problem is very
likely that far too often, emphasis is placed on achieving the
results. Once the desired results are achieved, new ones are quickly
established. The process can seem like having to solve one problem
after another, with no real end in sight. Yet when one really
thinks about it, it's a major accomplishment to carefully analyze
a situation, involve others in a plan to do something about it,
work together to carry out the plan and actually see some results.
So acknowledge this -- celebrate your accomplishment!
