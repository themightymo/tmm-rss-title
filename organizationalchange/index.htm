<p>Today, teams and organizations face rapid change like never before. Globalization 
  has increased the markets and opportunities for more growth and revenue. However, 
  increasingly diverse markets have a wide variety of needs and expectations that 
  must be understood if they are to become strong customers and collaborators. 
  Concurrently, scrutiny of stakeholders has increased as some executives have 
  been convicted of illegal actions in their companies, and the compensation of 
  executives seems to be increasing while wages of others seems to be decreasing 
  or leveling off. Thus, the ability to manage change, while continuing to meet 
  the needs of stakeholders, is a very important skill required by today's leaders 
  and managers.</p>
<p>NOTE: This site distinguishes the difference between &quot;organizational development&quot; 
  and &quot;Organization Development.&quot; The former phrase refers to the nature 
  and scope of change in organizations, i.e., the change is to the entire organization 
  or to a significant portion of the organization. The latter phrase refers to 
  a field of well-trained people with expertise in guiding successful organizational 
  development. </p>

<h2>FOUNDATIONS FOR MANAGING CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONS</h2>

<a name="anchor515854"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a name="anchor61645"></a>
<h3>Why Is It Critical for Leaders and
Managers to Be Successful at Organizational Change? Because It's
Their Job</h3>

<p>Significant organizational change occurs, for example, when
an organization changes its overall strategy for success, adds
or removes a major section or practice, and/or wants to change
the very nature by which it operates. It also occurs when an organization
evolves through various life cycles, just like people must successfully
evolve through life cycles. For organizations to develop, they
often must undergo significant change at various points in their
development. That's why the topic of organizational change and
development has become widespread in communications about business,
organizations, leadership and management.</p>

<p>Leaders and managers continually make efforts to accomplish
successful and significant change -- it's inherent in their jobs.
Some are very good at this effort (probably more than we realize),
while others continually struggle and fail. That's often the difference
between people who thrive in their roles and those that get shuttled
around from job to job, ultimately settling into a role where
they're frustrated and ineffective. There are many schools with
educational programs about organizations, business, leadership
and management. Unfortunately, there still are not enough schools
with programs about how to analyze organizations, identify critically
important priorities to address (such as systemic problems or
exciting visions for change) and then undertake successful and
significant change to address those priorities. This Library topic
aims to improve that situation.</p>

<a name="anchor35638"></a>
<h3>Don't Do Change for the Sake of
Change -- Do Change to Enhance Organizational Performance</h3>

<p>Organizational change is undertaken to improve the performance
of the organization or a part of the organization, for example,
a process or team. Therefore, it's very useful for the reader
to scan the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/index.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Performance</a> in the Library,
to get a basic sense of an overall framework to enhance the performance
of an organization. Then return to this topic on organizational
change to learn more about how to guide successful change within
that framework.</p>

<a name="anchor132381"></a>
<h3>Focus and Scope of This Library
Topic</h3>

<p>The focus of this Library topic is on principles and practices
to successfully accomplish significant change in organizations.Successful
organizational change can be quite difficult to accomplish --
it can be like trying to change a person's habits. Fortunately,
there is an increasing body of research, practice and tools from
which we all can learn. A major goal of this Library topic is
to make this body of information much more accessible to many
-- to give the reader more clear perspective on overall organizational
change and development, along with sufficient understanding to
begin applying principles and practices for successful change
in their roles and organizations.</p>

<p>The following resources are not sufficient to guide a large,
comprehensive and detailed organizational change effort -- that
amount of resources comprises a significantly sized book -- and
besides, there is no standard procedure for guiding change. However,
the following resources might be sufficient to provide the reader
at least a framework that takes him or her from which to begin
guiding change in smaller efforts for organizational change --
and then to begin to learn more.</p>

<p>There are many approaches to guiding change -- some planned,
structured and explicit, while others are more organic, unfolding
and implicit. Some approaches work from the future to the present,
for example, involving visioning and then action planning about
how to achieve that vision. Other approaches work from the present
to the future, for example, identifying current priorities (issues
and/or goals) and then action planning about to address those
priorities (the action research approach is one example). Different
people often have very different -- and strong -- opinions about
how change should be conducted. Thus, it is likely that some will
disagree with some of the content in this topic. That's what makes
this topic so diverse, robust and vital for us all.</p>

<h2>Broad Context for Organizational
Change and Development</h2>

<a name="anchor62595"></a>
<h3>Understanding Organizations, Leadership
and Management</h3>

<p>To really understand organizational change and begin guiding
successful change efforts, the change agent should have at least
a broad understanding of the context of the change effort. This
includes understanding the basic systems and structures in organizations,
including their typical terms and roles. This requirement applies
to the understanding of leadership and management of the organizations,
as well. That is why graduate courses in business often initially
include a course or some discussion on organizational theory.
This topic includes several links to help you gain this broad
understanding. The following links (broadly reviewed in the following
order) might be helpful to establish some sense about organizations,
and their leadership and management. <br />

and structures)</a><br />

<a href="http://managementhelp.org/management/index.htm">Introduction
to Management (to get a sense about planning, organizing and controlling
resources)</a></p>

<a name="anchor63073"></a>
<h3>Understanding Organizational Performance
Management</h3>

<p>Organizational change should not be conducted for the sake
of change. Organizational change efforts should be geared to improve
the performance of organizations and the people in those organizations.
Therefore, it's useful to have some understanding of what is meant
by &quot;performance&quot; and the various methods to manage performance
in organizations. <br />

of Performance Management</a><br />

<a href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/evaluating.htm">Group
Performance Management</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/index.htm">Organizational
Performance Management</a></p>

<p>It's also to have some sense of what it takes for an organization
to be sustainable. See<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalsustainability/index.htm">Organizational
Sustainability</a></p>

<a name="anchor66444"></a>
<h3>Systems Thinking</h3>

<p>The past few decades have seen an explosion in the number of
very useful tools to help change agents to effectively explore,
understand and communicate about organizations, as well as to
guide successful change in those organizations. Tools from systems
theory and systems thinking especially are a major breakthrough.
Even if the change agent is not an expert about systems theory
and thinking, even a basic understanding can cultivate an entire
new way of working. The following link is to many well-organized
resources about systems thinking and tools.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/systems/index.htm">Systems
Thinking</a></p>

<p>In that topic, the subtopic, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/systems/index.htm#anchor296937"
class="textlink">Systems Thinking in Organizations</a>, is particularly
useful to understand.</p>

<h2>Professionalism for Practitioners
Focused on Organizational Change and Development</h2>

<a name="anchor63754"></a>
<h3>About the Field of Organization
Development (OD)</h3>

<p>The field of Organization Development is focused on improving the effectiveness 
  of organizations and the people in those organizations. OD has a rich history 
  of research and practice regarding change in organizations. Why not learn from 
  that history? This topic includes links for the reader to get a basic understanding 
  of the overall purpose of the field and also provides many resources from which 
  to learn more.</p>
<p>NOTE: This site distinguishes the difference between &quot;organizational development&quot; 
  and 'Organization Development.&quot; The former phrase refers to the nature 
  and scope of change in organizations, i.e., the change is to the entire organization 
  or to a significant portion of the organization. The latter phrase refers to 
  a field of well-trained people with expertise in guiding successful organizational 
  development. <br />

<h3>Understanding Yourself as an Instrument
of Change</h3>

<p>Your nature and the way you choose to work has significant
impact on your client's organization, whether you know it or not.
You cannot separate yourself from your client's organization,
as if you are some kind of detached observer. You quickly become
part of your client's system -- the way the people and processes
in the organization work with each other on a recurring basis.
Thus, it is critical that you have a good understanding of yourself,
including your biases (we all have them), how you manage feedback
and conflict, how you like to make decisions and solve problems,
how you naturally view organizations, your skills as a consultant,
etc. The following articles will help you gain understanding of
yourself, how you might prefer to work and how you actually work.<br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/fp-self.pdf">Understanding
Yourself as Instrument of Change (ends with a self-assessment)</a></p>

<a name="anchor65949"></a>
<h3>Consulting -- Professionalism and
Ethics</h3>

<p>Nowadays, with the complex challenges faced by organizations
and the broad diversity of values, perspectives and opinions among
the members of those organizations, it's vital that change agents
work from a strong set of principles to ensure they operate in
a highly effective and ethical manner.</p>

<p>Before reviewing the resources listed below, do a quick can
of the list of subtopics in the overall topic of Consulting to
get a sense for the broad field of consulting, because people
who work to guide and support organizational change are consultants.

<h2>Overview of Change Management</h2>

<h3>Clearing Up the Language About Organizational
Change and Development</h3>

<p>There are several phrases regarding organizational change and
development that look and sound a lot alike, but have different
meanings. As a result of the prominence of the topic, there seems
to be increasingly different interpretations of some of these
phrases, while others are used interchangeably. Without at least
some sense of the differences between these phrases, communications
about organizational change and development can be increasingly
vague, confusing and frustrating.<br />

<h3>Specific Types of Organizational
Change</h3>

<p>There are different overall types of organizational change,
including planned versus unplanned, organization-wide versus change
primarily to one part of the organization, incremental (slow,
gradual change) versus transformational (radical, fundamental),
etc.. Knowing which types of change you are doing helps all participants
to retain scope and perspective during the many complexities and
frequent frustrations during change. Read the following article
to understand more about each type of change.<br />

<h3>Key Roles During Change Management</h3>

<p>Successful change efforts often include several key roles,
including the initiator, champion, change agent, sponsor and leaders.
The following article describes each of these roles. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/misc/roles-during-change.pdf">Major
Roles During Change and Capacity Building</a></p>

<p>Organization-wide change in corporations should involve the
Board of Directors. Whether their members are closely involved
in the change or not, they should at least be aware of the change
project and monitor if the results are being achieved or not.<br />

<h3>Example of a Philosophy and Some
Perspectives and Models From Which to Manage Change</h3>

<p>This section helps the reader to appreciate the diversity of
ways that people can approach the management of change in organizations.</p>

<h4>Appreciative Inquiry -- Example of Overall Philosophy From
Which to Manage Change</h4>

<p>Appreciative Inquiry is a recent and powerful breakthrough
in organizational change and development. It's based on the philosophy
that &quot;problems&quot; are often caused as much by our perception
of them as problems as by other influencing factors. The philosophy
has spawned a strong movement that, in turn, has generated an
increasing number of models, tools and tips, most of which seem
to build from the positive perceptions (visions, fantasies, wishes
and stories) of those involved in the change effort. <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/businessresearch/appreciative-inquiry.htm">Appreciative
Inquiry</a></p>

<h4>Various Perspectives From Which to Manage Change</h4>

<p>The following articles provide ways or perspectives from which
to manage change. <br />

Change Management Strategies</a><br />

target="_blank">An Educational Process for Change and Improvement
Efforts</a></p>

<h4>Various Models for Change Management</h4>

<p>There are numerous well-organized approaches (or models) from
which to manage a change effort. Some of the approaches have been
around for many years -- we just haven't thought of them as such.
For example, many organizations undertake strategic planning.
The implementation of strategic planning, when done in a systematic,
cyclical and explicit approach, is strategic management. Strategic
management is also one model for ensuring the success of a change
effort. The following links provide more perspectives on approaches
to managing change. (Note that, with the maturation of the field
of OD, there are now more strong opinions about which are change
management approaches and which are not -- there seems to be no
standard interpretation yet.)<br />

<p>Many people would agree that traditional models of organizational
performance management are also models for managing change.<br />

<h3>Various Perspectives on Organizational
Change</h3>

<p>There is now a vast array of highly reflective articles about
the nature of change. Many of these articles focus primarily on
the role of leaders during change. However, it's not likely that
the reader can gain useful frameworks for change primarily from
reading numerous reflective articles, so be sure to review at
least some of the other articles in each subtopic in this overall
Library topic. You can learn a lot about the overall design and
approaches to change even by scanning how the subtopics are organized
in this topic, as listed at the top of this page.</p>

<h2>Example of a Planned,
Systemic Change Process -- Action Research</h2>

<p>A typical planned, systemic (and systematic) organizational
development process often follows an overall action research approach
(as described below). There are many variations of the action
research approach, including by combining its various phases and/or
splitting some into more phases. This section provides resources
that are organized into one variation of the action research approach.
Note that the more collaborative you are in working with members
of the organization during the following process, the more likely
the success of your overall change effort.</p>

<a name="anchor69054"></a>
<h3>Phase 1: Start-Up -- Clarifying
Expectations and Roles, Assessing Readiness, RFP and Contracts,
Getting Buy-In</h3>

<p>This phase is sometimes called the &quot;Contracting&quot;
and/or &quot;Entry&quot; phase. This phase is usually where the
relationship between you (the initial change agent) and your client
starts, whether you are an external or internal consultant. Experts
assert that this phase is one of the most - if not the most -
important phases in the organizational change process. Activities
during this stage form the foundation for successful organizational
change. The quality of how this phase is carried out usually is
a strong indicator of how the project will go.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Joint Discovery to Identify
Priorities for Change</h3>

<p>The more collaborative the change agent is in working with
members of the client's organization, the more likely that the
change effort will be successful. Your client might not have the
resources to fully participate in all aspects of this discovery
activity -- the more participation they can muster, the better
off your project will be.</p>

<p>Whether you are an external or internal change agent in this
project, you and your client will work together during this phase
to understand more about the overall priority of the change effort
and how you all can effectively address it. It might be a major
problem in the organization or an exciting vision to achieve.
Together, you will collect information, analyze it to identify
findings and conclusions, and then make recommendations from that
information. Sometimes the data-collection effort is very quick,
for example, facilitating a large planning meeting. Other times,
the effort is more extensive, for example, evaluating an entire
organization and developing a complete plan for change. The nature
of discovery also depends on the philosophy of the change agent
and client. For example, subscribers to the philosophy of Appreciative
Inquiry (referenced above) might conduct discovery, not by digging
into the number and causes of problems in the organization, but
by conducting interviews to discover the visions and wishes of
people in the organization.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people minimize the importance of - or altogether
skip - this critical discovery phase, and start change management
by articulating an ambitious and comprehensive vision for change.
Many would argue that it is unethical to initiate a project for
organizational change without fully examining (or discovering)
the current situation in the client's organization. Focusing most
of the change efforts on achieving a robust vision, without at
least some careful discovery, often can be harmful to your client's
organization because your project can end up dealing with symptoms
of any current issues, rather than the root causes. Also, the
project could end up pushing an exciting vision that, while initially
inspiring and motivating to many, could be completely unrealistic
to achieve -- especially if the organization already has many
current, major issues to address. Therefore, when working to guide
change in an organization that already is facing several significant
issues, you are usually better off to start from where your client
is at -- that usually means conducting an effective discovery
to identify priorities for change.</p>

<h4>Preparation -- Establishing a Project Team</h4>

<p>One of the most powerful means to cultivate collaboration is
by working with a project team. Besides, no change agent sees
all aspects of the situation in the organization -- team members
help to see more of those various aspects.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Joint Planning of Organizational
Development Activities to Address Priorities</h3>

<p>In the previous phase about discovery, you and your client
conducted research, discovered various priorities that needed
attention, generated recommendations to address those priorities,
and shared your information with others, for example, in a feedback
meeting. Part of that meeting included discussions - and, hopefully,
decisions - about the overall mutual recommendations that your
client should follow to in order address the priorities that were
identified by you and your client during your discovery. This
phase is focused on further clarifying those recommendations,
along with developing them into various action plans. The various
plans are sometimes integrated into an overall change management
plan. Thus, the early activities in this phase often overlap with,
and are a continuation of, the activities near the end of the
earlier discovery phase. This is true whether you are an external
or internal consultant. Action plans together can now provide
a clear and realistic vision for change. They provide the &quot;roadmap&quot;
for managing the transition from the present state to the desired
future state.</p>

<p>Development of the various action plans is often an enlightening
experience for your client as members of their organization begin
to realize a more systematic approach to their planning and day-to-day
activities. As with other activities during change management,
plans can vary widely in how they are developed. Some plans are
very comprehensive and systematic (often the best form used for
successful change). Others are comprised of diverse sections that
are expected to somehow integrate with each other. Subscribers
to the philosophy of Appreciative Inquiry (referenced above) might
do planning by building on past positive outcomes and on the strengths
of members of the organization.</p>

<h4>Joint Evaluation of Project Activities and Desired Results</h4>

<p>Evaluation occurs both to the quality of implementation of
plans so far during the project and also regarding the extent
of achievement of desired results from the project. Results might
be whether certain indicators of success have been achieved, all
issues have been addressed, a vision of success has been achieved,
action plans have been implemented and/or leaders in the organization
agree the project has been successful.</p>

<h4>If the Project Gets Stuck</h4>

<p>During this phase, if the implementation of the plans gets
stalled for a long time, for example, many months, then you might
cycle back to an earlier phase in the process in order to update
and restart the change management project. Projects can get stuck
for a variety of reasons, e.g., if the overall situation changes
(there suddenly are new and other priorities in the client's organization),
people succumb to burnout, key people leave the organization,
the relationship between the consultant and client changes, or
people refuse to implement action plans.</p>

<h4>Project Termination</h4>

<p>(Many times, this activity is defined as a separate phase in
the project plan.) These activities are very important to address,
even if all participants agree that the project has been successful
and no further activities are needed. Project termination activities
recognize key learnings from the project, acknowledge the client's
development, and identify next steps for you and your client.
They also help to avoid &quot;project creep&quot; where the project
never ends because the requirements for success keep expanding.</p>

<a name="anchor317286"></a>

<h2>Possible Organizational Development Activities (&quot;Interventions&quot;) 
  to Use in Change Management Processes</h2>



<p>The field of Organization Development uses a variety of processes,
approaches, methods, techniques, applications, etc., (these are
often termed &quot;interventions&quot;) to address organizational
issues and goals in order to increase performance. The following
partial list of interventions is organized generally in the order
presented by Cummings and Worley in their &quot;Organization Development
and Change&quot; (West Publishing, 1993). The following types
of interventions are often highly integrated with each other during
a project for change.</p>

<a name="anchor71548"></a>
<h3>How People Choose Organizational
Development Activities</h3>

<p>There are no standard activities that always successfully address
certain types of issues in organizations. Many times, the success
of a project lies not with having selected the perfect choice
of activities, but rather with how honest and participative people
were during the project, how much they learned and how open they
were to changing their plans for change.</p>

<p>However, there are some basic considerations that most people
make when selecting from among the many choices for organizational
development, or capacity building, activities. Considerations
include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, does the change-management method (if one was used)
  suggest what organizational development activities to use now,
  for example, the method of strategic management might suggest
  that a SWOT analysis be done, strategic goals be established
  along with action plans for each goal, and then implementation
  of the action plans be closely monitored.</li>
  <li>Is the activity most likely to address the findings from
  the discovery, that is, to solve the problems or achieve the
  goals? To find out, review any research about use of the activity,
  discuss the potential outcomes with experts and also with members
  of the organization. Consider posing your questions in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/generalresources/free-online-groups.htm"
  class="textlink">online groups</a> of experts about change.</li>
  <li>Does the nature of the activity match the culture of the
  organization? The best way to find out is to discuss the activity
  with members of the organization.</li>
  <li>Does the change agent and key members of the organization
  have the ability to conduct the activity? For example, technostructural
  and strategic interventions sometimes require technical skills
  that are not common to many people.</li>
  <li>Does the activity require more time to conduct than the time
  available in which to address the problem or goal? For example,
  a cash crisis requires immediate attention, so while a comprehensive
  strategic planning process might ultimately be useful, the four
  to five months to do that planning is impractical.</li>
  <li>Does the client's organization have the resources that are
  necessary to conduct the activity, considering resources such
  as funding, attention and time from people and facilities.</li>
</ol>

target="_blank">Management for You: Interventions for Change</a></p>

<p>Before you and your client select types of interventions for
the project, be aware of your strong biases about how you view
organizations. Without recognizing those biases, you might favor
certain types of interventions primarily because those are the
only ones you can readily see and understand, even if other types
of interventions might be much more effective in your project.

<h3>Human Process Interventions (Group
and Individual Human Relations)</h3>

<p>With today's strong emphasis on humanistic values, the following
interventions are getting a great deal of attention and emphasis
during efforts for change. They focus on helping members of the
organization to enhance themselves, each other and the ways in
which they work together in order to enhance their overall organization.
Although the types of interventions selected for a project depend
on a variety of considerations and the interventions in a project
often are highly integrated with each other, the following human
process interventions might be particularly helpful during change
projects in organizations where there is some combination of the
following: many new employees, different cultures working together,
many complaints among organizational members, many conflicts,
low morale, high turnover, ineffective teams, etc.</p>

<h3>Technostructural Interventions (Structures,
Technologies, Positions, etc.)</h3>

<p>The following are examples of activities that focus on improving
the performance of organizations primarily by modifying structures,
technologies, operations, procedures and roles/positions in the
organization. Although the types of interventions selected for
a project depend on a variety of considerations and the interventions
in a project often are highly integrated with each other, the
following technostructural interventions might be particularly
helpful in the following kinds of situations<b>:</b> rapid growth
but few internal systems to sustain that growth, much confusion
about roles, a new major technology or process has been introduced,
many complaints from customers, etc. These interventions might
also be useful in new organizations where internal operational
systems must be developed and implemented.</p>

<h3>Human Resource Management Interventions
(Individual and Group Performance Management)</h3>

<p>The following activities aim to enhance overall organizational
performance by improving the performance of individuals and groups
within the organization. Performance is in regard to setting goals,

activities to achieve goals and dissuading those that don't. Performance
also is in regard to developing employees, including by enhancing
their overall sense of well-being. Although the types of interventions
selected for a project depend on a variety of considerations and
the interventions in a project often are highly integrated, the
following human resource interventions might be particularly helpful
in the following kinds of situations<b>:</b> new organizational
goals have been established, a major new system or technology
must be implemented in a timely fashion, many new employees, plans
don't seem to get implemented, productivity is low, ineffective
teams, etc.</p>
