<p>When a topic (for example, organizational change and development)
becomes very prominent, it often takes on many different interpretations
and meanings. The advantage is that topic becomes very accessible,
interesting and enlightening to many. The disadvantage is that
it's also increasingly vague and difficult for many to make practical.
To make this topic of organizational change and development useful,
we should reference some common definitions. </p>

<p>Even if not all people agree with the definitions, we at least
have some definitions in common to disagree about -- that alone
can enhance the communications about the topic. Having some understanding
and discernment about the following phrases will help readers
to benefit even more from literature about organizational change.</p>

<h3>Organizational performance management </h3>

<p>We're used to thinking of ongoing performance management for
employees, for example, setting goals, monitoring the employee's
achievement of those goals, sharing feedback with the employee,
evaluating the employee's performance, rewarding performance or
firing the employee. Performance management applies to organizations,
too, and includes recurring activities to establish organizational
goals, monitor progress toward the goals, and make adjustments
to achieve those goals more effectively and efficiently.</p>

<p>Note that, in contrast to organizational change projects, organizational
performance management activities are recurring in nature. Those
recurring activities are much of what leaders and managers inherently
do in their organizations -- some do them far better than others.
An organizational change project is not likely to be successful
if it is not within the context of the recurring activities of
organizational performance management.</p>

<h3>Organizational change</h3>

<p>This phrase refers to the overall nature of activities, for
example, their extent and rate, that occurs during a project that
aims to enhance the overall performance of the organization. The
activities are often led by a change agent, or person currently
responsible to guide the overall change effort. The activities
are often project-oriented (a one-time project) and geared to
address a current overall problem or goal in the organization.
(A relatively new phrase, capacity building, refers to these types
of activities, as well.)</p>

<h3>Organizational development </h3>

<p>This phrase refers to the evolution of the organization during
the overall organizational change activities, for example, evolution
of its members to be able to resolve a major problem, achieve
an overall project goal and/or achieve overall organizational
goals. Organizational development is an outcome of organizational
change activities.</p>

<h3>Change management </h3>

<p>This phrase refers to the implementation of a certain approach
or methodology to ensure the organizational change effort is successful,
including to ensure a clear vision and/or goals for the project,
and to modify systems in the organization to more effectively
achieve the goals. Change management activities can range from
a planned, structured and explicit approach (successful change
efforts usually are) to unplanned and implicit.</p>

<h3>Change agent </h3>

<p>A change agent is the person who's currently responsible for
the overall change effort. The role can be performed by different
people at different times. For example, an effective consultant
(internal or external) might first perform the role, but work
in such a way during the project that the role ultimately is adopted
by someone else inside the organization.</p>

<h3>Organization Development (OD) </h3>

<p>OD is a field of research, theory and practice dedicated to
expanding the knowledge and effectiveness of people to accomplish
more successful organizational change and performance. Different
people often have different perspectives on the field, depending
on their particular values and skills. Many people assert that,
for OD projects to be highly effective, they must be systems-based
in design and highly humanistic in implementation. (Occasionally,
someone refers to the field as &quot;organizational development,&quot;
but for the sake of clarity in this topic, that definition will
not be used in the Free Management Library.)</p>
