<h2>Overview of Large-Scale Interventions</h2>
<p>Robert Rhouda, of the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis, Minnesota, provides 
  a specific, itemized definition of large-scale interventions for organizational 
  change, in his paper, <a class="textlink" href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/background.html"
target="_blank">Background and Theory for Large Scale Organizational Change</a>. 
  According to Rhouda, &quot;The major features of large-scale, real-time change 
  management process include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the theory-base uses less action research and discrepancy theory, and focuses 
    on application of systems theory</li>
  <li>the data base source is no longer internal to the organization, but now 
    involves both the organization and its environment (an open-systems approach)</li>
  <li>the data base, which formerly had limited availability, is now widely shared 
    throughout the organization</li>
  <li>time: what was formerly a slow &quot;waterfall&quot; process is now a fast, 
    quick response which results in immediate action taking place</li>
  <li>learning moves from the individual or unit to the whole organization</li>
  <li>the responsibility and accountability moves from senior management to a 
    mixture of senior management plus the whole system</li>
  <li>the consultant role, formerly reserved for data collection and feedback, 
    now also includes structures and facilities for data analysis and action planning</li>
  <li>the change process moves from incremental change to fundamental, organization-wide 
    change&quot;</li>
</ol>
