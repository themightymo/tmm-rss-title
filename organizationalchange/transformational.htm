<h1>Organizational Transformation</h1>
<p>Organizational transformation is a type of organizational change that involves 
  a radical, fundamental change, rather than an incremental change. An example 
  of transformational change might be changing an organization’s structure and 
  culture from the traditional top-down, hierarchical structure to a large amount 
  of self-directing teams. </p>
<p>Another example might be Business Process Re-engineering, which tries to take 
  apart (at least on paper, at first) the major parts and processes of the organization 
  and then put them back together in a more optimal fashion. Transformational 
  change is sometimes referred to as quantum change. </p>
<p>Examples of incremental change might include continuous improvement as a quality 
  management process or implementation of new computer system to increase efficiencies. 
  Many times, organizations experience incremental change and its leaders do not 
  recognize the change as such. </p>
