<p>It seems like the topic of organizational change has reached
evangelical proportions. There's an explosion of literature about
the subject and an accompanying explosion in the number of consultants
who offer services in this general area. The following information
attempts to provide some basic perspective about the concept of
organizational change. (See the  and  listed at the end of this article.)</p>

<h2>What's &quot;Organizational
Change?&quot;</h2>


Typically, the concept of organizational change is in regard to
organization-wide change, as opposed to smaller changes such as
adding a new person, modifying a program, etc. Examples of organization-wide
change might include a change in mission, restructuring operations
(e.g., restructuring to self-managed teams, layoffs, etc.), new
technologies, mergers, major collaborations, &quot;rightsizing&quot;,
new programs such as Total Quality Management, re-engineering,
etc. Some experts refer to organizational transformation. Often
this term designates a fundamental and radical reorientation in
the way the organization operates.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor494256"></a>
<h2>What Provokes
&quot;Organizational Change&quot;?</h2>


Change should not be done for the sake of change -- it's a strategy
to accomplish some overall goal. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/index.htm">Organizational
Performance Management</a>.) Usually organizational change is
provoked by some major outside driving force, e.g., substantial
cuts in funding, address major new markets/clients, need for dramatic
increases in productivity/services, etc. Typically, organizations
must undertake organization-wide change to evolve to a different
level in their life cycle, e.g., going from a highly reactive,
entrepreneurial organization to more stable and planned development.
Transition to a new chief executive can provoke organization-wide
change when his or her new and unique personality pervades the
entire organization.</p>

<p>

<h2>Why is Organization-Wide
Change Difficult to Accomplish?</h2>


Typically there are strong resistances to change. People are afraid
of the unknown. Many people think things are already just fine
and don't understand the need for change. Many are inherently
cynical about change, particularly from reading about the notion
of &quot;change&quot; as if it's a mantra. Many doubt there are
effective means to accomplish major organizational change. Often
there are conflicting goals in the organization, e.g., to increase
resources to accomplish the change yet concurrently cut costs
to remain viable. Organization-wide change often goes against
the very values held dear by members in the organization, that
is, the change may go against how members believe things should
be done. That's why much of organizational-change literature discusses
needed changes in the culture of the organization, including changes
in members' values and beliefs and in the way they enact these
values and beliefs.</p>

<p>

<h2>How Is Organization-Wide
Change Best Carried Out?</h2>

Successful change must involve top management, including
the board and chief executive. Usually there's a champion who
initially instigates the change by being visionary, persuasive
and consistent. A change agent role is usually responsible to
translate the vision to a realistic plan and carry out the plan.
Change is usually best carried out as a team-wide effort. Communications
about the change should be frequent and with all organization
members. To sustain change, the structures of the organization
itself should be modified, including strategic plans, policies
and procedures. This change in the structures of the organization
typically involves an unfreezing, change and re-freezing process.</p>

<p>The best approaches to address resistances is through increased
and sustained communications and education. For example, the leader
should meet with all managers and staff to explain reasons for
the change, how it generally will be carried out and where others
can go for additional information. A plan should be developed
and communicated. Plans do change. That's fine, but communicate
that the plan has changed and why. Forums should be held for organization
members to express their ideas for the plan. They should be able
to express their concerns and frustrations as well.</p>

<h2>Some General
Guidelines to Organization-Wide Change</h2>

(Note that the library topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/index.htm">Basic
Overview of Major Methods and Movements to Improve Organizational
Performance</a> includes overviews of major methods and movements
associated with organizational change. Readers would best be served
to read the following basic guidelines as foundation for carrying
out any of the methods associated with organizational change.)</p>

<p>In addition to the general guidelines listed above, there are
a few other basic guidelines to keep in mind. <br />
1. Consider using a consultant. Ensure the consultant is highly
experienced in organization-wide change. Ask to see references
and check the references. <br />
2. Widely communicate the potential need for change. Communicate
what you're doing about it. Communicate what was done and how
it worked out. <br />
3. Get as much feedback as practical from employees, including
what they think are the problems and what should be done to resolve
them. If possible, work with a team of employees to manage the
change.<br />
4. Don't get wrapped up in doing change for the sake of change.
Know why you're making the change. What goal(s) do you hope to
accomplish?<br />
6. Plan the change. How do you plan to reach the goals, what will
you need to reach the goals, how long might it take and how will
you know when you've reached your goals or not? Focus on the coordination
of the departments/programs in your organization, not on each
part by itself. Have someone in charge of the plan.<br />
7. End up having every employee ultimately reporting to one person,
if possible, and they should know who that person is. Job descriptions
are often complained about, but they are useful in specifying
who reports to whom.<br />
8. Delegate decisions to employees as much as possible. This includes
granting them the authority and responsibility to get the job
done. As much as possible, let them decide how to do the project.<br />
9. The process won't be an &quot;aha!&quot; It will take longer
than you think. <br />
10. Keep perspective. Keep focused on meeting the needs of your
customer or clients. <br />
11. Take care of yourself first. Organization-wide change can
be highly stressful. <br />
12. Don't seek to control change, but rather to expect it, understand
it and manage it. <br />
13. Include closure in the plan. Acknowledge and celebrate your
accomplishments.<br />
14. Read some resources about organizational change, including
new forms and structures.</p>
