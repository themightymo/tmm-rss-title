</p><h2>Role of New Manager or
Supervisor is Often Very Stressful</h2>
<p>

The experience of a first-time
supervisor or manager is often one of the most trying in their
career. They rarely have adequate training for the new management
role -- they were promoted because of their technical expertise,
not because of their managerial expertise. They suddenly have
a wide range of policies and other regulations to apply to their
subordinates. Work is never &quot;done&quot;. They must represent
upper management to their subordinates, and their subordinates
to upper management. They're stuck in the middle. They can feel
very alone.
</p>

<h2><a name="guide" id="guide"></a>Guidelines to Manage Yourself</h2>
<p>

Everyone in management has
gone through the transition from individual contributor to manager.
Each person finds their own way to &quot;survive&quot;. The following
guidelines will help you keep your perspective and your health.
</p>

<h3>Monitor your work hours</h3>
The first visible, undeniable sign that things are out of
hand is that you're working too many hours. Note how many hours
you are working per week. Set a limit and stick to that limit.
Ask your peers or boss for help.

<h3>Recognize your own signs of stress</h3>
Different people show their stress in different ways. Some
people have &quot;blow ups&quot;. Some people get very forgetful.
Some people lose concentration. For many people, they excel at
their jobs, but their home life falls apart. Know your signs of
stress. Tell someone else what they are. Ask them to check in
with you every two weeks to see how you are doing. Every two weeks,
write down how you are doing -- if only for a minute. Stick in
it a file marked &quot;%*#)%&amp;!!#$&quot;.

<h3>Get a mentor or a coach</h3>
Ideally, your supervisors is a very good mentor and coach.
Many people have &quot;been there, done that&quot; and can serve
as great mentors to you.

<h3>Learn to delegate</h3>
Delegating is giving others the responsibility and authority
to carry out tasks. You maintain the accountability to get them
done, but you let others decide how they will carry out the tasks
themselves. Delegation is a skill to learn. Start learning it.

<h3>Communicate as much as you can</h3>
Have at least one person in your life with whom you are completely
honest. Hold regular meetings with staff -- all of them in one
meeting at least once a month, and meet at least once every two
weeks with each of your direct reports. A common problem among
new managers and supervisors (or among experienced, but ineffective
ones) is not meeting unless there's something to say. There is
always something to communicate, even if to say that things are
going well and then share the health of your pets. New managers
and supervisors often assume that their employees know as much
as they do. One of the first signs of an organization in trouble
is that communications break down. Err on the side of too much
communication, rather than not enough.

<h3>Recognize what's important from
what's urgent</h3>
Fix the system, not the problem.
One of the major points that experienced manages make is that
they've learned to respond to what's important, rather than what's
urgent. Phone calls, sick employees, lost paperwork, disagreements
between employees all seem to suddenly crop up and demand immediate
attention. It can seem like your day is responding to one crises
after another. As you gain experience, you quit responding to
the crisis and instead respond to the problem that causes the
crises. You get an answering machine or someone else to answer
the phone. You plan for employees being gone for the day -- and
you accept that people get sick. You develop a filing system to
keep track of your paperwork. You learn basic skills in conflict
management. Most important, you recognize that management is a
process -- you never really &quot;finish&quot; your to-do list
-- your list is there to help you keep track of details. Over
time, you learn to relax.

<h3>Recognize accomplishments</h3>
<p>Our society promotes problem solvers. We solve one problem and quickly move 
  on to the next. The culture of many organizations rewards problem solvers. Once 
  a problem is solved, we quickly move on to the next to solve that one, too. 
  Pretty soon we feel empty. We feel as if we're not making a difference. Our 
  subordinates do, too. So in all your plans, include time to acknowledge accomplishments 
  -- if only by having a good laugh by the coffee machine, do take time to note 
  that something useful was done. </p>
