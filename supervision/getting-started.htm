<h2>Rarely Have Adequate Training</h2>

<p>Often, employees are promoted to supervision because of their
strong technical expertise -- expertise in building a product
or providing a service. Suddenly, the new supervisor is now charged
with a whole new range of responsibilities, many of which have
little to do with technical expertise.</p>

<p>Managers often deal with great deal of paperwork and people.
Although paperwork is usually the most tedious, it's often the
most predictable. People aren't predictable. They have moods,
illnesses, career expectations, crises in their family lives,
etc. The supervisor's technical expertise is often useless when
it comes to supervising people.</p>

<p><a name="anchor345153"></a></p>

<h2>Sometimes Intimidated by Wide Range of Policies and Procedures</h2>

<p>The new supervisor is suddenly faced with a wide range of rules
and regulations -- each of which the supervisor is responsible
to enforce. The supervisor is responsible for signing time cards,
authorizing overtime, granting compensation time, dealing with
performance problems, developing job descriptions, following hiring
procedures, dealing with grievances, conforming to a complicated
pay system, and the list goes on. It can be quite difficult to
conform to today's wide range of employee laws, rules and regulations
-- and at the same time, produce a product or service.</p>

<p><a name="anchor346221"></a></p>

<h2>New Supervisors Rarely Have Enough Time</h2>

<p>No matter how many courses or degrees a new supervisor has
completed, they're often surprised that management activities
are so hectic and demanding. No matter how thorough the planning,
managers rarely get to spend much time on any one activity. The
role of most managers, whether new supervisors or executives,
is interspersed with frequent interruptions. Any surprise in the
work or lives of employees is a sudden demand on supervisors.</p>

<p>New supervisors often expect to have complete knowledge of
everything that goes on in their group. They don't want to encounter
any surprises. So they spend more time reading, thinking, planning,
communicating with employees -- new supervisors often spend 60
hours a week on the job. Still, they don't feel they have enough
time to do the job right.</p>

<p><a name="anchor356454"></a></p>

<h2>New Supervisors Often Feel Very Alone</h2>

<p>Each manager has a unique role in the organization. Each organization
is unique. Usually there are no clear procedures for dealing with
the numerous challenges that suddenly face management. Ultimately,
it's up to each manager to get through the day. Faced with a great
deal of pressure, little time and continuing demands from other
people, the new supervisor can feel quite alone.</p>

<p>The supervisor is responsible to be an advocate for the organization
and an advocate for the employee. For example, if the organization
implements an unpopular new policy, the supervisor is often responsible
to communicate and justify that new policy to the employee. In
this case, management expects the supervisor to present and support
the new policy, and the employee vents his or her frustration
to the supervisor. However, if the supervisor wants to promote
the employee or present some other reward, he or she is now representing
the employee's case to the rest of management. The supervisor
is often alone, stuck in the middle.</p>

<p>The new supervisor wants to come across as having deserved
their promotion, as being in control of the situation. It's difficult
to seek help from others in the organization. Even when there
is someone there to talk to, it's difficult to fully explain the
situation -- the new supervisor sometimes doesn't know how things
got so hectic and confusing.</p>

<h2>New Supervisors Often Feel Overwhelmed, Stressed Out</h2>

<p>The new supervisor is responsible, often for the first time,
for the activities of another employee. The supervisor must ensure
the employee knows his or her job, has the resources to do the
job and does the job as effectively as possible.</p>

<p>Until a new supervisor develops a &quot;feeling for the territory&quot;,
they often deal with the stresses of supervision by working harder,
rather than smarter. They miss the comfort and predictability
of their previous job.</p>

<p>The stress and loneliness in the role of new supervisor can
bring out the worst in a person. If they deal with stress by retreating,
they'll retreat to their offices and close the door. If they deal
with frustration, they'll become angry and unreasonable with their
employees. If they are used to getting strong praise and high
grades, they'll work harder and harder until their jobs become
their lives.</p>

<h2>Support and Development Are Critical for New Supervisors</h2>

<p>Courses in supervision, delegation, time management, stress
management, etc., are not enough. New supervisors need ongoing
coaching and support. They need someone whom they can confide
in. Ideally, they have a mentor in the organization who remembers
what it's like to be a first-time supervisor, someone who makes
themselves available.</p>

<p>If the experience of first-time supervision is successful --
it's challenging, but fulfilling -- the supervisor goes on to
become a progressive, supportive manager.</p>
