<h2><a name="sugg" id="sugg"></a>Suggested Previous Reading About Supervision</h2>
<p>Supervision is the activity carried out by supervisors to oversee the productivity 
  and progress of employees who report directly to the supervisors. For example, 
  chief executive officers supervise those who report directly to the chief executives, 
  middle-managers supervise first-level supervisors, and first-level supervisors 
  supervise entry-level employees. Supervision is a management activity and supervisors 
  typically are considered to have a management role in the organization.</p>
<p>It will be tremendously helpful to the reader is he or she first has some basic 
  understanding of the larger context within which supervision occurs. Supervision 
  is a management role. </p>
