Development</a>.)</p>

<p>Among the various positions in management, the role of supervisor
is quite unique. As described in the <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/index.htm">Basic Overview of Supervision</a>, new supervisors are
often under a great deal of stress. It may be rather straightforward
to identify a list of core competencies for the role of supervisor.
However, it can be a major challenge to help the new supervisor
develop the necessary skills while at the same managing stress
and time sufficient to keep perspective (and sanity). Therefore,
consider the following guidelines when carrying out a supervisoral
development plan.</p>

<h2>Have a Human Resources Representative Play Major Role</h2>
A trained human resources professional can be a major benefit
in the development of a new supervisor. The representative often
has strong working knowledge of the various policies and procedures
that, at first, can seem quite intimidating to the supervisor.
The representative usually has a good understanding of the dynamics
of training and development. In addition, the representative can
an be an impartial confidant for the supervisor.</p>

<h2>Establish a Development Plan</h2>
One of the biggest contributions from a development plan is perspective.
In the middle of the stress and confusion, the new supervisor
can reference the plan to retain some basic perspective on their
job. The plan coordinates ongoing interaction between the new
supervisor and their supervisor, ensuring each is aware of the
direction and accomplishments of the new supervisor.</p>

<h2>Key Skills: Delegation, Time Management and Stress Management</h2>
Ensure the plan includes strong, initial focus on developing
these three key skills. Effective skills in delegation can relieve
a great deal of stress from the supervisor, while ensuring high
productivity among employees. Strong skills in time management
can ensure that the supervisor is using time in the best way possible.
Finally, basic skills in stress management can ensure that the
new supervisor maintains poise and perspective.</p>

<h2>Provide Ongoing Guidance and Support</h2>
An experienced supervisor can soon forget how confusing and
challenging the role of new supervisor can be. Even if things
seem to be going fine, be sure to stop in and visit the new supervisor
on a regular basis. Some new supervisors may not feel comfortable
asking for help. Provide ongoing affirmation and support.</p>

<h2>Track the New Supervisor's Time on the Job</h2>
Notice how many hours the new supervisor is spending at work.
If that amount has increased substantially since he or she began
the new role, then intervene. Various studies have shown that
productivity levels off substantially after 50-60 hours of work
in a week. Consider establishing a maximum amount of hours for
the new supervisor, e.g., 50 hours a week. If, with this limit,
a great deal of work is not getting done by the new supervisor,
then look for the cause. Perhaps the new supervisor does not have
sufficient resources or training to carry out the job. Perhaps
there's just too much work to do.</p>

<h2>Tactfully Interact with Supervisor's Staff</h2>
Ongoing stresses can sometimes bring out the worst in a new supervisor.
He or she may struggle to effectively delegate projects, maintain
composure with employees or even be available for employees to
voice concerns. Ongoing complaints from employees are a key indicator
that the new supervisor may be struggling. Therefore, take time
to interact with the new supervisor's employees, but do so tactfully.
However, be careful to conclude if there are really any problems.
Each supervisor carries out their jobs according to their own
unique needs and nature. Don't compare the style of the new supervisor
to your own. He or she may not conduct the role in the same way
that others would.</p>
