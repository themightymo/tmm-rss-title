<h2>Using
the Following Lists</h2>
<h3>Some Disagreement About Competencies Need by Supervisors</h3>
Most people will agree on what key knowledge, skills and
abilities are required to drive a car -- this is not the case
with supervisor training. Introductory courses, workshops and
seminars on supervision can include a wide range of topics and
depend very much on what the designer of the training program
believes supervisors should know. These beliefs can vary widely,
particularly because: a) trainers have varying opinions about
roles of supervisors; and b) the nature of today's workplace is
changing to include more, eg, self-managed teams, emphasis on
leadership, diversity management, performance management, etc.

<h3>Some Misunderstandings About Competencies Needed
by Supervisors</h3>
There are often misunderstandings about the role of supervisors,
for example, people mistakenly believe that supervision occurs
only with entry-level workers. This belief is incorrect. Chief
Executive Officers are supervisors of Chief Financial Officers,
and middle-line managers are supervisors of first-line managers,
etc.

<p>Also, trainers can forget that supervisors are seldom only
responsible for supervision. Too often, supervision is carried
out &quot;in the background&quot;, secondary to getting a product
or service out the door. Consequently, supervisory training programs
sometimes neglect to include key skills, such as handling burnout,
stress management, time management, etc.</p>

<h3>Don't Get Hung Up On Categories -- Different People Will
Categorize Topics Differently</h3>
If the reader had the opportunity to review a wide variety
of supervisoral development programs, he or she would notice a
wide variety of approaches to categorizing topics. Don't get hung
up on the &quot;right&quot; way to categorize the  following
topics.
