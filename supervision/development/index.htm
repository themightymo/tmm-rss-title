<p>Simply put, supervisory development is an effort (hopefully,
planned in nature) that enhances the learner's capacity to be
a supervisor. Supervision often includes conducting basic management
skills (decision making, problem solving, planning, delegation
and meeting management), organizing teams, noticing the need for
and designing new job roles in the group, hiring new employees,
training new employees, employee performance management (setting
goals, observing and giving feedback, addressing performance issues,
firing employees, etc.) and ensuring conformance to personnel
policies and other internal regulations. A critical skill for
anyone is the ability to manage their own learning. The highly
motivated, self-directed reader can gain a great deal of learning
and results from following the suggestions and using the materials
in this section.</p>

<h3>Before Supervisory Development, Get Impression of What &quot;Supervision&quot;
Is</h3>

<p>The first place to start learning about supervision is to get
some sense of what supervision is -- in particular, understand
get an impression of the areas of knowledge and skills recommended
for effective supervision in organizations. Review information
in: <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/index.htm">Basic
Overview of Supervision</a><br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/supervision/development/index.htm">Skills
and Practices in Organizational Supervision</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor273990"></a></p>

<h3>What Does Supervisory Development Look Like?</h3>

<p>If you read the information in the section <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm#anchor918135"
class="textlink">Training Basics -- Understanding Learning and Development</a> 
  listed above, you learned about training programs that are informal and formal, 
  and other-directed or self-directed. Supervisory development programs come in 
  all of these combinations, as well. You can learn about supervision in informal 
  &quot;programs&quot;, for example, by reading some articles, discussing supervision 
  with a friend, etc. You can attend formal training, for example, a course, seminar 
  or workshop. At this point, it might help you to get some perspective on the 
  nature of supervision development programs by looking at some. See<br />

<h3>Strong Value of Self-Directed Learning</h3>

<p>The ability to manage one's own learning is an increasingly
critical skill. Bouchard explains, &#147;Over the years, it has
become increasingly clear that traditional approaches to [training!]
program design and delivery in the workplace and in associative
organizations present some important weaknesses. Problem areas
include: coping with the short life span of useful knowledge;
passing down acquired competencies to succeeding cohorts; accommodating
the demands of productivity while providing for a continuity of
learning; [and!] enabling learners to pursue activities that correspond
to their learning styles and needs&#148; (in <i>Self-Directed
Learning in Organizational Settings</i> (working paper), Concordia
University, Montreal, Canada, p. 1).</p>

<p>This topic in the library provides an excellent opportunity
to begin managing your learning. To learn more about self-directed
learning, see<br />

<h2>Informal Activities to Learn About Supervision</h2>

<p><a name="anchor283521"></a></p>

<p><a name="anchor283764"></a></p>

<h3>Attempt to Go Beyond Reading Books ...</h3>

<p>There are a wide range of everyday and on-the-job activities
from which you can learn about supervision and even enhance your
supervision skills. Informal methods can include, for example,
reading books, having discussions with friends, on-the-job training,
keeping a diary with thoughts about supervision , etc. One of
the more insidious ways to avoid learning to supervise is by reading
lots of books about supervision, rather than actually implementing
any of the advice offered in any of them. You're not likely to
develop much for supervision skills merely by reading, talking
or attending a course unless you actually apply new materials
and methods, and continue to reflect on what you're learning along
the way.</p>

<p><a name="anchor290632"></a></p>

<h3>Ideas for Activities to Learn About Supervision</h3>

<p>One of the most effective and reliable ways to learn is to
do so consciously, in a planned fashion. Therefore, be sure to
consider customizing your own supervisory training plan. Complete
guidelines are provided in the next section, <a href="#anchor303528"

Development Plan</a> (hereafter called the &quot;Guidelines&quot;).
That document includes guidelines for you to identify your overall
training goals and the learning objectives and activities to achieve
the goals. Guidelines are also provided for carrying out the learning
activities and evaluating your entire learning experience.</p>

better off to work towards at most two to four goals at a time.
There are a variety of ways to identify your training goals, depending
on what you want to be able to accomplish as a result of implementing
your training plan.</p>

<h3>Begin Identifying Your Training Goals</h3>
<h4>Consider Performance Gaps, Growth Gaps or Opportunities Gaps</h4>
<p>Performance gaps are areas of knowledge and skills need to improve performance 
  and are usually indicated during performance reviews with your supervisor. Growth 
  gaps are areas of knowledge and skills need to reach a career goal. Opportunity 
  gaps are areas of knowledge and skills needed to take advantage of an upcoming 
  opportunity.</p>
<h4>Conduct Self-Assessments</h4>
<p>The following online, self-assessments may help, as well, by helping you assess 
  certain areas of your own supervisory abilities.<br />

<h3>Determining Your Learning Objectives and Activities</h3>

<h4>Purpose of this Section</h4>

<p>The purpose of this section is to identify the various learning
objectives you should achieve and learning activities you should
undertake in order to achieve the overall training goals in your
plan.</p>

<h4>Identifying Your Learning Objectives</h4>

<p>Carefully consider each of your training goals. What specifically
must be accomplished (that is, what objectives must be reached)
in order for you to reach those goals? Which of these objectives
require learning new areas of knowledge or skills? These objectives
are likely to become learning objectives in your training plan.
To get a stronger sense for learning objectives, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/training/systematic/designing-training.htm"
class="textlink">Basic Guidelines and Examples for Writing Learning
Objectives</a>.</p>

<h4>Identifying Your Learning Activities</h4>

<p>Learning activities are the activities you will conduct in
order to reach the learning objectives. The activities should
help you work toward your training goal, accommodate your particular
learning styles, be accessible to you and be enjoyable as well.
