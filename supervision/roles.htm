<h2 align="center">ROLES OF SUPERVISORS</h2>
<p>
<a name="anchor234081"></a>
<h2>Coach</h2>

A good supervisor places a high priority on coaching
employees. Good coaching involves working with employees to establish
suitable goals, action plans and time lines. The supervisor delegates
and also provides ongoing guidance and support to the employee
as they complete their action plans. Rarely can job goals be established
without considering other aspects of an employee's life, e.g.,
time available for training, career preferences, personal strengths
and weaknesses, etc. A supervisor is sometimes confronted with
walking a fine line between being a supervisor and the employee's
confidant.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor234351"></a>
<h2>Mentor</h2>

Usually the supervisor understands the organization
and the employee's profession better than the employee. Consequently,
the supervisor is in a unique position to give ongoing advice
to the employee about job and career. The employee can look to
the supervisor as a model for direction and development. An effective
mentor-mentee relationship requires the supervisor to accept the
responsibility of mentorship. A good supervisor can be a priceless
addition to the career of an employee.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor234654"></a>
<h2>Advocate for
Organization</h2>

Often, the supervisor is the first person to tell employees
about new policies and programs from management. It's not uncommon
that employees are confused or frustrated by these new actions,
and need further clarification and support from supervisors. In
the rapidly changing world of today's organizations, it can be
a major challenge to present new programs to employees without
their being frustrated or even cynical. The supervisor must be
authentic, yet tactful.</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor234908"></a>
<h2>Advocate for
Employee</h2>

The supervisor is often responsible to represent the
employee's requests and to management, along with also representing
the employee's case for deserving a reward. For example, if an
employee deserves a promotion, the supervisor often must justify
the case for promotion to the supervisor's supervisor, as well.
If the employee has a rather unique personal situation that warrants
special consideration by the rest of management, the supervisor
must explain this situation and how it can be handled. It's not
unusual for employees to sometimes see the supervisor as part
of &quot;management&quot; while at other times seeing the supervisor
as a personal friend.</p>

<h2 align="center">RESPONSIBILITIES OF SUPERVISORS</h2>
<p> <a name="anchor188428" id="anchor188428"></a> </p>
<h2>Before Reviewing Responsibilities, There Are Two Considerations</h2>
<h3>Often, Supervisors Hold Two Jobs</h3>
Note that in some types of organizations, e.g., a matrix organization, the supervisor 
attends solely to the responsibilities of the supervisoral role. However, in many 
organizations, the supervisor is responsible not only for supervisoral responsibilities, 
but also for product-line responsibilities, that is, to get a product or service 
out the door. Products and services generate revenue. Consequently, the role of 
supervision sometimes takes a &quot;background&quot; role to the product-line 
role.
<p></p>
<h3>Support of Human Resources Department</h3>
Note that if the organization is large enough, the supervisor is fortunate to 
have a staff department, e.g., Human Resources (HR) Department, that directs or 
supports many of the activities carried out by supervisors. The supervisor still 
carries out the supervisory responsibilities, but HR is a tremendous help. For 
example, HR guides and supports activities in staffing, development and management 
of personnel policies and records, training and development, performance appraisals 
and performance problems, career counseling, organization development, etc. HR 
provides this help and ensures that all activities conform to current rules and 
regulations.
<p></p>
<p> <a name="anchor189245" id="anchor189245"></a> </p>
<h2>Personnel Policies and Procedures</h2>
The supervisor is usually responsible to ensure that employees follow the organization's 
policies and procedures, e.g., for sick time, personal leave, overtime, contact 
with the media or press, confidentiality about organization information, etc. 
Concurrently, the supervisor must follow policies and procedures for carrying 
out supervisory responsibilities, e.g., policies and procedures for hiring, firing, 
promotions, etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/personnelpolicies/index.htm">Personnel 
Policies, Handbooks and Records</a>.)
<p></p>
<p> <a name="anchor189483" id="anchor189483"></a> </p>
<h2>Staffing</h2>
Supervisors regularly review the needs of their employees. Consequently, they're 
often the first to notice the need for a new position in the organization. In 
this case, the supervisor opens a new role by getting authorization from upper 
management. This often requires communication and justification for funds to fill 
the new position. The supervisor reviews advertisements for job candidates, reviews 
resumes and conducts interviews. The supervisor recommends who should be hired 
from among job candidates and ensures a job offer is made to the most suitable 
candidate. There's usually a great deal of paperwork, e.g., a job application, 
starting a personnel file, providing an employee manual, salary and tax forms, 
etc. Finally, the supervisor must ensure the new employee has adequate facilities, 
e.g., desk, computer,office supplies, etc. (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/index.htm">Staffing</a>.)
<p></p>
<p> <a name="anchor189829" id="anchor189829"></a> </p>
<h2>Employee Training and Development</h2>
Supervisors ensure new employees are oriented to the organization, its policies, 
facilities, etc. They develop training plans with employees to ensure employees 
have the necessary expertise to carry out their jobs. They provide ongoing guidance 
to employees, often in the forms of ongoing coaching and counseling. Supervisors 
often provide career counseling, as well, to help employees develop and advance 
in their careers. (Note that there's a trend that employees are being help responsible 
for their own career planning, while supervisors provide career counseling to 
help the employee in their effort.) (See <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/training/methods/formal-and-informal-methods.htm">Training 
Basics for Supervisors and Learners</a>.)
<p></p>
<p> <a name="anchor190257" id="anchor190257"></a> </p>
<h2>Employee Performance Management</h2>
Supervisors ensure that job descriptions accurately record the primary responsibilities, 
qualifications and terms for each job role in their group. They set performance 
standards for tasks, jobs and roles of their employees. They ensure employees 
have appropriate and realistic job goals. They provide ongoing feedback about 
the employee's performance. They conduct performance appraisals on a regular basis, 
including assessing how the employee has performed and what they can do to improve 
in their jobs. They develop performance improvement plans if an employee's performance 
is not adequate. In addition, supervisors provide rewards for employee accomplishments.
