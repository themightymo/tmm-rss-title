<h1>Business Development -- Growing Your For-Profit or Nonprofit
Organization</h1>

<!--[index|Organizational Development]-->
<p>&copy; Copyright <a
href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter McNamara, 
  MBA, PhD</a></p>

<p>Whether your organization is a for-profit or nonprofit, you
have to address certain considerations and make certain decisions
if you set out to intentionally expand -- or grow -- your organization,
products and/or services. You can grow your organization, products
and/or services just by managing them well, for example, by having
very good products and services that are sold with strong sales
and customer service. However, this topic in the Library is for
those with an explicit goal to intentionally grow the organization,
product or service.</p>

<p>Notes About Terms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The phrase <b>business development</b> is so common and broad
  in nature that it means many different things to many different
  people. In this Library topic, the phrase means growing -- or
  expanding -- an organization, product and/or service, including
  by starting a new product or service, if necessary.</li>
  <li>The phrase &quot;business development&quot; traditionally
  does not refer to starting a new organization. For information
  relevant to that activity, see <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/preparation.htm"
  class="textlink">Entrepreneurs -- Are You Really Ready to Start
  a New Organization?</a>, <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/starting-business.htm">Starting
  a Business</a> or <a href="http://managementhelp.org/startingorganizations/start-nonprofit.htm"
  class="textlink">Starting a Nonprofit</a>.</li>
  <li>The term &quot;development&quot; could mean strengthening,
  rather than expanding, the organization, products or services.
  However, business development traditionally has not meant primarily
  the process of strengthening; rather, it's meant growth or expansion.</li>
  <li>Certainly, many people would agree that it's more important
  to be sustainable than to grow (although growth could be done,
  but sustainably). For those people, see the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalsustainability/index.htm"
  class="textlink">Organizational Sustainability</a>.</li>
  <li>Although the guidelines in this section apply to growing
  an organization, product or service, the term &quot;organization&quot;
  is used to apply to either of these three -- this is to avoid
  tedious duplication of terms throughout this topic.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Understanding Life Cycles of Organizations, Products and Services</h2>

<p>Organizations go through certain life cycles just like other
systems, including people, plants and animals. When setting out
to intentional grow, it really helps organizational leaders to
understand the nature of each of these cycles and the challenges
in moving from one cycle to another. When reading the following
articles, think about what life cycle your organization, product
or service is in. <br />

whether to grow or not -- you don't have to grow it if you don't
want to.<br />

<h2>Evaluate Your Organization -- What Are You Starting From?
What Do You Need to Fix First?</h2>

<p>Before you start major activities to grow your organization,
you should first get a realistic impression of how your organization
is doing now. There are a variety of tools that you can use to
get a quick impression.<br />

<h2>Getting Professional Help</h2>

<p>You may need to raise funds to finance your growth (we'll address
more on this consideration a little later). For example, an Organization
Development expert can be very helpful. Organizations often face
the same types of challenges when growing. Organizational leaders
often face the same types of challenges, as well. <br />

<p>Seriously consider getting an accountant who is experienced

<h2>Planned Growth -- Strategic and Business Planning</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to carefully think through how you want
to grow your organization, product or service is through the use
of business planning -- many people might refer to this as business
development planning to produce a Business Development Plan. Business
planning applies to for-profits and nonprofits (in the case of
nonprofits, business planning is sometimes associated with <a
href="http://managementhelp.org/socialenterprise/index.htm" class="textlink">Social
Enterprise</a>.) (Many people believe that strategic planning
should focused on the entire organization, while business planning
should be focused on a particular product or service -- thus,
business planning is repeated in the section, below, about growing
a product or service.)<br />

<h2>Planned Growth -- Organizational Change and Development (Managing
Change)</h2>

<p>Organizations are changing today like never before. Over the
last ten years or so, there has been a dramatic increase in the
amount of literature about organizational change. <br />
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/guides/change.html" target="_blank">Organizational
Change</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor586222"></a></p>

<h2>Ways to Grow -- Organizational Alliances</h2>

<p>Another way to grow your organization is to merge with another
organization or form a joint venture.<br />

Alliances (collaborations, joint ventures, acquisitions, mergers)</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor913837"></a></p>

<h2>Ways to Grow -- Buying a Franchise</h2>

<p>In some cases, you may be better off to buy a franchise, that
is, a business strategy and structure that has been proven to
work in other markets and your challenge is to set up your franchise
in your locale. Many people might assert that this is not a form
of business development; rather, it's entrepreneurship in starting
a new organization. <br />

and Financing a Franchise</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor586670"></a></p>

<h2>Ways to Grow -- Buying a Business</h2>

<p>You can also grow your organization by buying another organization,
or one or more of its product lines. Note that a nonprofit typically
cannot be &quot;bought,&quot; as it is owned by the public, not
by individuals or stockholders. Similar to buying a franchise,
many people might assert that this is not a form of business development;
rather, it's entrepreneurship in starting a new organization.

<p><a name="anchor587049"></a></p>

<h2>Ways to Grow -- Product and/or Market Development</h2>

<p>Quite often, the best way to grow an organization is to grow
your markets. For example, organizations can generate revenue
from understanding the <a href="http://www.12manage.com/methods_productmarketgrid.html"
class="textlink">Product/Market Grid</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Selling more of the current products to more of the current
  customers (customer maximization)</li>
  <li>Selling more of the current products to new customers (customer
  development)</li>
  <li>Selling new products to current customers (product development)</li>
  <li>And/to selling new products to new customers (diversification).</li>
