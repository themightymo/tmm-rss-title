<h1>Thinking About
Organizations as Systems</h1>

<p>Recently, management studies has come
to view organizations from a new perspective: a systems perspective.
This systems perspective may seem quite basic. Yet, decades of
management training and practices in the workplace have not followed
from this perspective. Only recently, with tremendous changes
facing organizations and how they operate, have educators and
managers come to face this new way of looking at things. This
interpretation has brought about a significant change (or paradigm
shift) in the way management studies and approaches organizations.

<h2>What is a System?</h2>

Very simply, a system is a collection of parts (or subsystems)
integrated to accomplish an overall goal (a system of people is
an organization). Systems have input, processes, outputs and outcomes,
with ongoing feedback among these various parts. If one part of
the system is removed, the nature of the system is changed.</p>

<p>Systems range from very simple to
very complex. 
There are numerous types of systems. For
example, there are biological systems (the heart, etc.), mechanical
systems (thermostat, etc.), human/mechanical systems (riding a
bicycle, etc.), ecological systems (predator/prey, etc.), and
social systems (groups, supply and demand, friendship, etc.).</p>

<p>Complex systems, such as social systems, are comprised of numerous
subsystems, as well. These subsystems are arranged in hierarchies,
and integrated to accomplish the overall goal of the overall system.
Each subsystem has its own boundaries of sorts, and includes various
inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes geared to accomplish an
overall goal for the subsystem.</p>

<p>A pile of sand is not a system. If
one removes a sand particle, you've still got a pile of sand.
However, a functioning car is a system. Remove the carburetor
and you've no longer got a working car.

<h2>Why is it Important to Look at Organizations as Systems?</h2>

The effect of this systems theory in management is that writers,
educators, consultants, etc. are helping managers to look at organizations
from a broader perspective. Systems theory has brought a new perspective
for managers to interpret patterns and events in their organizations.
In the past, managers typically took one part and focused on that.
Then they moved all attention to another part. The problem was
that an organization could, e.g., have wonderful departments that
operate well by themselves but don't integrate well together.
Consequently, the organization suffers as a whole.</p>

<p>Now, more managers are recognizing
the various parts of the organization, and, in particular, the
interrelations of the parts, e.g., the coordination of central
offices with other departments, engineering with manufacturing,
supervisors with workers, etc. Managers now focus more attention
on matters of ongoing organization and feedback. Managers now
diagnose problems, not by examining what appear to be separate
pieces of the organization, but by recognizing larger patterns
of interactions. Managers maintain perspective by focusing on
the outcomes they want from their organizations. Now managers
focus on structures that provoke behaviors that determine events
-- rather than reacting to events as was always done in the past.

<h2>Systems Theory,
Systems Analysis and Systems Thinking</h2>


One of the major breakthroughs in understanding the complex world
of systems is systems theory. The application of this theory is
called systems analysis. One of the tools of systems analysis
is systems thinking. Very basically, systems thinking is a way
of helping a person to view the world, including its organizations,
from a broad perspective that includes structures, patterns and
events, rather than just the events themselves. This broad view
helps one to identify the real causes of issues and know where
to work to address them.</p>

<h3>Systems Principles -- Some Examples</h3>
<p>
Systems theory has identified numerous principles that are common
to systems, many of which help us to better understand organizations.
One of the best descriptions of systems principles is in the booklet
&quot;Systems 1: An Introduction to Systems Thinking&quot; by
Draper L. Kauffman, Jr., edited by Stephen. A. Carlton (from The
Innovative Learning Series by Futures Systems, Inc., 1980, Stephen.A.Carlton,
Publisher, Minneapolis, MN (612) 920-0060). The following is adapted
from that booklet.</p>

<p><i>The system's overall behavior depends on its entire structure
(not the sum of its various parts).</i><br />
The structure determines the various behaviors, which determine
the various events. Too often, we only see and respond to the
events. That's why, especially in the early parts of our lives,
we can be so short-sighted and reactionary in our lives and in
our work. We miss the broader scheme of things.</p>

<p>Too often in organizations (and in management training programs),
we think we can break up the system and only have to deal with
its parts or with various topics apart from other topics. Systems
theory reminds us that if you break up an elephant, you don't
have a bunch of little elephants.</p>

<p><i>There is an optimum size for a system.</i><br />
If we try to make the system any larger, it'll try to break
itself up in order to achieve more stability. Too often in our
organizations, we continually strive to keep on growing -- until
the reality of the system intervenes. At this point, we again
only see the events, not the behaviors or the structures that
cause them. So we embark on short-sighted strategies to fix events,
often only causing more problems for ourselves and others.</p>

<p>There are numerous other systems principles, e.g.,<br />
- Systems tend to seek balance with their environments<br />
- Systems that do not interact with their environment (e.g., get
feedback from customers) tend to reach limits</p>

<p><i>A circular relationship exists between the overall system
and its parts.</i><br />
Ever notice how an organization seems to experience the same
kinds of problems over and over again? The problems seem to cycle
through the organization. Over time, members of the organization
come to recognize the pattern of events in the cycle, rather than
the cycle itself. Parents notice this as they mature as parents.
Over time, they recognize the various phases their children go
through and consider these phases when dealing with the specific
behaviors of their children.</p>

<h2>For Additional Information</h2>

Peter Senge's book, <i>The Fifth Discipline</i> (Doubleday,
1990), and its companion, <i>The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook</i> (Doubleday,
1994), are seminal works about systems thinking and its application
to organizations.</p>

<h3>Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>
Just as there are principles common to systems, there
are principles in the seemingly chaotic and randomized world of
many, many systems. Chaos theory includes the study of this complex
world in order to identify principles from which to better understand
our world and its organizations. For more information, see<br />
