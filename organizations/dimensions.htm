take certain features into consideration, e.g., how many rooms
it has, the color of its walls, slope of its roof, etc. A
person can consider the following dimensions when analyzing an
organization.

<p>Richard Daft in his book, <i>Organizational
Theory and Design</i> (West Publishing, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1992),
organizes these dimensions into categories of structural and contextual.</p>

<a name="anchor1973969"></a>
<h2>Structural
dimensions: </h2>
<p><b><i>Centralization</i>
</b> -the extent to which functions are dispersed
in the organization, either in terms of integration with other
functions or geographically</p>

<p><b><i>Formalization</i>
</b> - regarding the extent of policies and procedures
in the organization</p>

<p><b><i>Hierarchy</i>
</b>

- regarding the extent and
configuration of levels in the structure
</p>

<p><b><i>Routinization</i>
</b>
 - regarding the extent that organizational
processes are standardized</p>

<p><b><i>Specialization</i>
</b>
 - regarding the extent to which activities
are refined</p>

<p><b><i>Training</i>
</b>
 - regrading the extent of activities to equip
organization members with knowledge and skills to carry out their
roles</p>

<p>
<a name="anchor1975238"></a>
<h2>Contextual
Dimensions</h2>
<p><b><i>Culture</i>
</b>- the values and beliefs shared
by all (note that culture is often discerned by examining norms
or observable behaviors in the workplace)
</p>

<p><b><i>Environment</i>
</b>- the
nature of external influences and activities in the political,
technical, social and economic arenas
</p>

<p><b><i>Goals</i>
</b>

- unique overall priorities
and desired end-states of the organization
</p>

<p><b><i>Size</i>
</b>

- number of people and resources
and their span in the organization
</p>

<p><b><i>Technology</i>

-</b>
 the often unique activities
needed to reach organizational goals, including nature of activities,
specialization, type of equipment/facilities needed, etc.
