<p>Managing a successful organization (nonprofit or for-profit)
-- or building up the health of an already established organization
-- requires healthy, ongoing leadership and management, planning,
product and service development, marketing and financial management.
To carry out these practices in a healthy manner, it's important
to first understand the basic &quot;territory&quot; in which these
practices are carried out.</p>

<p>These practices are all &quot;systems&quot; that occur within
the larger system of the organization. This is not academic talk
-- this is a highly practical point to understand. To truly understand
and to be effective at these practices, it helps greatly if leaders,
managers and employees have some basic understanding of the overall
system of the organization, including its common dimensions, cultures
and life cycles. Too often, this basic nature is not understood.
Instead, people tend to focus only on the day-to-day events and
then when problems occur, they don't see the big picture in order
to resolve these problems for the long term. Consequently, they
mistakenly focus on what's urgent, rather than on what's important
-- if you focus on what's important, you'll reduce what's urgent.
