<h2><a name="part1" id="part1"></a>Basic Principles of Organizational Design</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://www.resourcesforchange.net/" target="_blank">Jim Smith</a></p>
<p>Some years ago Albert Cherns, an important figure in the Norwegian work redesign 
  efforts highlighted some important Principles of Social and Technical Systems 
  Design. The Principles of Organization Design have been known for 30 years in 
  the academic and consulting community. Knowing the principles and implementing 
  them are clearly two different things. First, I will detail the principles and 
  following that I will highlight what has made the implementation so difficult.</p>
<h3>1. Complementarities</h3>
<p>How we go about restructuring needs to be compatible with what we are trying 
  to achieve by the restructuring. The process of design must be complementary 
  with the objectives. This means the design and implementation process is critical. 
  If you want flexibility and participation within the work group as an output 
  of the design, then how you go about designing the organization has to be flexible, 
  interactive and participatory.</p>
<p>If the completed work system will depend upon high levels of meaningful flexibility 
  in accomplishing the work, then it is through a process of meaningful flexibility 
  that the system needs to be built. The &#8220;means&#8221; have to be complimentary 
  with the &#8220;ends&#8221;. In other words, if you want a system where people 
  assume responsibility, then people have to be responsibly involved in creating 
  the work system or you won&#8217;t get it. We do not get participative highly 
  effective organizations by fiat.</p>
<h3>2. Minimal Critical Specification</h3>
<p>New technologies require people to learn and change. These abilities have to 
  be developed through the work itself. Therefore, specify as little as possible 
  concerning how tasks combine into jobs and how people are to interact within 
  jobs. The creation of a well-designed work team must involve dialogue and decisions 
  being made by the people involved. Most teams struggle from over-structure, 
  which is based in job descriptions and compensation schemes, which result in 
  &#8220;that&#8217;s not my job&#8221;. The trick in building a team that works 
  is to specify no more than is absolutely necessary about the task or how jobs 
  relate to the task, or how people relate to individual jobs. To build a high 
  performance team the rule is to FIX as little as possible. This means to identify 
  and specify no more than what is absolutely critical. Generally the critical 
  information is about output expected. The vision of results is very important 
  and has to be co-constructed with the group but more than anything you want 
  to build an organic ability to learn and change into the team.</p>
<h3>3. Variance Control</h3>
<p>Support and reward groups that deal with errors at the point of origin. Effective 
  teams need the legitimacy to find out where things go wrong and deal with variance 
  where it occurs. The goal is to minimize exporting problems to others. The assumption 
  that is safe to make is that people know what good work looks like. Exporting 
  problems and unsatisfied customer needs is the mark of a team that lacks options.</p>
<h3>4. Clear Goals and Flexible Strategies</h3>
<p>Define what is expected in terms of performance early and clearly and then 
  support adaptations toward appropriate means by which the group can achieve 
  ends. (Do not over-specify.) This is an adaptability principle, which recognizes 
  that we are designing living systems rather than machines. With living systems, 
  the same ends can be reached by different means. There are a lot of ways to 
  solve problems and meet a customers needs. What is critical here is the definition 
  and understanding of the end goal. The &#8220;What&#8221; is to be highly specified. 
  The &#8220;How&#8221; is open to local decision and initiative. This enables 
  learning and an increased sense of &#8220;efficacy&#8221; on the part of team 
  members. Efficacy is the sense that we are effective as a team that we can make 
  a difference and do the job well. Efficacy is fragile and needs to be supported 
  by continuous learning and improvement. High performance teams constantly &#8220;tinker&#8221; 
  with the means by which they accomplish their results. They seldom settle on 
  &#8220;one best way&#8221;</p>
<h3>5. Boundary Location and Control</h3>
<p>Supervisors and managers have to grow to become more comfortable performing 
  a role as a group resource, a beacon of coming changes and a coordinator across 
  task group boundaries.</p>
<p>Traditional organizations group by: time, technology or territory. The weakness 
  of this is that boundaries interfere with the desirable sharing of knowledge 
  and experience and so learning suffers. The consistent social-technical message 
  is if there are supervisors, they manage the boundaries as a group resource, 
  insuring the group has adequate resources, coordinating activities with other 
  groups and foreseeing coming changes. More and more these resource positions 
  are disappearing as groups become more self-regulating. Often the presence of 
  supervisors is an indication of a lack of success in a groups design, or unwillingness 
  at higher levels to trust based upon a poor job of building the structure. When 
  it is done right supervisors are superfluous at best and harmful at worse.</p>
<h3>6. Information Flow</h3>
<p>Teams have to be deeply involved to determine what and where information is 
  needed for self-direction. There needs to be a management commitment to provide 
  information for task performance and learning. Information has to be provided 
  where it is needed for self-direction, learning, and task improvement. Control 
  has to be subordinated to achievement.</p>
<h3>7. Support Congruence</h3>
<p>Goals, reward and support systems that integrate required behaviors have to 
  be consistent. The reward and support systems have to be consistent with goals. 
  Incentives have to be realigned to support team-based work structures. Individual 
  based compensation systems are being modified continually to support many different 
  team structures. Skill-based schemes and gain sharing are foundations for high 
  performance.</p>
<h3>8. Design and Human Values</h3>
<p>Task and organization design has to be oriented toward improving both the technical 
  and the human components of the organization. The process of design must address 
  the need for variation and meaning in work. It has to take into account the 
  needs for continuous learning, involvement in decision-making, help and support 
  between colleagues, and meaningful relationship between work and outside society, 
  a desirable future. A re-design enterprise will be successful only if it unites 
  a process of organization development, which includes work restructuring combined 
  with a planning process that is both interactive and participatory.</p>
<h3>9. Incompletion</h3>
<p>Design is a continuous commitment, a reiterative process. A design is a solution, 
  which inevitably has to be changed, therefore it is critical to build learning 
  and change ability into the team. Management has to appreciate that organization 
  design toward high performance is a continuous process. What has to be learned 
  is the process of design because it is a never-ending necessity. Deep in our 
  organizations, people have to learn how to periodically re-fashion their organizational 
  arrangements. Everything falls out of balance and has to be reviewed with an 
  eye toward deciding upon changes necessary. In the early stages learning how 
  to redesign is often more important than the design itself. The design will 
  change over time and learning how to do it is a team life skill.</p>
<p>The basic message is that if you want people to assume responsibility for the 
  work process you have to involve them in the work redesign process itself. Responsibility 
  is the essence of self-management. To accept responsibility people have to define 
  and make decisions. The tendency is for management to hand the operational people 
  an output of redesign thinking done by others, and expect them to work it. Expecting 
  also, the supervisors to supervise the implementation of a design which management 
  has completed. The trick of organizing for real teamwork is getting everyone 
  involved in the total systems improvement.</p>

<h2><a name="charts" id="charts"></a>Developing Organization Charts</h2>
<p>Organization charts (or "org charts" as they affectionately are known) are graphical depictions of the official roles/positions in the organization 
and their relationship to each other, e.g., the top position and authority in the organization and then what other positions formally report to 
which other positions throughout the organization.  Org charts are very common, especially in organizations with 5 or more people.  The following 
guidelines will help you to understand org charts and how to develop them for your own organization.  </p>
