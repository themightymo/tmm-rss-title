<p>NOTE: Many people would argue that a nonprofit organization is also a business 
  organization, if they believe that a business is an organization that provides 
  value to consumers and gets suitable value in return.</p>

<h2>For-Profit (Business) Organizations</h2>

A for-profit organization exists primarily to generate
a profit, that is, to take in more money than it spends. The owners
can decide to keep all the profit themselves, or they can spend
some or all of it on the business itself. Or, they may decide
to share some of it with employees through the use of various
types of compensation plans, e.g., employee profit sharing.</p>

<p>(We'll read later about the legal forms of a for-profit, including
sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations.  More information is available back in the main category 
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/org_thry/org_thry.htm" target="_blank">Introduction to Organizations</a>.</p>

<h2>Nonprofit
Organizations </h2>

(The
following information, in large part, was developed by Putnam
Barber, President of the Evergreen State Society in Seattle, Washington)
<br />
A nonprofit organization exists to provide a particular service
to the community. The word &quot;nonprofit&quot; refers to a type
of business -- one which is organized under rules that forbid
the distribution of profits to owners. &quot;Profit&quot; in this
context is a relatively technical accounting term, related to
but not identical with the notion of a surplus of revenues over
expenditures.</p>

<p>Most nonprofits businesses are organized
into corporations. Most corporations are formed under the corporations
laws of a particular state. Every state has provisions for forming
nonprofit corporations; some permit other forms, such as unincorporated
associations, trusts, etc., which may operate as nonprofit businesses
on slightly (but sometimes importantly) different terms.
</p>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
gets involved because corporations are, in general, required to
pay federal corporate income taxes on their net earning (another
technical term, pointing to a slightly different way to the idea
of a surplus of revenue over expenses).
</p>

<p>Section 501 of the Internal Revenue
Code lists several circumstances under which corporations are
exempt from these taxes. Section 501(c)(3) -- the famous one --
describes corporations (1) serving charitable, religious, scientific
or educational purposes (2) no part of the income of which &quot;inures
to the benefit of&quot; anyone.
</p>

<p>Tax-exempt nonprofit corporations
can, and do, operate in all other particulars like any other sort
of business. They have bank accounts; own productive assets of
all kinds; receive income from sales and other forms of activity,
including donations and grants if they are successful at finding
that sort of support; make and hold passive investments; employ
staff; enter into contracts of all sorts; etc.
</p>

<p>There are some specialized tax rules
and accounting practices that apply to nonprofit corporations.
If they are of a certain size, they are required to disclose many
details of their operations to the general public and to state
regulators and watchdog agencies using IRS form 990. This form
shows any salaries paid to officers or directors and to the five
highest-paid employees and contracts if any receive over $50,000
in the tax year (at the time of this writing in 1998). The form
also requires the organization to divide its expenses into &quot;functional
categories&quot; -- program, administration and fund-raising --
and report the totals for each along with the amounts expended
on each program activity.</p>
