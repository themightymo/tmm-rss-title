<h2>Suggested Previous Reading</h2>

<p><br />
Note that the reader might best be served to first read the document
<a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/org_thry/org_thry.htm">Introduction
to Organizations</a> to understand the overall general nature
of all organizations. As noted in that document, today's leaders
are faced with continual change in their organizations. Consequently,
today's leaders should have a strong sense of what their organizations
are about. This document will accomplish that for nonprofit leaders.
<br />
<br />
An organization is a collection of resources arranged to accomplish
an overall goal. The purpose of a nonprofit organization is to
meet one or more needs in a community. Each nonprofit describes
its overall purpose in a mission statement. (Very simply put,
the word &quot;nonprofit&quot; means an organization that does
not distribute a profit.) <br />
<br />
Typical types of nonprofit services are advocacy, arts, civic,
cultural, education, health and human service. Nonprofits range
in size from extremely large (e.g., Red Cross, large hospitals,
etc.) to extremely small (e.g., organizations that have no full-time
personnel, and operate only with volunteers). <br />

<h2>What is a &quot;Nonprofit&quot;?</h2>

<h3>Some Basics ...</h3>

<p>(by Carter McNamara)<br />
Before you start your nonprofit, it's helpful to realize that
the phrase &quot;starting a nonprofit&quot; can mean many things.
Read the following very basic information to begin thinking about
what you mean when you set out to &quot;start a nonprofit&quot;.</p>

<p>- You can be a nonprofit organization just by getting together
with some friends, eg, to form a self-help group. In this case,
you&#146;re an informal nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>- Consider incorporating your nonprofit so it exists as a separate
legal organization in order to a) own its own property and its
own bank account; b) ensure that the nonprofit can continue on
its own (even after you&#146;re gone); and c) protect yourself
personally for operations of the nonprofit. You incorporate your
nonprofit by filing articles of incorporation with the appropriate
local state office. (An incorporated nonprofit requires a board
of directors.)</p>

<p>- If you want to be exempt from federal taxes (and maybe some
other taxes, too), you should file with the IRS to be a tax-exempt
organization. (The IRS states that you must be a corporation,
community chest, fund, or foundation to receive tax-exempt status.
Articles of association may also be used in place of incorporation.)
(Probably the most well known type of nonprofits is a the IRS
classification of 501(c)(3), a &#147;charitable nonprofit&#146;.)</p>

<p>- Depending on the nature of your organization, you may also
granted tax-deductible status from the IRS. Publication 526 lists
the types of organizations to which donations are deductible.</p>

<p>- So, if you did all of these steps, you&#146;d be an incorporated,
tax-exempt nonprofit that could receive tax deductible donations.</p>

<p>- The particular steps you take depend on your plans for your
organization, including the nature of its services. They also
depend on how the IRS interprets the nature of your organization,
including its services.</p>

<h3>And Now Some Refinement on the Description of &quot;Nonprofit&quot;</h3>

<p>(by Putnam Barber)<br />
(Items in brackets &quot;[!]&quot; are added by Carter McNamara.)<br />
The word &quot;nonprofit&quot; refers to a type of business --
one which is organized under rules that forbid the distribution
of profits to owners. &quot;Profit&quot; in this context is a
relatively technical accounting term, related to but not identical
with the notion of a surplus of revenues over expenditures.</p>

<p>Most [registered!] nonprofits businesses are organized into
corporations [or associations!]. Most corporations are formed
under the corporations laws of a particular state. Every state
has provisions for forming nonprofit corporations; some permit
other forms, such as unincorporated associations, trusts, etc.,
which may operate as nonprofit businesses on slightly (but sometimes
importantly) different terms.</p>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gets involved because corporations
are, in general, required to pay federal corporate income taxes
on their net earning (another technical term, pointing to a slightly
different way to the idea of a surplus of revenue over expenses).</p>

<p>Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code lists several circumstances
under which corporations [or unincorporated nonprofits!] are exempt
from these taxes. Section 501(c)(3) -- the famous one -- describes
[nonprofit!] (1) serving charitable, religious, scientific or
educational purposes (2) no part of the income of which &quot;inures
to the benefit of&quot; anyone.</p>

<p>Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations can, and do, operate in
all other particulars like any other sort of business. They have
bank accounts; own productive assets of all kinds; receive income
from sales and other forms of activity, including donations and
grants if they are successful at finding that sort of support;
make and hold passive investments; employ staff; enter into contracts
of all sorts; etc.</p>

<p>There are some specialized tax rules and accounting practices
that apply to nonprofit organizations. If they are of a certain
size, they are required to disclose many details of their operations
to the general public and to state regulators and watchdog agencies
using IRS form 990. This form shows any salaries paid to officers
or directors [for incorporated nonprofits!] and to the five highest-paid
employees and contracts if any receive over $50,000 in the tax
year. The form also requires the organization to divide its expenses
into &quot;functional categories&quot; -- program, administration
and fund-raising -- and report the totals for each along with
the amounts expended on each program activity.</p>

<p>Nonprofit organizations file for tax-exemption by using IRS
Publication 557, &quot;<a class="textlink" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf"

<h2>Key Roles</h2>

<p>(by Carter McNamara) <br />
&middot; <b><i>Clients</i></b> - Everything in a nonprofit is
ultimately directed to serving clients. Clients are the &quot;consumers&quot;
or &quot;customers&quot; of the nonprofit's services. Note that
services can be in the form of tangible or intangible products.
<br />
&middot; <b><i>Board</i></b> - The board is comprised of individuals
from the community and, ideally, is representative of the organizations
clients. Law and theory dictate that the board is in charge, and
directly accountable for the overall direction and policies of
the organization. Powers are given to the board by the Articles
of Incorporation (or other governing document, for example, Articles
of Association, Constitution, etc.). The board can configure the
nonprofit in whatever structure it prefers to meet the organization's
mission and usually does so via specifications in bylaws. Members
of nonprofit boards are generally motivated by a desire to serve
the community and the personal satisfaction of volunteering. Nonprofit
board members may not receive monetary compensation for serving
on the board. See the library topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/index.htm">Boards</a>
for description of the overall responsibilities of a board, key
board roles, how meetings are carried out, etc. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Board Chair -</i></b> A board chair's role is central
to coordinating the work of the board, executive director and
committees. The chair's role may have appointive power for committees,
depending on what is specified about this role in the bylaws.
The power of the board chair is usually through persuasion and
general leadership. See the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/job-descriptions.htm#anchor321357">Board
Chair</a> for an overview of the board chair role. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Committees</i></b> - Typically, the board chooses
to carry out its operations using a variety of board committees.
The topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/boards/committees.htm">Description
of Typical Committees</a> for a description of typical board committees.
<br />
&middot; <b><i>Executive Director</i></b> - The board typically
chooses to have this one person who is ultimately responsible
to carry out the wishes of the board. The executive director is
directly accountable for the work of the staff and supports the
work of the board committees. For more information, see the library
topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/chiefexecutives/index.htm">Chief
Executive Role</a>. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Staff -</i></b> Staff report to the executive director
and may support the work of the committees. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Volunteers -</i></b> Volunteers are unpaid personnel
who assist staff, serve on committees and generally work under
the direction of the executive director. See the topic <a class="textlink" href="http://managementhelp.org/staffing/outsrcng/volnteer/volnteer.htm">Volunteer
Programs</a> for an understanding of the role of volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="anchor251653"></a></p>

<h2>Three Major Aspects of Nonprofit Structure</h2>

<p>(by Carter McNamara)<br />
Typically, the nonprofit operations are organized into major functions.
These functions usually include central administration and programs.
<br />
&middot; <b><i>Governance -</i></b> The governance function of
a nonprofit is responsible to provide overall strategic direction,
guidance and controls. Often the term &quot;governance&quot; refers
to board matters. However, many people are coming to consider
governance as a function carried out by the board and top management.
Effective of governance depends to a great extent on the working
relationship between board and top management. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Programs -</i></b> Typically, nonprofits work from
their overall mission, or purpose, to identify a few basic service
goals which must be reached to accomplish their mission. Resources
are organized into programs to reach each goal. It often helps
to think of programs in terms of inputs, process, outputs and
outcomes. Inputs are the various resources needed to run the program,
e.g., money, facilities, clients, program staff, etc. The process
is how the program is carried out, e.g., clients are counseled,
children are cared for, art is created, association members are
supported, etc. The outputs are the units of service, e.g., number
of clients counseled, children cared for, artistic pieces produced,
or members in the association. Outcomes are the impacts on the
clients receiving services, e.g., increased mental health, safe
and secure development, richer artistic appreciation and perspectives
in life, increased effectiveness among members, etc. <br />
&middot; <b><i>Central administration</i></b> - Central administration
is the staff and facilities that are common to running all programs.
This usually includes at least the executive director and office
personnel. Nonprofits usually strive to keep costs of central
administration low in proportion to costs to run programs.</p>

<h2>Current Major Challenge: Devolution</h2>

<p>(by Keri Poeppe)<br />
&quot;Devolution&quot; is a word used a great deal these days
among nonprofit funders and leaders. Essentially devolution is
the short-hand word for a strong trend of cutbacks in federal
funding to nonprofits (especially for programs such as welfare
(AFDC and certain SSI programs) and the resulting changes in responsibility
for administering such programs. Legislation passed by the Congress
reduces (and in some cases) eliminates a federal commitment to
automatically provide assistance to the poor. Instead, blocks
of funds (usually in reduced levels) will be passed through to
states, allowing them to decide who will receive aid and who will
not. Thus, devolution is associated with the end of what is often
called &#147;entitlements&#148; to services previously guaranteed
by the federal government.</p>

<p>While devolution provides opportunity for more local control
and possibly less bureaucratic waste, human services programs
will be at great risk due to reduced federal (and therefore state)
funding. Nonprofits (which, on average, receive approximately
30 percent of their revenues from federal sources) will suffer
significant loss of funds which may be very difficult to replace.
Meanwhile, public demand for human services continues to increase.</p>

<p>Devolution brings many challenges to nonprofit leaders. They
must operate more effectively in the face of reduced funding.
They must consider substantial changes in the way they have operated.
Concepts such as strategic alliances and restructuring will become
commonplace.</p>

<p><a name="anchor252108"></a></p>

<h2>Revenue: Fees and Fundraising</h2>

<p>(by Keri Poeppe)<br />
</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>Fees may be associated with these services and billed to either
the person receiving the service (e.g. the parent with a child
in daycare) or to a third party such as a government agency that
supports such services. Unlike the private sector where the price
of a product or service must cover all costs, nonprofit agencies
rarely meet all their costs based upon sales and fees. Instead
nonprofits must engage in fundraising and seek additional revenue
sources. <br />
<br />
It is important to note that while many nonprofits provide services
that are valuable to our community, it is often difficult to measure
the actual results of their services. Changes in an individual's
or a community's behavior may take years to be realized. Nonetheless,
nonprofits are challenged to demonstrate results as donors become
more savvy and funding sources become increasingly limited. <br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>Fundraising</h3>

<p>As noted above, nonprofit managers (and the board of directors)
must engage in fundraising in order to meet the fiscal needs of
their organization. Generally, fundraising is not one of an executive
director's favorite tasks. It can be an all-consuming activity,
tapping an executive director's creative and social energy. Executive
directors are constantly challenged to strike a balance between
the time they devote to fundraising and program management. Too
little attention to one area can leave an organization bereft
of cash or quality services. <br />
<br />
There are several basic sources of funding in the nonprofit sector.
The first is a grant. Grants may be given by government agencies,
foundations or corporations, usually to operate a specific program.
As noted earlier, agencies receiving government grants to operate
human service programs base their reimbursement on fees for the
services. Grants from foundations or corporations are generally
provided up front and require a report on program activities and
expenditures at the end of the grant period. <br />
<br />
Nonprofit organizations will solicit individuals for funds, also.
Individual donations may come from an organization's membership
or constituents (e.g. viewers of public television or residents
of a neighborhood community). These are generally small donations,
ideally from a large number of people. Sizable gifts may come
from individuals who are referred to as major donors. Cultivating
relationships with major donors requires the energy and resourcefulness
of the board and director. Many nonprofits will hold special events
to raise dollars. These vary from bake sales to major events.
<br />
<br />
Fundraising can be a full-time job (or a full-time obsession)
for nonprofit executive directors. Executive Directors are challenged
to balance their time between raising money and program management.
If too much time is spent on fundraising, programs and staff may
not get the direction and coaching they need. On the other hand,
if fundraising takes a back seat to program management, the organization's
cash flow will suffer. <br />
<br />
Two factors will enhance fundraising efforts. One is good programs.
Programs that are meeting important community needs and demonstrating
results will sell themselves. A board that is committed to its
fundraising responsibilities will also be an asset to the organization.
Board members who take their role in fundraising very seriously
will promote the organization and help bring resources to it.
<br />
<br />
It is important to note, however, how the political climate can
affect an organization's fundraising. Foundations and corporations
may choose specific issues or causes for priority in grantmaking.
In the 1980's organizations working with the elderly received
major support from foundations and the government. These same
organizations saw their support decrease as youth issues became
a major focus in the 1990's. <br />

<h2>Unique Nature and Struggles of Traditional Small Nonprofits</h2>

<p>(by Sandra Larson)<br />
</p>

<h3>The Heart of the Matter: Leadership and Management</h3>

<p>At the heart of any successful nonprofit is an effective chief
executive and board of directors. These leaders must work as a
team with vision, skill, and sufficient resources to accomplish
the organization's mission. While leadership is shared, critical
management skills must rest with the chief executive. However,
the board must be sufficiently skilled in management to assess
the work of this director and assist in strategic decision making.
<br />
</p>

<h3>Values as the Bottom Line</h3>

<p>Values are the driving force in a nonprofit. The bottom line
is the realization of a social mission, not profits. This poses
complex problems for the leadership team. How are programs agreed
upon, progress monitored, and success measured? How are priorities
set and consensus reached? How are staff rewarded and what control
systems are applicable? Skilled consultants may be needed from
time to time to assist the team in answering these qualitative,
value-laden questions and focus on appropriate management systems.
<br />
</p>

<h3>Nonprofit Personnel are Often Highly Diverse</h3>

<p>Diversity is reflected, not only by different races and ethnic
groups, but ultimately by different values and perspectives. This
strong diversity is a major benefit to the nonprofit because input
from a wide variety of perspectives usually ensures complete consideration
of situations and new ideas. However, nonprofit personnel must
ensure they cultivate and remain open to the various values and
perspectives. <br />
</p>

<h3>Problems are Especially Complex for the Small Nonprofit</h3>

<p>The majority of nonprofits have small staffs and small budgets,
e.g., less than $500,000, which compounds the leadership and management
problems they face, especially given their charters and the magnitude
of community needs with which they deal. Those new to nonprofits
may react that, because nonprofits tend to be small in size, issues
in nonprofits should be simple in nature. On the contrary, the
vast majority of organizations (regardless of size) experience
similar issues, e.g., challenges in planning, organizing, motivating
and guiding. However, when these issues are focused in a small
organization, the nature of the organization becomes very dynamic
and complex. <br />
</p>

<h3>Sufficient Resources to Pay Leadership May Be Lacking</h3>

<p>With lack of sufficient moneys, attracting and retaining paid
management also can be problematic. Hard work with little career
development opportunity encourages turnover of chief executives
and staff. This can stall the organization's work. Expertise that
is brought in to advise the management may be lost once that leadership
leaves. <br />
</p>

<h3>Lack of Managerial Training is Problematic for the Small Nonprofit</h3>

<p>Many nonprofit managers have been promoted primarily out of
non-management disciplines and do not have the managerial skills
that are needed to run a nonprofit organization. Training and
consultation can do much to help these new leaders/managers gain
the skills they seek and help them up a myriad of learning curves
that rainbow out in front of them. <br />
</p>

<h3>Chief Executives Wear Too Many Hats</h3>

<p>A nonprofit chief executive has to be a current expert in planning,
marketing, information management, telecommunications, property
management, personnel, finance, systems design, fundraising and
program evaluation. Obviously this is not possible, regardless
of size. A larger organization may be able to hire some internal
experts, but this is certainly not the case for the smaller organization.
Furthermore, the technology of management progresses today too
rapidly for the non-specialist to keep abreast of new thinking
and expertise, whatever the size. Outside expertise therefore
is often a must for both the large and small organization. <br />
</p>

<h3>Too Small to Justify or Pay for Expensive Outside Advice</h3>

<p>Most nonprofits, even larger ones, often hesitate to spend
money on administrative &quot;overhead&quot; such as consultants
or other outside experts because this is seen as diverting valuable
dollars from direct service. Of course, most nonprofits have no
choice. They don't have enough money to even consider hiring consultants
at for-profit rates. Low-cost, volunteer-based assistance often
is an appropriate solution. <br />
</p>

<h3>One-shot Assistance Often is Not Enough</h3>

<p>While most consultant organizations want to teach managers
&quot;how to fish&quot; rather than give them a &quot;fish,&quot;
&quot;fishing&quot; (management skills) is not something that
often can be learned in one consultation. Especially in more technical
arenas such as computerization, learning comes while grappling
with an issue or management problem over a period of time. Building
internal management capacity takes more time than a one-shot consultation.
Repeat help therefore is not a sign of failure but of growth --
a new need to know has surfaced. <br />
</p>

<h3>Networks are Lacking</h3>

<p>Everyone outside the nonprofit sector observes, &quot;Why don't
those chief executives get together more, share more ideas, undertake
cooperative ventures?&quot; There are many reasons. First of all,
running a successful organization (delivering the quality service
that fulfills the organization's mission) isn't enough. Most nonprofit
directors run a second business -- raising money to support the
first. Both are complex and very time-consuming activities, especially
when the director wears all the management hats. Second, developing
networks or researching joint ventures is time-consuming, expensive
and risky. <br />
</p>

<h3>Nonprofits Usually Have Little Time and Money</h3>

<p>Funders do not seem to think research and development activity
justifies new expenditures; at least many are hesitant to fund
what might not succeed. While nonprofits may be more entrepreneurial
than funders, they have little capital to risk. Collaborative
planning will be enhanced by computerization and telecommunications,
but these investments also are difficult to fund. In some ways,
affordable consultants can substitute for expensive, up-front
research and development costs, at least at the feasibility level.
In many cases, they can carry an organization through the needed
planning to actually develop a new system of collaboration, merger,
or automation. <br />
</p>

<h3>Nonprofits Need Low-Cost Management and Technical Assistance</h3>

<p>Nonprofits are valuable community assets that must be effectively
managed. The need to provide affordable, accessible management
and technical assistance to nonprofit organizations is clear for
all the reasons stated above: the complexity of the task, the
lack of board and internal expertise, the lack of time and money,
changing needs, the learning curve, and, finally the importance
of the results to the community. What is well done is based on
what is well run.<br />
</p>

<h3>Typical Nature of Planning in Nonprofits</h3>

<p>For most nonprofits, they don't have a lot of time, money,
or resources for sophisticated, comprehensive strategic planning.
The focus is usually on the major issues facing the nonprofit
and quickly addressing them. Typical major challenges for the
facilitator are basic training of personnel about planning concepts
and process, helping the nonprofit to focus and sustain its limited
resources on planning, ensuring strategies are really strategic
rather than operational/efficiency measures, and helping design
small and focused planning meetings that produce realistic plans
that become implemented.</p>
