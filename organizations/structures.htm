<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The organization's structure, or design, is the overall arrangement
of the organization's various roles, processes and their relationships
in the organization. The design of an organization is a <i>means</i>
to accomplishing the organization's overall goal -- the structure
is not an end in itself. In systems theory terms, the design ensures
that the appropriate inputs go through the necessary processes
to produce the required outputs to produce the intended outcomes.</p>

<h2>Broad Overview of Primary Legal Forms of For-Profit Business
Organizations</h2>

<p>For-profit businesses are usually of three primary legal forms,
including unincorporated, corporations and limited liability companies.
There are other forms of businesses, too, for example, nonprofit,
franchises, government-owned corporations, cooperatives, limited
liability corporation (&quot;L3C&quot;), etc. The three primary
forms are explained below. (More information is available in the
topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/enterprise-corporate-laws.htm"
class="textlink">Enterprise Law</a>.)</p>

<p>A corporation is a <b><i>privately owned corporation</i></b>
or a <b><i>publicly held corporation</i></b>, depending on whether
the corporation is owned privately or by the public at large.</p>

<p>Business people should seek the counsel of a lawyer when determining
what legal form of business they should choose.</p>

<h3>1. Unincorporated (sole proprietorships or partnerships)</h3>

<p>Most small for-profit businesses are unincorporated. As an
unincorporated organization, you can be a sole proprietor or in
a partnership. A sole proprietorship is owned by one person or
a marriage. Business activity is viewed by the IRS as your personal
activity, for example, business income and taxes are viewed as
your personal income and taxes. The sole proprietor is personally
liable for the business.</p>

<p>A partnership can be a general partnership or a limited partnership.
A general partnership is viewed by the IRS essentially as two
or more sole proprietors equally responsible for the business.
The terms of sole proprietorship apply fully to each partner.
In limited partnership includes one or more general partners and
one or more limited partners. Limited partners are liable for
activities of the business to the extent of their investment.</p>

Proprietorship (IRS)</a></p>

<h3>2. Corporations (C Corporations and S Corporations)</h3>

<p>A corporation is formed as its own legal entity, apart from
the individuals who own and/or formed the organization. (The corporation
can be either for-profit or nonprofit. More on nonprofits later
on below.). The principals of a for-profit business decide to
incorporate mostly to shield them for personal liability for activities
of the business and/or to sell stock in the business. A corporate
<b><i>Boards of Directors</i></b> oversees policy and strategy
for corporations, whether for-profit or nonprofit. Principals
and board members of for-profit corporations typically have little
or no liability for operations of the corporation, unless the
owners or board members broke federal and/or state laws in running
the corporation.</p>

<p>Theoretically the for-profit and nonprofit corporation exists
forever, past the death of its owners. For-profit corporations
can be a C Corporation or Subchapter S Corporation. More about
these in the topic <a href="http://managementhelp.org/businesslaw/enterprise-corporate-laws.htm"
class="textlink">Enterprise Law</a>.)</p>

<h3>3. Limited Liability Companies (LLC)</h3>

<p>The LLC is a relatively new form that combines the advantages
of a corporation (minimum personal liability, selling stock, etc.)
with those of a sole proprietorship and partnership (sharing management
decisions, profit, etc). The LLC is an increasingly popular form
of organization.</p>

<h2>Broad Overview of Primary Legal Form of Non-Profit Business
Organizations</h2>

<p>As noted above, for-profit businesses are usually of three
legal forms, including unincorporated, corporations and limited
liability companies. There are other forms of businesses, too,
for example, nonprofit, franchises, government-owned corporations,
cooperatives, etc. The following link provides more information
about nonprofits, including their many legal forms. <br />

is a Nonprofit?</a></p>

<p><a name="anchor1630203"></a></p>

<h2>Traditional Structures of Business Organizations</h2>

<p>(Numerous driving forces are causing dramatic changes in how
organizations design themselves to conduct business effectively.
These new designs are used organization wide or for various teams
in the organization. The new designs are self-organizing, self-directing
or self-managing in nature. More modern designs will be discussed
later in <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizations/new-structures.htm"
class="textlink">Emerging Nature and New Organizational Structures</a>.
The following three structures are quite traditional. )</p>

<p>Note that a business can be any of the above legal forms and
in any of the following structures.</p>

<h3>Functional Structure</h3>

<p>Most business organizations start out with a functional structure,
or a small variation of this structure. This is the basic &quot;building
block&quot; for other structures. In this structure, there is
a central office which oversees various departments or major functions,
e.g., human resources, finances, sales, marketing, engineering,
etc. Think of a picture that has a box at the top labeled &quot;Central
Office&quot;. Think of a row of boxes underneath the top box.
Each box is labeled, e.g., sales, engineering, human resources,
etc. Connect the boxes with lines coming down from the top box
to each of the boxes below.</p>

<h3>Divisional Structure</h3>

<p>In this structure, there is a centralized corporate office
and under it, are various divisions each of which is dedicated
to producing and / or selling a certain type of business or product,
e.g., product 1, product 2, etc.. Each division that is dedicated
to a certain business or product is, in turn, is organized as
its own functional structure. So, for example, the division dedicated
to making product 1 has its own sales department, human resources,
etc. Basically, the divisional structure is a bunch of functional
structures each of which reports to one central office.</p>

<h3>Matrix Structure</h3>

<p>Think of the functional structure. Imagine if you took someone
from each of the major functions in the functional structure (the
boxes along the bottom of the organization chart), e.g., people
from sales, engineering, etc., and organized them into a separate
group intended to produce and sell one certain kind of product
or service. Members of this group stay together until that product
is produced or they continue to sell and service it. This overall
structure (made up of a functional structure that also has groups
assigned to products) is a matrix structure. This structure is
useful because it focuses highly skilled people from across the
organization to work on a complex product or service. It can be
difficult, though, because each person essentially reports to
two supervisors: the supervisor of the functional area (e.g.,
engineering) and the product manager, as well.</p>

<h2>Typical Structure of a Small, For-Profit Business Organization</h2>

<p>NOTE: At the time of this writing, I am not aware of any studies
that report the specifications and primary designs of small, for-profit
businesses. Thus, the following information is anecdotal.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following description is <i>not</i> meant to imply
that all new, small for-profit organizations should follow this
typical structure.</p>

<p>It seems that the typical, small for-profit business is a form
of functional structure. An entrepreneur forms a sole proprietorship,
or two or more entrepreneurs form a partnership. Employees are
hired to do whatever tasks, jobs and roles are needed to help
the business to survive. Over time, certain activities become
ongoing and in support of other activities in the business. These
ongoing, support activities become a &quot;central office&quot;,
of sorts. Eventually, each employee becomes responsible for the
same set of tasks, or job. At this point, the business is a form
of functional structure, with a central office overseeing various
major functions.</p>

<p>Note that the organization can, at any time, use more modern
designs even within the same overall organizational design. For
example, a self-managed team might be formed in a functional structure
to research new ideas for products and services.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1630835"></a></p>

<h2>Typical Structure of a Small, Incorporated Nonprofit Business
Organization</h2>

<p>NOTE: Although this section is labeled &quot;Nonprofit&quot;,
a small, incorporated for-profit business might be structured
similar to that described below. However, rather than having programs,
the for-profit business typically would have products or services.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following description is <i>not</i> meant to imply
that all new, incorporated, small for-profit organizations should
follow this typical structure. Also note that, as specified above,
not all nonprofits are incorporated, that is, have a board of
directors. The following description is of the typical small,
incorporated nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>To understand the structure of a typical, small, incorporated
nonprofit business organization, think of a picture with a box
at the top of the page. The box is labeled &quot;Board of Directors&quot;.
Directly under this box is a single box labeled &quot;Executive
Director (or Chief Executive Office, or President, etc.)&quot;.
Under this box is a row of boxes, each of which is labeled &quot;Program
1&quot;, &quot;Program 2&quot;, etc. Draw a line down from the
&quot;Board of Directors&quot; box to the &quot;Executive Director&quot;
box to show that the &quot;Executive Director&quot; reports to
the &quot;Board of Directors&quot;. Draw lines down from the &quot;Executive
Director&quot; box to each of the programs to show that the &quot;Executive
Director&quot; is responsible for overseeing the program.</p>

<p>As with for-profit organizations, nonprofits can, at any time,
use more modern designs even within the same overall organizational
design. For example, a self-managed team might be formed in a
functional structure to research new ideas for services to the
community.</p>
