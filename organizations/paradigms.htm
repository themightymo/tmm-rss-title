<h2>Driving Forces of Change</h2>

Around the 1960s and on to today, the environment of today's organizations
has changed a great deal. A variety of driving forces provoke
this change. Increasing telecommunications has &quot;shrunk&quot;
the world substantially. Increasing diversity of workers has brought
in a wide array of differing values, perspectives and expectations
among workers. Public consciousness has become much more sensitive
and demanding that organizations be more socially responsible.
Much of the third-world countries has joined the global marketplace,
creating a wider arena for sales and services. Organizations became
responsible not only to stockholders (those who owned stock) but
to a wider community of &quot;stakeholders.&quot;</p>

<p>As a result of the above driving forces,
organizations were required to adopt a &quot;new paradigm,&quot;
or view on the world, to be more sensitive, flexible and adaptable
to the demands and expectations of stakeholder demands. Many organizations
have abandoned or are abandoning the traditional top-down, rigid
and hierarchical structures to more &quot;organic&quot; and fluid
forms.
</p>

<p>Today's leaders and/or managers must
deal with continual, rapid change. Managers faced with a major
decision can no longer refer back to an earlier developed plan
for direction. Management techniques must continually notice changes
in the environment and organization, assess this change and manage
change. Managing change does not mean controlling it, rather understanding
it, adapting to it where necessary and guiding it when possible.
</p>

<p>Managers can't know it all or reference
resources for every situation. Managers must count on and listen
more to their employees. Consequently, new forms of organizations
are becoming more common, e.g., worker-centered teams, self-organizing
and self-designing teams, etc.

<h2>Traits of the New Paradigm</h2>

Marilyn Ferguson, in <i>The New Paradigm: Emerging Strategic for
Leadership and Organizational Change</i> (Michael Ray and Alan
Rinzler, Eds., 1993, New Consciousness Reader), provides a very
concise overview of the differences between the old and new paradigm.
(The following is summarized.)</p>
