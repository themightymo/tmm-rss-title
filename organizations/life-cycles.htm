<h2><a name="addl" id="addl"></a>What Are Organizational Life Cycles?</h2>
<p>Organizations go through different life-cycles just like people do. For example, 
  people go through infancy, child-hood and early-teenage phases that are characterized 
  by lots of rapid growth. People in these phases often do whatever it takes just 
  to stay alive, for example, eating, seeking shelter and sleeping. Often, these 
  people tend to make impulsive, highly reactive decisions based on whatever is 
  going on around them at the moment. Start-up organizations are like this, too. 
  Often, founders of the organization or program and its various members have 
  to do whatever is necessary just to stay in business. Leaders make highly reactive, 
  seat-of-the-pants decisions. They fear taking the time to slow down and do planning. 
</p>
<p>In our comparison of organizations and programs to people,
we note that, as people continue to mature, they begin to understand
more about the world and themselves. Over time, they develop a
certain kind of wisdom that sees them through many of the challenges
in life and work. They learn to plan and to use a certain amount
of discipline to carry through on those plans. They learn to manage
themselves. To survive well into the future, organizations and
programs must be able to do this, as well. Experienced leaders
have learned to recognize the particular life cycle that an organization
or program is going through. These leaders understand the types
of problems faced by the organization or program during the life
cycle. That understanding gives them a sense of perspective and
helps them to decide how to respond to decisions and problems
in the workplace. </p>

<h2>Organizational Life Cycles and Corresponding Typical Features</h2>

Organizations, as with most
systems, go through life-cycles. Features of new organizations
are usually markedly different from older (usually more larger)
organizations. The following very useful table was summarized
Richard L. Daft's work and book, <i>Organizational Theory and
Design</i> (West Publishing, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1992), which,
in turn, based information from Robert E. Quinn and Kim Cameron's
<i>Organizational Life Cycles and Some Shifting Criteria of Effectiveness,</i>
Management Science, 29, (1983), pp. 31-51. Also see

<h3>Another Perspective</h3>
<p> In the book, <i>5 Life Stages of Nonprofit Organizations</i> (Wilder Foundation, 
  2001), the author, Judith Sharken Simon, provides another perspective on life 
  cycles of nonprofit organizations. She identifies:<br />
  1. Stage One: Imagine and Inspire (&quot;Can the dream be realized?&quot;)<br />
  2. Stage Two: Found and Frame (&quot;How are we going to pull this off?&quot;)<br />
  3. Stage Three: Ground and Grow (&quot;How can we build this to be viable?&quot;)<br />
  4. Stage Four: Produce and Sustain (&quot;How can the momentum be sustained?&quot;)<br />
  5. Stage Five: Review and Renew (&quot;What do we need to redesign?&quot;)</p>
<h2><a name="styles" id="styles"></a>Organizational Life-Cycles and Management 
  Styles</h2>
<!--[index|Organizational Development]-->
Based on the book &quot;Barbarians to Bureaucrats&quot; <br />
by Lawrence Miller, published by C.N. Potter: New York. <br />
Edited by <a href="http://www.authenticityconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Carter 
McNamara, MBA, PhD</a>
<p>In this very enlightening book, Miller suggests there is a strong relationship 
  between the life-cycle stage of an organization and the nature of its leadership. 
  He asserts this evolutionary life-cycle is typical to cultures as well as organizations. 
  His work shows powerful insights to the nature of organizations and their management 
  and matches the experiences of many practitioners. His work can be referenced 
  to explain much of the wide variation in management styles, yet close association 
  between styles of management and stages of an organization's life. <br />
  <br />
  Miller suggests that the life of an organization is similar to the shape of 
  a bell curve, that is, the organization experiences a rise of health, it peaks, 
  and then gradually declines. The life-cycle stages of Prophet, Barbarian, Builder, 
  Explorer stages are on the way up the curve of health, the Synergist is at the 
  peak, and the Administrator, Bureaucrat, and Aristocrat stages are on the way 
  back down the curve of health. </p>

<b>Synergist:</b> Miller says a synergist is &quot;... a leader who has escaped 
his or her own conditioned tendencies toward one style and incorporated, appreciated 
and unified each of the styles of leadership on the life-cycle curve. The best 
managed companies are synergistic.&quot; Miller asserts that the synergist is 
a synergy of the other management styles, and therefore, is best described by 
a set of principles. <br />
1. <b><i>Spirit</i></b> - Corporations are both spiritual and material in nature. 
In their youth, they possess spiritual rather than material assets. In decline, 
this is reverse. Health is maintained by unifying the spiritual and material assets. 
<br />
2. <b><i>Purpose</i></b> - The purpose of the business organization is to create 
real wealth by serving its [stakeholder!]. It is a function of leadership to instill 
and reinforce social purpose. <br />
3. <b><i>Creativity</i></b> - The first and most important act of business is 
the creative act: the creation of new and improve products, services, selling 
and means of production. Change, youthfulness and energy are requirements until 
death. (Those who lean toward creativity will be required to sacrifice for the 
sake of administrative sanity.) <br />
4. <b><i>Challenge and response</i></b> - The task of leaders is to create or 
recognize the current challenge, respond creatively, and avoid a condition of 
ease. Reliance on yesterday's successful response in the face of new challenges 
leads to decline. (It is an irony of life that satisfaction and security are the 
enemies of excellence.) <br />
5. <b><i>Planned urgency</i></b> - The urgency to decide and act promptly leads 
to expansion and advance. Prompt action must be balanced by deliberate planning. 
There will always be conflict between promptness and planning. <br />
6. <b><i>Unity and diversity</i></b> - Advancing cultures are socially unifying 
and become diverse in character. Leaders must act to unify diverse talents and 
traits. Leaders must actively resist the tendency to attract and promote like 
personalities and skills. <br />
7. <b><i>Specialized competence</i></b> - Specialized knowledge and skills and 
the integration of those competencies must be pursued vigorously. Efficient methods 
are derived from specialized competence; however, specialized competence leads 
to inefficient methods. <br />
8. <b><i>Efficient administration</i></b> - Efficient administration is required 
to achieve integration and performance as differentiation increases. Unchecked 
administration inevitably leads to bureaucracy and the decline of creativity and 
wealth creation. <br />
9. <b><i>On-the-Spot Decisions</i></b> - Decisions should be made by those on-the-spot, 
close to the customer, product or service. The further decisions are removed from 
the point of action and knowledge, the worse the quality and the higher the cost. 
Consensus is a sign of maturity and health.
