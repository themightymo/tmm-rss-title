<h2>Characteristics
of New Nature of Organizations</h2>

New forms of organizations are geared to make organizations more
receptive, adaptive and generative -- always focused on meeting
the needs of stakeholders. New forms of organizations often exhibit
the following characteristics:</p>

<p>1. <b>Strong employee involvement</b>
- input to the system starts from those closest
to the outcome preferred by the system, from those most in-the-know
about whether the organization is achieving its preferred outcomes
with its stakeholders or not. This way, the organization stays
highly attuned and adaptive to the needs of stakeholders.</p>

<p>2. <b>Organic in nature</b>
- less rules and regulations, sometimes no clear boundaries and
always-changing forms</p>

<p>3. <b>Authority based on capability</b>
- ensures the organization remains a means to an end and not an
end in itself</p>

<p>4. <b>Alliances</b> -takes advantage of economies of scale, e.g., collaborations,
networks, strategic alliances/mergers, etc.</p>

<p>5. <b>Teams</b> -shares
activities to take advantage of economies of scale at the lowest
levels of activities and ensures full involvement of employees
at the lowest levels</p>

<p>6. <b>Flatter, decentralized organizations</b>
- less middle management, resulting in top management exchanging
more feedback with those providing products and services; also
results in less overhead costs</p>

<p>7. <b>Mindfulness of environments,
changes, patterns and themes</b> - priority on reflection
and inquiry to learn from experience; develop &quot;learning organizations&quot;
<br />

<h2>New
Organizational Structures</h2>
<h3>Network Structure</h3>
This modern structure
includes the linking of numerous, separate organizations to optimize
their interaction in order to accomplish a common, overall goal.
An example is a joint venture to build a complex, technical systems
such as the space shuttle. Another example is a network of construction
companies to build a large structure.
</p>

<h3>Virtual Organization</h3>
<p>
This emerging form is
based on organization members interacting with each other completely,
or almost completely, via telecommunications. Members may never
actually meet each other. See <br />
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/groups/virtual/toolkit.htm">Virtual Teams</a></p>

<h3>Self-Managed Teams</h3>
<p>
These teams usually include from 5-15 people and are geared to
produce a product or service. Members provide a range of the skills
needed to produce the product. The team is granted sufficient
authority and access to resources to produce their product in
a timely fashion. The hallmark of a self-managed team is that
members indeed manage their own group, i.e., they manage access
to resources, scheduling, supervision, etc. Team members develop
their own process for identifying and rotating members in managerial
roles. Often, authority at any given time rests with whomever
has the most expertise about the current activity or task in the
overall project. Often members are trained in various problem-solving
techniques and team-building techniques. These teams work best
in environments where the technologies to deliver the product
or service are highly complex and the marketplace and organization
environments are continually changing. Self-managed teams pose
a unique challenge for the traditional manager. It can be extremely
difficult for him or her to support empowerment of the self-managed
team, taking the risk of letting go of his or her own control.</p>

<h3>Learning Organizations 
</h3>
<p>

In an environment where environments are continually changing,
it's critical that organizations detect and quickly correct its
own errors. This requires continuous feedback to, and within,
the organization. Continual feedback allows the organization to
`unlearn' old beliefs and remain open to new feedback, uncolored
by long-held beliefs.</p>

<p>In a learning organization, managers
don't direct as much as they facilitate the workers' applying
new information and learning from that experience. Managers ensure
time to exchange feedback, to inquire and reflect about the feedback,
and then to gain consensus on direction. Peter Senge, noted systems
theorist, points out in his book, <i>The Fifth Discipline</i>
(Doubleday, 1990, p. 14), that the learning organization is &quot;continually
expanding its capacity to create its future ... for a learning
organization, `adaptive learning' must be joined by `generative
learning,' learning that enhances our capacity to create.&quot;</p>

<h3>Self-Organizing Systems
</h3>
<p>
Self-organizing systems have the ability to continually change
their structure and internal processes to conform to feedback
with the environment. Some writers use the analogy of biological
systems as self-organizing systems. Their ultimate purpose is
to stay alive and duplicate. They exist in increasing complexity
and adapt their structures and forms to accommodate this complexity.
Ultimately, they change structure dramatically to adjust to the
outer environment. (Some assert that self-managed groups are self-organizing
systems, although others assert that self-managed groups are not
because an ultimate purpose is assigned to team members).</p>

<p>A self-organizing system requires
a strong current goal or purpose. It requires continual feedback
with its surrounding environment. It requires continual reference
to a common set of values and dialoguing around these values.
It requires continued and shared reflection around the system's
current processes. The manager of this type of organization requires
high value on communication and a great deal of patience -- and
the ability to focus on outcomes rather than outputs. Focus is
more on learning than on method.
