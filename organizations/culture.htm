<h2>What is Culture?</h2>

<p>Basically, organizational culture is the personality of the
organization. Culture is comprised of the assumptions, values,
norms and tangible signs (artifacts) of organization members and
their behaviors. Members of an organization soon come to sense
the particular culture of an organization. Culture is one of those
terms that's difficult to express distinctly, but everyone knows
it when they sense it. For example, the culture of a large, for-profit
corporation is quite different than that of a hospital which is
quite different than that of a university. You can tell the culture
of an organization by looking at the arrangement of furniture,
what they brag about, what members wear, etc. -- similar to what
you can use to get a feeling about someone's personality.</p>

<p>Corporate culture can be looked at as a system. Inputs include
feedback from, e.g., society, professions, laws, stories, heroes,
values on competition or service, etc. The process is based on
our assumptions, values and norms, e.g., our values on money,
time, facilities, space and people. Outputs or effects of our
culture are, e.g., organizational behaviors, technologies, strategies,
image, products, services, appearance, etc.</p>

<p>The concept of culture is particularly important when attempting
to manage organization-wide change. Practitioners are coming to
realize that, despite the best-laid plans, organizational change
must include not only changing structures and processes, but also
changing the corporate culture as well.</p>

<p>There's been a great deal of literature generated over the
past decade about the concept of organizational culture -- particularly
in regard to learning how to change organizational culture. Organizational
change efforts are rumored to fail the vast majority of the time.
Usually, this failure is credited to lack of understanding about
the strong role of culture and the role it plays in organizations.
That's one of the reasons that many strategic planners now place
as much emphasis on identifying strategic values as they do mission
and vision.</p>

<h2>Some Types of Culture</h2>

<p>There are different types of culture just like there are different
types of personality. Researcher Jeffrey Sonnenfeld identified
the following four types of cultures.</p>

<h3>Academy Culture</h3>

<p>Employees are highly skilled and tend to stay in the organization,
while working their way up the ranks. The organization provides
a stable environment in which employees can development and exercise
their skills. Examples are universities, hospitals, large corporations,
etc.</p>

<h3>Baseball Team Culture</h3>

<p>Employees are &quot;free agents&quot; who have highly prized
skills. They are in high demand and can rather easily get jobs
elsewhere. This type of culture exists in fast-paced, high-risk
organizations, such as investment banking, advertising, etc.</p>

<h3>Club Culture</h3>

<p>The most important requirement for employees in this culture
is to fit into the group. Usually employees start at the bottom
and stay with the organization. The organization promotes from
within and highly values seniority. Examples are the military,
some law firms, etc.</p>

<h3>Fortress Culture</h3>

<p>Employees don't know if they'll be laid off or not. These organizations often 
  undergo massive reorganization. There are many opportunities for those with 
  timely, specialized skills. Examples are savings and loans, large car companies, 
  etc.</p>
<h2><a name="assess" id="assess"></a>Understanding the Culture of Your Organization</h2>
<p>Quite often, a leader has a very good sense of the culture of their organization. 
  They just haven&#8217;t made that sense conscious to the extent that they can 
  effectively learn from, and lead within, the culture. </p>
<p>Different people in the same organization can have different perceptions of 
  the culture of the organization. This is especially true regarding the different 
  perceptions between the top and bottom levels of the organization. For example, 
  the Chief Executive may view the organization as being highly focused, well 
  organized and even rather formal. On the other hand, the receptionist might 
  view the organization as being confused, disorganized and, sometimes, even rude.</p>
<p>Here are some basic guidelines to help a leader assess the culture of their 
  organization.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand some of the major types of cultures. There are a number of research 
    efforts that have produced lists of different types of culture. You can start 
    by reviewing the very short list in the previous subsection, Major Types of 
    Cultures.</li>
  <li>Describe the culture of your organization. Consider what you see and hear, 
    not what you feel and think. Answer the following questions. <br />
    a. Who seems to be accepted and who doesn&#8217;t? What is it about those 
    who are accepted as compared to those who aren&#8217;t?<br />
    b. What kinds of behaviors get rewarded? For example, getting along? Getting 
    things done? Other behaviors?<br />
    c. What does management pay the most attention to? For example, problems? 
    Successes? Crises? Other behaviors?<br />
    d. How are decisions made? For example, by one person? Discussion and consensus? 
    Are decisions made at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that there may not be close alignment between what the organization says 
  it values (for example, creativity, innovation, team-building) as compared to 
  what you&#8217;re actually seeing (for example, conformity, individualism). 
  This disparity is rather common in organizations. You might explain this disparity 
  to other leaders in the organization. An ideal time to address this disparity 
  is when developing a values statement during the strategic planning process. 
</p>
<h2><a name="influence" id="influence"></a>Changing Culture of an Organization</h2>
<p>There are four primary ways to influence the culture of an organization.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Emphasize what&#8217;s important. This includes widely communicating goals 
    of the organization, posting the mission statement on the wall, talking about 
    accomplishments and repeating what you want to see in the workplace. </li>
  <li>Reward employees whose behaviors reflect what&#8217;s important. </li>
  <li>Discourage behaviors that don&#8217;t reflect what&#8217;s important. There 
    is no need to punish or cause prolonged discomfort. Rather, you want to dissuade 
    the employee from continuing unwanted behaviors by giving them constructive 
    feedback, verbal warnings, written warnings, or firing them. </li>
  <li>Model the behaviors that you want to see in the workplace. This is perhaps 
    the most powerful way to influence behaviors in the workplace. For example, 
    if you want to see more teamwork among your employees, then involve yourself 
    in teams more often. </li>
