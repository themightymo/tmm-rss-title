of social networking, including basics about each of the most

<h2>Major Social Networking Tools</h2>

<a name="anchor1928"></a>
<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>A blog is an online journal of information about a certain
topic. The blogger, or owner of the blog, writes or publishes
regular &quot;posts,&quot; or articles, about the topic. Posts
vary in size from 100 words to 1,000 depending on the nature of
the topic. The posts might be published once a month or even once
a day, depending on the blogger's time and energy for the blog.</p>

<p>A blog is a powerful means for the blogger to establish relationships
with stakeholders by sharing his/her opinions and expertise on
a regular basis. Stakeholders could include, e.g., customers,
investors, employees, community leaders, collaborators and suppliers.
The stakeholders read the blog posts to learn more about the topic
and even more about the blogger.</p>

<h3>LinkedIn</h3>

<p>LinkedIn is sometimes described as a &quot;social networking
service for adults&quot;. It's a very useful tool for quickly
informing people about your professional experiences, skills and
interests. You also can use LinkedIn to conveniently network with
others who have similar backgrounds and interests. Compare LinkedIn
to Facebook, below, which tends to be about more informal topics,
such as personal background, interests, family, hobbies, friends,
etc.<br />

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>People can join Facebook to share information about themselves
or their organization. Information about themselves tends to be
rather informal -- more so than LinkedIn. Organizations increasingly
use Facebook as a public relations tool, to inform the public
about the organization.<br />

<h3>MySpace</h3>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>Twitter is a social networking site that allows the author
to quickly share messages, or tweets, of up to 140 characters
and with huge numbers of people. While 140 characters might seem
quite limiting, an increasing number of people and organizations
use Twitter to share opinions and even to advertise products and
services. Some news organizations use Twitter to quickly broadcast
up-to-the-minute news items.<br />

<h3>Build Your Social Media Plan Right &#8211; From Scratch</h3>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/marketing/contacting-lisa-chapman/" target="_blank">Lisa 
  Chapman</a></p>
<h4>How to Reach Your Target Audience</h4>
<p>In addition to your primary site, social media sites leverage your messages 
  online. The wonder of social media is that it naturally connects people who 
  have similar interests. You want to reach your friends, and your friends&#8217; 
  friends.</p>
<p>When you engage in discussions online through social media, your message can 
  even &#8220;go viral&#8221;, gaining momentum and reaching well beyond your 
  friends&#8217; friends. The ultimate goal of an internet marketing campaign 
  is to create a meaningful message that reaches its target audience and is virally 
  spread to others who are interested in the topic. </p>
<h4>Social Media Plan Fundamentals</h4>
<p>Build your social media presence and interaction very deliberately. Certain 
  basic fundamentals will make your social media efforts most rewarding:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write down your business goals.</li>
  <li>Find and listen to the conversations that are already taking place online 
    about you, your products, your competitors, and your competitors&#8217; products.</li>
  <li>Find and listen to your ideal customers&#8217; needs. Remember, when you 
    offer a solution that solves a pressing problem, fulfills an urgent need, 
    or gives them hope and joy, people will eagerly buy it.</li>
  <li>Choose key social media sites for your target niche and establish your online 
    profile.</li>
  <li>Integrate those sites for maximum exposure, brand-building, and traffic.</li>
  <li>Engage in conversations.</li>
  <li>Build your network or following. Build your email database.</li>
  <li>Track and monitor activity and results.</li>
  <li>Tweak to continually improve results.</li>
  <li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Listen, Engage, Add Valuable Content</h4>
<p>A site that allows users to interact and add content (comments, links, photos, 
  video, etc.) is social. Use first person. Make your interaction sound and feel 
  genuine. The people you meet online will be attracted to you (and what you offer) 
  when you add helpful, meaningful input. If you&#8217;re new to social media, 
  it is widely recommended that you first LISTEN to the conversation in order 
  to become familiar with its unique style and flow.</p>

<h4>Simple Steps will Integrate Social Media into Your Traditional Marketing Plan</h4>
<p>As a marketing and small business consultant (www.LisaChapman.com and social 
  media consultant (www.iBrandMasters.com), I am continually astounded at how 
  SLOW small business managers really are in understanding, budgeting, and integrating 
  online marketing into their traditional marketing plans. Lots of lip service, 
  very little action.</p>
<p>I realize that this is old news, but if this post motivates even a just handful 
  of small businesses to actually START their trek into online marketing, I will 
  be thrilled.</p>
<p>For those of you who have already started &#8211; congratulations, and please 
  read this in the spirit of checking yourself. Have you covered the basics?</p>
<h4>Why is Social Media Marketing Important?</h4>
<p>Traditional marketing has changed and will never be the same.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Technology allows consumers to mute or skip TV commercials &#8211; and 
    they do.</li>
  <li>Newspaper and all print circulation is dying. Ads do not get our attention.</li>
  <li>One-way &#8220;push&#8221; messaging is now viewed as offensive and hype-ish. 
    Bad for the brand.</li>
  <li>Consumers are overwhelmingly &#8216;over-messaged&#8217;. We are all OVERLOADED.</li>
  <li>Consumers do not trust traditional marketers anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consumers Demand More Attention</h4>
<p>Online, consumers have a voice. If a company&#8217;s product or service doesn&#8217;t 
  match their marketing claims, WATCH OUT! Disgruntled and disenchanted consumers 
  now have the power to publish all of their harsh and unedited opinions &#8211; 
  anytime they want to! Once published online, those messages are likely permanent, 
  and business has no control over the backlash.</p>
<p>Consumers want and demand that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Their voice be heard and ACKNOWLEDGED.</li>
  <li>Companies be accountable for mismatched promises and actions.</li>
  <li>Their peers be involved in the most powerful &#8216;word-of-mouth&#8217; 
    ever.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Business Can Take Action and Benefit Enormously</h4>
<p>Think of it like this: social networks are actually a democratic form of business! 
  Customers vote with their opinions. Business has a gigantic opportunity to directly 
  impact their customers online, engage them, and develop a real relationship 
  of TRUST that will be stronger and longer-lived.</p>
<p>Businesses of all sizes MUST adopt and USE a social networking and social media 
  marketing strategies NOW &#8211; or risk being left in the dust.</p>

  Chapman</a></p>
<h4>Integrate Social Media Marketing &#8211; Brand Advocates</h4>
<p>When companies engage their audience and develop online relationships with 
  real authenticity and trust, they have an exciting opportunity to make those 
  individuals volunteer advocates of their brand!</p>
<p>Business has never had a bigger vehicle for positive word-of-mouth advertising. 
  Fun campaigns can go &#8216;viral&#8217; and trigger momentum like never before. 
  This takes some strategic planning by management, and some genuine understanding 
  of social networks. It&#8217;s a new culture that MUST be embraced by the entire 
  organization, from the top down.</p>
<h4>7 Steps to Start Strategizing &#8211; Target and Engage Your Online Audience</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Gather together a company team to strategize social media marketing. Include 
    a cross-section of top management, sales, marketing, customer service, and 
    a knowledgeable social media marketing individual (bring in a consultant if 
    you don&#8217;t have this expertise on staff.)</li>
  <li>Convene this group for a minimum of four hours. Bring the current marketing 
    plan. Ask everyone, &#8220;Does our (product or service) delivery match our 
    marketing message?&#8221; If not, STOP. You must solve these problems before 
    you can mount a successful social media marketing strategy/plan/campaign.</li>
  <li>Discuss and decide on your marketing and advertising goals. Do your current 
    marketing and advertising efforts achieve them? If so, challenge the team 
    to set higher goals, and brainstorm ways that social media marketing can be 
    implemented.</li>
  <li>Identify online communities where your ideal customer congregates or searches. 
    For example, if you are a local business, Google: &#8220;(your city) directories&#8221; 
    to find local directories in which you should be listed.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you have searched and settled on specific keywords and keyword 
    phrases that you use consistently in all of your online content.</li>
  <li>Establish 2-6 online &#8220;properties&#8221; (all optimized for your keywords) 
    such as; at least one website, blog, social network site, and directory. The 
    more places you exist online, the greater your chances of being found!</li>
  <li>Brainstorm online campaigns that help you achieve your goals. Remember, 
    social media is effective ONLY if you have an end in mind. Otherwise, it&#8217;s 
    fun, but can be a waste of time and precious resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hundreds of creative possibilities exist, depending on your time, budget and 
  goals. Have fun with this!</p>

<h2>Social Networking Policies</h2>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href="http://managementhelp.org/blogs/marketing/contacting-lisa-chapman/" target="_blank">Lisa 
  Chapman</a></p>
<p>Blogs, comments and social network postings are very important in businesses&#8217; 
  marketing tactics. They attract audiences and begin to build relationships of 
  trust and engagement. But employee posts can also inadvertently cause PR nightmares 
  for business, if even ONE errant post goes viral and causes negative word of 
  mouth.</p>
<h4>Legal Risks of Employees&#8217; Social Media Use</h4>
<p>When using social media, companies are exposed to many serious risks from multiple 
  angles, including:</p>
<p> Defamation<br />
  Copyright<br />
  Anti-trust issues<br />
  Inappropriate use by staff<br />
  Intellectual property rights<br />
  User generated content <br />
  Employment practices</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your marketing and communications teams run ahead without due 
  diligence and risk management controls.</p>
<h4>EXAMPLE Social Media Policies</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at a few companies&#8217; policies and guidelines 
  on employee use of social networking. The policy excerpts below offer highlights 
  of their own in-house guidelines:</p>
<p><strong><em>Yahoo&#8217;s Blog Policies &#8211; Belief Statement</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Yahoo! believes in fostering a thriving online community and supports 
  blogging as a valuable component of shared media.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Mayo Clinic&#8217;s Employee Social Media Policy</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing Mayo employees need to remember about blogs and social 
  networking sites is that the same basic policies apply in these spaces as in 
  other areas of their lives. The purpose of these guidelines is to help employees 
  understand how Mayo policies apply to these newer technologies for communication, 
  so you can participate with confidence not only on this blog, but in other social 
  media platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>City of Seattle</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To address the fast-changing landscape of the Internet and the way residents 
  communicate and obtain information online, City of Seattle departments may consider 
  using social media tools to reach a broader audience. The City encourages the 
  use of social media to further the goals of the City and the missions of its 
  departments, where appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many companies are quite explicit, with well-defined, formal rules. Others 
  adopt a more open, lenient culture.</p>
