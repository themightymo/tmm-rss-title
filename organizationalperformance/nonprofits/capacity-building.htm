<p>Capacity building has fast become a major topic among nonprofits
and management support organizations (funders, associations, training
centers, consultants, etc.) that provide services to nonprofits.
There are a variety of definitions for capacity building. Perhaps
the most fundamental definition is &quot;actions that improve
nonprofit effectiveness&quot; (from <i>Investing in Capacity Building</i>
by Barbara Blumenthal, published by The Foundation Center). Some
other discussions about capacity building refer to the concept
as actions that enhance a nonprofit's ability to work towards
its mission.</p>

<p>The concept of capacity building in nonprofits is similar to
the concept of organizational development, organizational effectiveness
and/or organizational performance management in for-profits. Capacity
building efforts can include a broad range of approaches, eg,
granting operating funds, granting management development funds,
providing training and development sessions, providing coaching,
supporting collaboration with other nonprofits, etc. Prominent
methods of organizational performance management in for-profits
are beginning to be mentioned in discussions about capacity building,
as well, for example, the Balanced Scorecard, principles of organizational
change, cultural change, organizational learning, etc.</p>

<p>Information in this topic of the Library will acquaint you
with the concept of capacity building in nonprofits, including
offering you a broad background from some suggested previous readings,
numerous perspectives on capacity building from numerous articles,
and then review of various common functions in nonprofits (eg,
boards, role of CEO, programs, marketing, fundraising, finances,
evaluation, etc.). The topic closes with review of major methods
of organizational performance management.</p>

started to meet, then it should shut down -- or &quot;sunsetted.&quot;<br />
