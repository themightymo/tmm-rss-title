<h2>Description</h2>
<p>

The following checklist is a resource developed by
staff and volunteers of the United Way of Minneapolis Area for
internal use by nonprofit organizations. Management can use the
checklist to identify their organization's administrative strengths
and weaknesses. United Way staff and community volunteers intend
this to strengthen their administrative capabilities. It is believed
that widespread use of the checklist ultimately results in a more
effective and efficient nonprofit community. The checklist is
not intended to be used as a tool for external evaluation, or
by grantmakers in making funding decisions. This tool will be
used to assist nonprofit organizations to gain a better understanding
of their management needs and/or make improvements to management
operations.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>

The checklist indicators represent what is needed to have a healthy,
well-managed organization. Since it is a self-assessment tool,
organizations should evaluate themselves honestly against each
issue and use the response to change or strengthen its administrative
operations.</p>

<h3>Ratings:</h3>
<p>
Each indicator is rated based on its importance to the operation
and effectiveness of any nonprofit organization. The ratings are:<br />
<b><i>E:</i></b> Indicators with an &quot;E&quot; are essential
or basic requirements to the operations of <i>all</i> nonprofit
organizations. Organizations which do not meet the requirements
of these indicators could place their organizations in jeopardy.
<br />
<b><i>R:</i></b> An &quot;R&quot; rating signifies that these
indicators are recommended as standard practice for effective
nonprofit organizations.<br />
<b><i>A:</i></b> Additional indicators which organizations can
implement to enhance and strengthen their management operations
and activities are rated with an &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<h3>Checklist Responses:</h3>
<p>
Organizations can respond in one of three ways to each indicators
used:<br />
1. <b><i>Needs work -</i></b> An indicator that is marked as &quot;Needs
Work&quot; implies that work has been done towards achieving this
goal. The organization is aware of the need for this indicator,
and is working towards attaining it.<br />
2. <b><i>Met -</i></b> All indicators marked as &quot;Met&quot;
demonstrate that the organization has fulfilled as essential management
need. However, the organization should review these indicators
in the future to be sure that their management remains healthy
in view of the many internal and external changes which constantly
occur in all organizations.<br />
3. <b><i>N/A -</i></b> Indicators marked as &quot;N/A&quot; can
mean several things, including:<br />
- the indicator is not applicable to the management operations
of this organization<br />
- the organization is not sure of the need to meet the requirements
of this indicator<br />
- the organization has not met, nor is working on this indicator
presently, but may address it in the future</p>

<p><b>All organizations should take note:</b> All responses to
indicators should be reviewed carefully to see if they could improve
management operations. Indicators checked &quot;N/A&quot; due
to uncertain applicability to the organization must be further
reviewed to determine if they should become a part of &quot;doing
business.&quot; If the assessors simply do not know what the indicator
means, further information may be needed to accurately assess
the feasibility of its application. Indicators marked &quot;N/A&quot;
because they have not been met but that apply to the organization,
may require immediate attention. Technical assistance, consulting,
or training may be required to implement these indicators.</p>

<p>The indicators in this checklist should be informative and
thought provoking. The checklist can be used to achieve not only
a beginning level of good management, but improve existing management
to provide the organization with greater stability, reliability
and success in the nonprofit community. It is also a useful too
if an organization is experiencing management problems, to help
pinpoint any weaknesses so action can be taken or assistance sought
to improve the organization's health. All organizations should
use the checklist to re-assess themselves periodically to ensure
compliance with established rules and regulations, and to continue
improving administrative health through the indicator's helpful
suggestions.</p>
