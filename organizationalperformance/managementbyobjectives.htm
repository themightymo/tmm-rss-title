<h1>Management by Objectives (MBO)</h1>

<!--[index|Management]-->

<p>This method aims to identify and closely align organizational goals and subordinate 
  objectives throughout the organization. Ideally, employees get strong input 
  to identify their own goals and objectives. It includes extensive, ongoing tracking 
  and feedback in the processes to reach objectives. Similar to continuous improvement, 
  many organizations already implement some version of MBO, but probably not to 
  the extent that experts in MBO would recognize as MBO in the organizations.
