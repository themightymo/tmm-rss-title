<p>We're used to thinking of ongoing performance management for
employees, for example, setting goals, monitoring an employee's
achievement of those goals, sharing feedback with the employee,
evaluating the employee's performance, rewarding the employee's
performance or firing the employee. However, performance management
applies to teams and organizations, as well. Organizational performance
involves the recurring activities to establish organizational
goals, monitor progress toward the goals, and make adjustments
to achieve those goals more effectively and efficiently. Those
recurring activities are much of what leaders and managers inherently
do in their organizations -- some of them do it far better than
others. (It's useful to think of organizational change in the
context of organizational performance, rather than change for
the sake of change, so the topic of <a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalchange/index.htm"
class="textlink">Organizational Change</a> will be useful to the
reader, as well.)</p>

<h2>Identifying What to Improve in Organizations -- Using Organizational
Assessments</h2>

<p>When seeking to improve the performance of an organization,
it's very helpful to regularly conduct assessments of the current
performance of the organization. Assessments might be planned,
systematic and explicit (these often are the best kinds of assessments)
or unplanned and implicit. Well-done assessments typically use
tools, such as comprehensive questionnaires, SWOT analyses, diagnostic
models (we often use these models without recognizing or referring
to them as such), etc., along with comparison of results to various
&quot;best practices&quot; or industry standards. The following
tools might be useful to you.</p>

<h2>Interpreting Results of Assessments -- Using Organizational Diagnostic Models</h2>

<p>Once you've conducted assessments of your organization, whether
explicitly or implicitly, it helps to have some basis by which
to analyze the results. Diagnostic models can provide that basis.
There are differing opinions about diagnostic models. Some people
suggest that these models should come without bias or suggested
solutions, and should be used to accomplish an objective, unfolding
understanding of organizations. Others believe that models should
suggest:<br />
1. What types of practices should be occurring in the organization.<br />
2. The order in which those practices should be occurring.<br />
3. Standards of performance for various domains, such as individual
positions, teams, projects, processes, functions, programs and
the organization.<br />
Thus, a diagnostic model can be useful in an organizational change
effort to:<br />
1. Analyze results of data collection.<br />
2. Identify issues that should be addressed by the organizational
change effort.<br />
3. Suggest what actions should be taken to address the issues.<br />
4. Evaluate the success of the organizational change effort.<br />
There are numerous organizational diagnostic models available,
depending on one's beliefs on what the roles of the models should
be. Below are two examples. (NOTE: Many of the systems mentioned
later on below can be used as diagnostic tools.)<br />

<h2><a name="system" id="system"></a>Systematic Methods to Address Assessment 
  Results (Organizational Performance Management Systems)</h2>
<h3>What's an Organizational Performance System?</h3>
<p>Any or all of the approaches listed later on below will improve organizational 
  performance depending on if they are implemented comprehensively and remain 
  focused on organizational results. Each includes regular recurring activities 
  to establish organizational goals, monitor progress toward the goals, and make 
  adjustments to achieve those goals more effectively and efficiently. Typically, 
  these become integrated into the overall recurring management systems in the 
  organization (as opposed to being used primarily in one-time projects for change 
  -- see <a href="#anchor125028" class="textlink">Organizational Change and Development 
  to Improve Performance</a> later on below). </p>
<p>Some of the following, e.g., organizational learning and knowledge management, 
  might be interpreted more as movements than organization performance strategies 
  because there are wide interpretations of the concepts, not all of which include 
  focusing on achieving top-level organizational results. However, if these two 
  concepts are instilled across the organization and focus on organizational results, 
  they contribute strongly to organizational performance. On the other hand, the 
  Balanced Scorecard, which is deliberately designed to be comprehensive and focused 
  on organizational results, will not improve performance if not implemented from 
  a strong design. </p>
<p>For example, a large organization with highly standardized processes (such 
  as a manufacturing company with assembly lines) can carry out numerous and ongoing 
  measurements in a straightforward fashion. It also has extensive resources to 
  conduct the measurements and analyze results. ISO9000 certification is a strong 
  enhancement to a company's image. Therefore, the organization might pursue ISO9000 
  certification, including through use of continuous improvements in an overall 
  Total Quality Management approach. The organization may establish numerous benchmarks 
  for comparison to other organizations in the industry to get perspective on 
  how well the organization is doing, what results to pursue, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a risk management company specializing in consultation to 
  protect against terrorism, has a bigger challenge to identify and track performance 
  results. Management might believe, for example, that the organization's means 
  for delivery of services are well out-of-date and that the organization is no 
  longer resourced to advise organizations about increasing threats from terrorism 
  that exist today. Therefore, the risk management company may choose to use business 
  process reengineering to completely redesign their organization from the ground 
  up.</p>
<h3>Prominent Organizational Performance Improvement Models (Systems)</h3>
<p>The following descriptions are general and brief. Follow the link to get more 
  information about each of the approaches. There certainly are other approaches 
  than those listed below for a planned, comprehensive approach to increasing 
  organizational performance. It may very well be that the vast majority of approaches 
  used in organizations are highly customized to the nature of the organizations, 
  and therefore not publicized or formalized in management literature.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/balanced-scorecard.htm">Balanced
Scorecard</a>: Focuses on four indicators, including customer
perspective, internal-business processes, learning and growth
and financials, to monitor progress toward organization's strategic
goals</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/benchmarking.htm">Benchmarking</a>:
Using standard measurements in a service or industry for comparison
to other organizations in order to gain perspective on organizational
performance. For example, there are emerging standard benchmarks
for universities, hospitals, etc. In and of itself, this is not
an overall comprehensive process assured to improve performance,
rather the results from benchmark comparisons can be used in more
overall processes. Benchmarking is often perceived as a quality
initiative.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/reengineering.htm">Business
Process Reengineering</a>: Aims to increase performance by radically
re-designing the organization's structures and processes, including
by starting over from the ground up.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/continuous-improvement.htm">Continuous
Improvement</a>: Focuses on improving customer satisfaction through
continuous and incremental improvements to processes, including
by removing unnecessary activities and variations. Continuous
improvement is often perceived as a quality initiative.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalchange/index.htm">Cultural
Change:</a> Cultural change is a form of organizational transformation,
that is, radical and fundamental form of change. Cultural change
involves changing the basic values, norms, beliefs, etc., among
members of the organization.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/iso9000.htm">ISO9000</a>:
Is an internationally recognized standard of quality, and includes
guidelines to accomplish the ISO9000 standard. Organizations can
be optionally audited to earn ISO9000 certification. Another major
quality standard is the <a href="http://www.quality.nist.gov/"
target="_blank" class="textlink">Baldridge Award</a>. ISO9000
is a quality initiative.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/knowledge-management.htm">Knowledge
Management</a>: Focuses on collection and management of critical
knowledge in an organization to increase its capacity for achieving
results. Knowledge management often includes extensive use of
computer technology. In and of itself, this is not an overall
comprehensive process assured to improve performance. Its effectiveness
toward reaching overall results for the organization depends on
how well the enhanced, critical knowledge is applied in the organization.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/organizational-learning.htm">Learning
Organization</a>: Focuses on enhancing organizations systems (including
people) to increase an organization's capacity for performance.
Includes extensive use of principles of systems theory. In and
of itself, this is not an overall comprehensive process assured
to improve performance. Its effectiveness toward reaching overall
results for the organization depends on how well the enhanced
ability to learn is applied in the organization.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizationalperformance/managementbyobjectives.htm">Management
by Objectives (MBO)</a>: Aims to align goals and subordinate objectives
throughout the organization. Ideally, employees get strong input
to identifying their objectives, time lines for completion, etc.
Includes ongoing tracking and feedback in process to reach objectives.
MBO's are often perceived as a form of planning.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizing/index.htm">Outcome-Based
Evaluation (particularly for nonprofits)</a>: Outcomes-based evaluation
is increasingly used, particularly by nonprofit organizations,
to assess the impact of their services and products on their target
communities. The process includes identifying preferred outcomes
to accomplish with a certain target market, associate indicators
as measures for each of those outcomes and then carry out the
measures to assess the extent of outcomes reached.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/organizing/index.htm">Program
Evaluation</a>: Program evaluation is used for a wide variety
of applications, e.g., to increase efficiencies of program processes
and thereby cut costs, to assess if program goals were reached
or not, to quality programs for accreditation, etc.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm">Strategic
Planning</a>: Organization-wide process to identify strategic
direction, including vision, mission, values and overall goals.
Direction is pursued by implementing associated action plans,
including multi-level goals, objectives, time lines and responsibilities.
Strategic planning is, of course, a form of planning.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://managementhelp.org/quality/total-quality-management.htm">Total
Quality Management (TQM)</a>: Set of management practices throughout
the organization to ensure the organization consistently meets
or exceeds customer requirements. Strong focus on process measurement
and controls as means of continuous improvement. TQM is a quality
initiative.</p>

<p>NOTE: There are various other approaches that, if used comprehensively
with strong focus on achieving organizational results, can be
used to increase organizational performance, e.g., <a href="http://www.margaret.net/spc/"
