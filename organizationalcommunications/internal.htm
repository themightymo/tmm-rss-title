<P>Most experts on organizations, management and leadership, assert that effective 
  communications is the foundation for effectiveness in any type of organization. 
  They assert there can't be too much communication. Some leaders misinterpret 
  communications to be the same as paperwork or bureaucracy and so they're averse 
  to a high degree of communications. As leaders and managers mature, they realize 
  the need to effective convey and receive information, and efforts at communications 
  (internal and external) increase substantially.</P>

<H2>Purpose of this Document</H2>

Texts on organizational communications tend to first examine basics
concepts such as &quot;communications&quot;, &quot;sender&quot;,
&quot;receivers&quot;, &quot;encoders&quot;, etc. They go on to
examine aspects of communications, e.g., downward, upward, body,
verbal, written, formal and informal, interpersonal and group,
etc. Some texts include various means to analyze effectiveness
of communications. Some writers include public relations and media
relations in organizational communications.</P>

<P>This document is geared to provide practical suggestions for
nonprofit leaders and managers to ensure sufficient communications
within their nonprofits and with external stakeholders. Public
relations and media relations are outside the range of this document.
Communications is one of those topics that tend to leave people
feeling somewhat confused or sometimes bored. People get confused
because communications is such a broad topic and it seems to somehow
relate to everything. People who get bored assume that they've
been communicating since childhood so why bring up the topic of
communications. Consequently, it may be most useful in this document
to start with common pitfalls in communications and then provide
a range of items that can be used to enhance communications.</P>

<P>Note that many organizations take a deliberate, formal approach
to ensuring sound communications, (both internal and external)
by developing a communications plan.</P>

<H2>Common Causes of Problems in Internal Communications</H2>

1. <B>If I know it, then everyone must know it.
</B><BR>Perhaps the most common communications problem is managements'
(leaders' and managers') assumption that because they are aware
of some piece of information, than everyone else is, too. Usually
staff aren't aware unless management makes a deliberate attempt
to carefully convey information.<BR>
2. <B>We hate bureaucracy -- we're &quot;lean and mean.&quot;
</B><BR>When organizations are just getting started, their leaders
can often prize themselves on not being burdened with what seems
as bureaucratic overhead, that is, as extensive written policies
and procedures. Writing something down can be seen as a sign of
bureaucracy and to be avoided. As the organization grows, it needs
more communications and feedback to remain healthy, but this communication
isn't valued. As a result, increasing confusion ensues -- unless
management matures and realizes the need for increased, reliable
communications. <BR>
3. <B>I told everyone, or some people, or ...? </B><BR>Another
frequent problem is managements' not really valuing communications
or assuming that it just happens. So they're not aware of what
they told to whom -- even when they intended for everyone to know
the information.<BR>
4. <B>Did you hear what I meant for you to hear? </B><BR>With
today's increasingly diverse workforce, it's easy to believe you've
conveyed information to someone, but you aren't aware that they
interpreted you differently than you intended. Unfortunately,
you won't be aware of this problem until a major problem or issue
arises out of the confusion.<BR>
5. <B>Our problems are too big to have to listen to each other!
</B><BR>Particularly when personnel are tired or under stress,
it's easy to do what's urgent rather than what's important. So
people misunderstand others' points or understand their intentions.
This problem usually gets discovered too late, too. <BR>
6. <B>So what's to talk about? </B><BR>Lastly, communications
problems can arise when inexperienced management interprets its
job to be solving problems and if they're aren't any problems/crises,
then there's nothing that needs to be communicated.<BR>
7. <B>There's data and there's information. </B><BR>As organizations
grow, their management tends to focus on matters of efficiency.
They often generate systems that produce substantial amount of
data -- raw information that doesn't seem to really be important.
<BR>
7. <B>If I need your opinion, I'll tell it to you. </B><BR>Lastly,
communications problems can arise when management simply sees
no value whatsoever in communicating with subordinates, believing
subordinates should shut up and do their jobs.</P>

<H2>Key Principles
to Effective Internal Organizational Communications</H2>

1. Unless management comprehends and fully supports
the premise that organizations must have high degrees of communications
(like people needing lots of water), the organization will remain
stilted. Too often, management learns the need for communication
by having to respond to the lack of it. <BR>
2. Effective internal communications start with effective skills
in communications, including basic skills in listening, speaking,
questioning and sharing feedback.  See 
<A CLASS=TEXTLINK href="http://www.managementhelp.org/communicationsskills/index.htm" target="_blank">Communications Skills</A>.<BR>
These can developed with some concerted review and
practice. Perhaps the most important outcome from these skills
is conveying that you value hearing from others and their hearing
from you. <BR>
3. Sound meeting management skills go a long way toward ensuring
effective communications, too. See 
<A CLASS=TEXTLINK href="http://www.managementhelp.org/misc/meeting-management.htm" target="_blank">Guidelines
for Effective Meeting Management</A>.<BR>
4. A key ingredient to developing effective communications in
any organization is each person taking responsibility to assert
when they don't understand a communication or to suggest when
and how someone could communicate more effectively.</P>

<H2>Basic Structures/Policies
to Support Effective Internal Communications</H2>
This communication can be looked at as communications
downward and upward.<BR>
<H3>Downward Communications:</H3>
1. Ensure every employee receives a copy of the strategic
plan, which includes the organization's mission, vision, values
statement, strategic goals and strategies about how those goals
will be reached.<BR>
2. Ensure every employee receives an employee handbook that contains
all up-to-date personnel policies.<BR>
3. Develop a basic set of procedures for how routine tasks are
conducted and include them in standard operating manual.<BR>
4. Ensure every employee has a copy of their job description and
the organization chart. <BR>
5. Regularly hold management meetings (at least every two weeks),
even if there's nothing pressing to report. If you hold meetings
only when you believe there's something to report, then communications
will occur only when you have something to say -- communications
will be one way and the organization will suffer. Have meetings
anyway, if only to establish and affirm the communication that
things are of a status that there's not immediate problems. <BR>
6. Hold full staff meetings every month to report how the organization
is doing, major accomplishments, concerns, announcements about
staff, etc.<BR>
7. Leaders and managers should have face-to-face contact with
employees at least once a week. Even if the organization is over
20 employees (large for a nonprofit), management should stroll
by once in a while.<BR>
8. Regularly hold meetings to celebrate major accomplishments.
This helps employees perceive what's important, gives them a sense
of direction and fulfillment, and let's them know that leadership
is on top of things.<BR>
9. Ensure all employees receive yearly performance reviews, including
their goals for the year, updated job descriptions, accomplishments,
needs for improvement, and plans to help the employee accomplish
the improvements. If the nonprofit has sufficient resources (a
realistic concern), develop a career plan with the employee, too.<BR>
<H3>Upward Communications:</H3>
1. Ensure all employees give regular status reports to
their supervisors. Include a section for what they did last week,
will do next week and any actions/issues to address.<BR>
2. Ensure all supervisors meet one-on-one at least once a month
with their employees to discuss how its' going, hear any current
concerns from the employee, etc. Even if the meeting is chit-chat,
it cultivates an important relationship between supervisor and
employee.<BR>
3. Use management and staff meetings to solicit feedback. Ask
how it's going. Do a round table approach to hear from each person.
<BR>
4. Act on feedback from others. Write it down. Get back to it
-- if only to say you can't do anything about the reported problem
or suggestion, etc.<BR>
5. Respect the &quot;grapevine.&quot; It's probably one of the
most prevalent and reliable forms of communications. Major &quot;movements&quot;
in the organization usually first appear when employees feel it
safe to venture their feelings or opinions to peers.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="anchor1548124"></A>
<H2>Supervisor and
Employee Communications</H2>

Supervision is often considered
to include designing the job, hiring someone to fill the job,
training them, delegating to them, guiding them via performance
reviews, helping them develop their career, noting performance
issues, and firing them, if needed. Obviously small nonprofits
may not be able to afford full attention to all of these activities.
</P>

<P>However, there are several basic and
regular activities which provide a solid foundation for effective
supervision. These basics ensure that everyone is working together
-- as important, that staff <I>feel </I>they are working together
-- towards a common cause.</P>

<P>Ironically, these basics are usually
the first activities that stop when an organization is in a crisis.
Consequently, an organization development specialist, when &quot;diagnosing&quot;
an organization, often first looks to see if these basics are
underway. The following activities should be conducted by the
new employer's supervisor.<BR>
1. <B>Have all employees provide weekly written status reports
to their supervisors. </B><BR>Include what tasks were done last
week, what tasks are planned next week, any pending issues and
date the report. These reports may seem a tedious task, but they're
precious in ensuring that employee and their supervisor have mutual
understanding of what is going on, and the reports come in very
handy for planning purposes. They also make otherwise harried
staff and managers stand back and reflect on what they're doing.<BR>
2. <B>Hold monthly meetings with all staff together</B><BR>
- Review the overall condition of the organization and review
recent successes. Consider conducting &quot;in service&quot; training
where employees take turns describing their roles to the rest
of the staff. For clarity, focus and morale, be sure to use agendas
and ensure follow-up minutes. Consider bringing in a client to
tell their story of how the organization helped them. These meetings
go a long way toward building a feeling of teamwork among staff.
See <A CLASS=TEXTLINK href="http://www.managementhelp.org/misc/meeting-management.htm" target="_blank">Guidelines for Meeting Management</A>.<BR>
3. <B>Hold weekly or biweekly meetings with all staff together
if the organization is small (e.g., under 10 people); otherwise,
with all managers together.</B> <BR>Have these meetings
even if there is not a specific problem to solve -- just make
them shorter. (Holding meetings only when there are problems to
solve cultivates a crisis-oriented environment where managers
believe their only job is to solve problems.) Use these meetings
for each person to briefly give an overview of what they are doing
that week. Facilitate the meetings to support exchange of ideas
and questions. Again, for clarity, focus and morale, be sure to
use agendas, take minutes and ensure follow-up minutes. Have each
person bring their calendar to ensure scheduling of future meetings
accommodates each person's calendar.<BR>
4. <B>Have supervisors meet with their direct reports in one-on-one
meetings every month - </B><BR>This ultimately produces more efficient
time management and supervision. Review overall status of work
activities, hear how it's going with both the supervisor and the
employee, exchange feedback and questions about current programs
and services, and discuss career planning, etc. Consider these
meetings as interim meetings between the more formal, yearly performance
review meetings.</P>

<H2>Develop a Basic
Communications Plan</H2>

Whether planning your internal or external communications
efforts, it helps a great deal to develop a communications plan,
either informally or formally. For example, consider:<BR>
1. What key messages do you want to convey?<BR>
2. To what key stakeholders do you want to convey the key messages
(e.g., consider clients, funders, community leaders, service providers,
etc.)?<BR>
3. What's the best approach to reach each key stakeholder, including
who/how should the message be conveyed?<BR>
4. How will you know if you're reaching these stakeholders or
not?</P>
